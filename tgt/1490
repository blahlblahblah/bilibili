抽水蓄能电站是调节电力需求峰谷差的必备电源，但因为无法纳入输配电价、也缺乏市场化价格机制，三个月前曾被国家电网叫停新项目建设文 | 韩舒淋编辑 | 马克2月18日上午，国家电网公司董事长、党组书记毛伟明宣布山西垣曲抽水蓄能电站项目开工，标志着工程建设全面启动。
Pumped-storage power station is a must-have source of power for adjusting peak-valley differences in electricity demand, but was shut down three months ago by the State Grid Corp. Chairman and Party Secretary Mao Weiming announced the start of the Shanxi Yuanqu pumped storage power station project, marking the start of full construction.
抽水蓄能电站（下称抽蓄电站）的功能是调峰，即在用电高峰时段填补其它电源的不足。
The function of a pumped storage plant (hereinafter referred to as a pumping station) is to peak, that is, to fill other power shortages during peak periods.
2月7日，国家电网出台应对疫情影响、全力设助推企业复工复产12项举措，开工这一项目即是落实这些举措的行动之一。
The start of the project is part of a 12-step initiative launched by the State Grid on 7 February to address the impact of the epidemic and to reactivate businesses that promote the resumption of work.
12项举措的第3项，是加大新项目投资力度，新开工陕北～武汉±800千伏特高压直流工程、山西垣曲抽水蓄能电站等一批工程，总投资265亿元。
The third of the 12 measures is to increase investment in new projects, with a total investment of 26.5 billion yuan for new projects such as the Shaanxi-Wuhan ± 800 kV ultra-high-voltage DC project and the Shanxi Yuanqu pumped-storage power station.
两个新开工项目中，抽蓄电站的重启有些特殊。
In the two new projects, the restarting of the pumping station is special.
在上一任国家电董事长寇伟在任期间，2019年11月，国家电网曾发文严控电网投资，其中提出以产出定投入，严控电网投资规模，并明确提出不再安排抽水蓄能新项目开工。
Under Koo Wei, the last national electricity chairman, in November 2019, the National Grid issued a letter tightening electricity grid investment, proposing output-oriented inputs, tightening the scale of grid investment and making clear that no new projects for pumping energy would be scheduled to start.
2020年1月17日，国家电网意外换帅，原董事长寇伟调任至发电集团大唐任总经理，原江西省副省长毛伟明调任至国家电网任董事长，成为国家电网首位非电力企业出身的董事长。
January 17, 2020, the national grid accident Shuai Wei, former chairman of the power generation group transferred to Tang as general manager, former vice-governor of Jiangxi Province Mao Weiming transferred to the State Grid as chairman, becoming the first non-power company-based chairman of the national grid.
在叫停抽蓄电站项目建设3个月后，为应对疫情影响，推动复工复产，国家电网再次重启了抽蓄电站建设。
Three months after the stoppage of the pumping station project, the State Grid restarted construction of the pumping station in response to the impact of the epidemic and to promote the resumption of production.
该抽蓄项目位于山西省垣曲县解峪乡境内，装机容量120万千瓦，安装4台30万千瓦可逆变式抽水蓄能机组，总投资79.6亿元。
The project, which is located in Jiayuxiang township of Wangqu County, Shanxi Province, has an installed capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts and four 3000kW reversible pumped storage units with a total investment of 7.96 billion yuan.
2019年12月16日获得山西省发改委核准批复，预计2028年全部投产发电。
Approved by the Shanxi Development and Reform Commission on 16 December 2019 and expected to be fully operational by 2028.
国家电网发布的信息显示，工程将直接带动上下游产业复工复产，增加发电装备制造业产值约20亿元，并估算建设期间平均每年增加地方财政收入约1.5亿元，提供各类就业岗位3500个，运行期间每年增加财政收入约1.1亿元，并带动其他产业发展。
The information released by the State Grid shows that the project will directly bring the upstream and downstream industries back to work and increase the output value of the power generation equipment manufacturing industry by about RMB 2 billion.
在新的抽蓄电站项目开工之前，原有在建的抽蓄项目也已经开始复工。
Prior to the start of the new pumping station project, the pre-existing pumping projects had also begun to resume work.
2月14日、15日，国网新源公司旗下的辽宁清原抽水蓄能电站、河北丰宁抽水蓄能电站先后复工。
On February 14 and 15, the Liaoning Qingyuan Pumped Storage Power Station and the Hebei Fengning Pumped Storage Power Station, both of which are owned by Xinyuan Corporation, resumed work.
这两个项目总投资300亿元，装机容量分别为180万千瓦和360万千瓦，其中装机容量360万千瓦的丰宁抽水蓄能电站是目前全球装机容量最大的抽蓄电站。
The two projects have a total investment of 30 billion yuan and an installed capacity of 1.8 million kilowatts and 3.6 million kilowatts, respectively, of which the Fengning pumped storage power station with an installed capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts is the largest pumping station in the world.
截止2019年底，国家电网在建、在运的抽蓄电站规模分别为1946万千瓦和3585万千瓦。
By the end of 2019, the scale of pumped power stations under construction or in operation in the national power grid was 1,946 million kilowatts and 35.85 million kilowatts, respectively.
抽蓄电站的建设，可以增加电力系统的调峰能力。
The construction of pumped power station can increase the peak adjusting ability of power system.
在山西当地，电力结构以火电为主，装机占比达到72%，且未来峰谷负荷差将进一步加大，建设抽蓄电站可以用来削峰填谷，缓解调峰压力，提高电网运行的经济性、安全性和稳定性。
In Shanxi, the electric power structure mainly consists of thermal power, which accounts for 72% of the total installed capacity, and the load difference between peak and valley will be further increased.
国网信息显示，该电站设计年发电量12亿千瓦时，年抽水电量16亿千瓦时。
The plant is designed to generate 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours of water annually, according to state-run Web.
不过对于抽蓄电站来说，价格机制缺失，让收回投资成为最大困难，也是此前国网叫停抽蓄电站建设的重要原因。
However, for the pumping station, the price mechanism is missing, which makes the recovery of investment the most difficult, and is the main reason why the network stopped the construction of pumping power station.
此前抽蓄电站主要由电网公司来投资。
Previously, pumping stations were mainly invested by power grid companies.
但在2019年5月，国家发改委、国家能源局发布《输配电价成本监审办法》，规定抽水蓄能的成本费用不得计入输配电价定价成本，这意味着电网公司只能自行消化对抽蓄电站的投资。
However, in May 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Energy Administration promulgated the Measures for the Supervision and Examination of Transmission and Distribution Price Costs, which stipulate that the cost of pumping energy shall not be included in the pricing cost of transmission and distribution prices, which means that power grid companies can only absorb their own investment in pumping stations.
随着始于2015年的新一轮电改推进，电价管制虽然逐步放开，但波动幅度总体有限，目前储能的投资很难通过峰谷价差来实现盈利。
With a new round of electricity reforms starting in 2015, price controls, although gradually liberalized, are generally limited and it is difficult for current energy-storage investments to be profitable through peak-valley spreads.
当前国内开展试点的8个现货市场，其申报或出清价格都有波动幅度限制。
At present, there are eight spot markets in China where the declared or cleared prices are subject to fluctuation limits.
有电网相关专家曾对《财经》记者分析，若政府将价格波动限制在3到5倍，那么电力现货市场很难养活抽水蓄能。
Grid experts have told Caijing that if the government limits price fluctuations to three to five times, it is difficult for the spot market to feed pumped energy.
不过疫情压力之下，复工复产成了更重要的决策考量。
However, under the pressure of the epidemic, the resumption of work is a more important decision-making consideration.
国家电网发布的消息中表示，开工建设山西垣曲抽水蓄能电站项目，是国家电网公司落实党中央、国务院决策部署，在全力以赴抓好疫情防控的同时，统筹改革发展稳定各项任务，做好“六稳”工作，推动重大项目开工建设、助推企业有序复工复产的重要举措。
Construction of the Shanxi Yuanqu Pumped Storage Power Station is an important step taken by the State Grid Company to implement the decision-making arrangements of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council.While making every effort to prevent and control the epidemic, reform, development and stability, do a good job of "six stabilizers.
针对未来电力供需峰谷差加大、尖峰负荷增加的趋势，多位电力专家对《财经》记者表示，市场机制是保障各类技术创新的基础。
In response to the trend of increasing power supply and demand gap and peak load in the future, many power experts told Caijing that market mechanism is the basis of guaranteeing various kinds of technological innovation.
无论是抽水蓄能，还是电化学储能、需求侧管理等各类新技术，都需要更加市场化的机制，通过价格信号引导新技术的投资。
New technologies such as pumped storage, electrochemical energy storage and demand-side management all require more market-based mechanisms to channel investment in new technologies through price signals.
