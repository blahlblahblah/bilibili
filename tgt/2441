出院并不等于彻底痊愈2月27日，已经出院19天的徐州居民王先生核酸检测呈阳性，被再次收入定点医院医学观察。
discharge does not equal to complete recovery Feb. 27, Xuzhou resident Wang Nucleic Acid positive, has been discharged from hospital for 19 days, was re-admitted to hospital medical observation.
王先生在2月9日出院，经过14天隔离点观察后回家。
Mr. Wang was discharged from hospital on February 9 and returned home after 14 days of observation.
回家后三天，王先生在新闻上看到部分康复者复检呈阳性，主动要求再次进行核酸检测，结果显示呈阳性。
Three days after returning home, Mr. Wang saw on the news that some of the recovered were positive and volunteered to undergo a second nucleic acid test, which proved positive.
据王先生家属介绍，他出院前检查了咽拭子和粪便，肺部CT显示炎症吸收，“很长时间不发烧咳嗽”。
Mr. Wang's family said he checked swabs and faeces before he was discharged from the hospital. The pulmonary CT scan showed inflammation and absorption.
王先生回家当天，社区邻居为他举行了欢迎回家的仪式。
Mr. Wang went home the same day, the community neighbors for him to hold a welcome home ceremony.
如今，8名密切接触者也转移至集中隔离点观察，王先生居住的单元楼65人进行居家隔离。
Now, eight close contacts have also been moved to the central isolation point, where 65 people in Mr. Wang's apartment building are isolated.
2月以来，成都、武汉和广东各地也出现了出院患者复检呈阳性的病例。
Since February, cases of patients returning from hospitals in Chengdu, Wuhan and Guangdong have also been tested positive.
其中，广东省14%出院患者存在复检阳性现象。
Among them, 14% of patients discharged from Guangdong Province had positive reexamination.
在国务院联防联控机制2月28日召开的新闻发布会上，国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红介绍了各地出院患者复诊中核酸阳性的情况。
At a press conference held on February 28 by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council, Guo Yanhong, an inspector of the National Health Care and Health Administration, introduced the situation of nucleic acid-positive patients undergoing reexamination.
通过监测发现，这部分患者没有再发生传染别人的现象，另外有一部分患者再进行核酸检测时，结果又转为阴性。
The surveillance found that this part of the patients no longer transmission to other people, and another part of the patients when nucleic acid testing, the results turned negative.
出院不等于彻底痊愈在国家卫健委发布的第六版新冠肺炎诊疗方案中，患者出院和接触隔离需要满足4个表现，即体温恢复正常3天以上，呼吸道症状明显好转，CT显示急性渗出性病变明显改善和两次呼吸道核酸检测阴性。
Discharge is not the same as complete convalescence In the sixth edition of the new crown pneumonia diagnosis and treatment programme issued by the National Institutes of Health, patient discharge and isolation require four manifestations, namely, a return to normal body temperature for more than three days, marked improvement in respiratory symptoms, and CT findings of significant improvement in acute exudative lesions and negative two RNA tests.
其中，两次核酸检测的采样时间至少间隔一天。
Two nucleic acid tests took at least one day apart.
然而，出院并不等于彻底痊愈。
However, discharge from hospital is not a complete recovery.
中南大学湘雅二医院医院感染控制中心主任童德军对《中国新闻周刊》表示，“出院标准中写的症状明显好转，渗出性病变明显改善，并不等于完全没症状，有患者还有一些轻微的呼吸道症状比如咳嗽，渗出性病变可能仍有存在，只是较前有明显改善也可以出院，大部分病人在出院以后会自行痊愈。
"The symptoms described in the discharge standards are significantly better and the exudative lesions are not the same as no symptoms at all," Tong German Jun, director of the infection control center at Xiangya II Hospital, told China News Weekly.
”广东省人民政府新闻在2月25日举行发布会，省疾控中心副主任宋铁表示，“部分出院患者的肺部炎症在吸收过程中，不能说是临床意义的痊愈，这种情况可能间歇性存在排毒现象。
"Inflammation in the lungs of some patients discharged from hospitals is not a clinical cure," Song Tie, deputy director of the provincial centre for disease control, said in a press release on Feb. 25.
”新冠肺炎诊疗方案中规定，患者出院后应继续进行14天自我健康状况监测，佩戴口罩，有条件的居住在通风良好的单人间，减少与家人近距离密切接触，分餐饮食，做好手卫生，避免外出活动。
The programme calls for patients to continue monitoring their self-health for 14 days after discharge, wearing masks, living in well-ventilated single rooms, reducing close contact with their families, sharing meals, keeping hands clean and avoiding outdoor activities.
另外，出院注意事项中还规定，患者出院第2周和第4周应到医院复诊。
In addition, discharge instructions stipulate that patients should be referred to the hospital in the second and fourth weeks of discharge.
据了解，湖北、广东、江苏等地在具体落实中更严格，将出院患者集中收入医学隔离点观察，进行统一的健康监测和健康指导，减少出院患者再次传染的风险。
It is understood that in Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu and other places in the implementation of more stringent, discharged patients will be concentrated into medical isolation points observation, unified health monitoring and health guidance, to reduce the risk of re-infection of patients discharged from hospital.
但是仍出现了出院患者经过隔离期后，复检结果阳性的情况。
However, there are still patients discharged from the hospital after isolation period, the results of the positive re-examination.
宋铁强调，如果患者在出院后出现复检阳性，“肯定就是传染源，在防控方面要按照传染源来管理。
Song Tie stressed that if the patient is positive after discharge from hospital, "is certainly the source of infection, in terms of prevention and control to be managed according to the source of infection.
”对于这部分患者，要重新收回定点医院隔离观察，等到连续两次的核酸检测阴性，才可再出院。
For this group of patients, it is necessary to recall the designated hospital isolation observation and wait until two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests before being released.
“对于传染病防控来讲，患者只要检测出来有病毒，就可以成为一个传染病源，所以尽管他没有症状，也要求要把他隔离起来，这是出于传染病防控考虑。
"For infectious disease control, a patient can be a source of infection if he detects a virus, so he needs to be quarantined even if he doesn't have symptoms," he said.
”负责湘雅二医院院内感染防控的童德军向《中国新闻周刊》解释。
"Tong German Army, who is responsible for infection control in the Xiangya II hospital compound, explained to China News Weekly.
“对于复检阳性患者，如症状无加重，再次住院可能并不需要特殊治疗，注意追踪观察体内新冠抗体的产生情况，靠人体自身免疫即可清除掉病毒。
"For patients who are re-tested positive, re-hospitalization may not require special treatment if the symptoms are not aggravated. Follow up the production of new crown antibodies in the body, and the virus can be eliminated by the body's own immunity.
”对于各地出现的新冠病人出院后复阳的现象，国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红表示，除了要加强对出院患者的管理，还需要进一步加深对新冠病毒的致病机理、疾病的全貌和病程特点的认识。
"In addition to strengthening the management of patients discharged from hospital, we need to further deepen our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism, full appearance and course characteristics of the new crown virus," said Guo Yanhong, an inspector at the National Health Administration of the Hospital Authority.
据了解，钟南山团队正在对复阳现象做进一步研究。
It is understood that Zhong Nan Shan team is doing further research on the phenomenon of Fuyang.
复阳患者的传染力根据宋铁介绍，通过实验室观察，年轻的、轻症的患者在两周后会产生抗体，如果再出现阳性，传播风险也很低。
According to Song Tiehua, young, mild patients develop antibodies after two weeks and the risk of transmission is low if they become positive again, according to Song Tiewei.
老年人产生抗体的时间比较长，在不断排毒过程中，可能会成为传染源。
Older people produce antibodies for a longer period of time, in the process of continuous detoxification, may become a source of infection.
清华大学全球健康与传染病研究中心、清华大学艾滋病综合研究中心主任张林琦对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，当免疫系统战胜新冠病毒，病毒会被完全排除体外。
Zhang Lin Qi, director of the Center for Global Health and Infectious Diseases Research at Tsinghua University and the Center for Comprehensive Research on AIDS at Tsinghua University, told China News Weekly that when the immune system overcomes the new crown virus, the virus will be completely eliminated.
“它不像慢性感染病毒，比如乙肝病毒，艾滋病毒是一个长期的感染。
"Unlike chronic infections like hepatitis B virus, HIV is a long-term infection.
从现在的了解来看，康复者如果治愈了，那病毒在一段时间就会就会被清除掉。
It is now understood that if the recovered person is cured, the virus will be removed over a period of time.
”新冠肺炎的患者从感染到发病再到恢复，这个过程伴随着体内病毒逐渐增加，再逐渐降低，是一个连续的过程。
The progression from infection to illness to recovery in patients with new crown pneumonia is a continuous process, with the virus building up in the body and decreasing over time.
这个过程中，存在一个阶段是人体感觉已经恢复得不错，但是本身依然带毒的状态。
In this process, there is a phase in which the body feels like it has recovered well but is still poisoned.
“但带毒量是多少，一共带毒多长时间，还缺乏科学的结论。
"But there is a lack of scientific conclusions about how much poison it is and how long it takes.
”在这个阶段，有可能因为采样技术，检测试剂准确性等原因导致核酸结果为假阴性，让带有病毒的患者出院。
At this stage, it is possible that sampling techniques, tests for reagent accuracy, etc., can lead to false-negative nucleic acid results and release patients with the virus.
张林琦教授认为，我们对于出院患者复阳现象不必过多担忧，现有的出院标准和出院隔离措施已经减少了假阴患者传染他人的风险。
Professor Zhang said we should not worry too much about the phenomenon of reyang in patients discharged from hospital. Existing discharge standards and isolation measures have reduced the risk of transmission from sham patients to others.
另外，一个人被传染病毒的条件，取决于病原体的载量，以及病毒的传染力、毒力。
In addition, a person is infected with the virus, depending on the load of pathogens, as well as the virus's infectious power, virulence.
当一个人接触很少量的病毒，人体可能直接把它清除而不发病，比如很多确诊患者的密切接触者并没发病。
When a person is exposed to a very small amount of the virus, the body may clear it directly without getting sick, as many close contacts of confirmed patients do not.
假阴性的多重因素目前，新冠肺炎患者的确诊和出院的决策，在一定程度上依赖于核酸检测的结果。
False-Negative Multiple Factors At present, the diagnosis and decision-making of patients with new crown pneumonia depend to some extent on the results of nucleic acid testing.
提高检测结果的准确性，能够有效避免假阴性病例。
To improve the accuracy of the test results, can effectively avoid false negative cases.
但是由于核酸试剂的准确性，采样技术和样本获得限制等原因，限制了核酸检测的准确性。
However, the accuracy of nucleic acid detection is limited by the accuracy of nucleic acid reagents, sampling techniques and sample acquisition restrictions.
根据童德军主任的介绍，新冠病毒引发的感染主要发生在下呼吸道，留取下呼吸道分泌物可以加大这个阳性的检测率。
According to the director of the German Children's Army, the new crown virus infection occurred mainly in the lower respiratory tract, the retention of lower respiratory secretions can increase the positive detection rate.
因此，呼吸道越深部收集到的标本，阳性检出率越高。
Therefore, the deeper the respiratory tract collected specimens, the higher the positive detection rate.
目前采样的几种标本的阳性检出率从高到低排列为，肺泡灌洗液>痰液>咽拭子>粪便。
Positive detection rates ranged from high to low at present in several samples: alveolar lavage & gt; sputum & gt; pharynx & gt; faeces.
肺泡灌洗液通常是重症患者做肺泡冲洗治疗过程中，收集到的冲洗液。
Pulmonary alveolar lotion is usually collected during alveolar washing in severe cases.
痰液和平时咳出口腔分泌的痰不同，它是指清晨漱口以后咳出呼吸道深部的痰。
The sputum is different from the sputum secreted by the mouth. It refers to the sputum in the deep respiratory tract after gargling in the morning.
由于轻症患者发病症状为干咳，无法得到肺泡灌洗液或痰液，很多患者只能用上呼吸道的标本，即咽拭子来做检测。
Because the symptoms of mild cases of dry cough, lung alveolar lotion or sputum, many patients can only use specimens of the upper respiratory tract, that is, swabs to test.
需要注意的是，咽拭子取样的时机、取样的具体位置和咽拭子涂擦情况，都会影响到核酸检测的准确率。
It is important to note that the timing of swabs sampling, the exact location of sampling, and pharyngeal wipe will affect the accuracy of nucleic acid testing.
“比如对于密切接触者来说，如他被感染，在其症状出现前两天开始可能有病毒排出，随着症状加重，排毒量逐步加大，阳性检出率也就越高。
"For example, for close contacts, if he is infected, the virus may be excreted two days before the symptoms develop, and the higher the level of detoxification, the higher the positive detection rate."
”童德军主任介绍。
"Introduction by the director of Tong German Army.
另外，标本不能及时送检，或者运输过程中没有做好保存，会出现降解情况，这也是导致假阴性的因素。
In addition, specimens can not be sent for inspection in time, or not well preserved during transport, degradation will occur, which is also a factor leading to false negativity.
为了提高核酸检测的及时性和准确性，核酸样本检测已经从早期必须由疾控中心检测来确定阳性，改为经授权的定点医疗检测机构可以独立出具阳性报告。
In order to improve the timeliness and accuracy of nucleic acid testing, nucleic acid sample testing has been changed from early detection by the CDC to an independent positive report by an authorized sentinel medical testing facility.
值得关注的是，血清抗体检测作为核酸检测的补充，将辅助医生判断患者的感染情况。
It is worth noting that seroantibody testing, as a supplement to nucleic acid testing, will assist doctors in judging the patient's infection.
如果血清抗体检测显示为IgM抗体,说明患者处于感染的早期；IgG抗体在人体中产生较晚，持续时间较长，IgG抗体明显升高提示近期有感染。
If the serum antibody test shows IgM antibody, it indicates that the patient is in the early stage of infection; IgG antibody is produced later in the body and lasts longer.
据了解，目前国内已经有多个厂商生产了血清抗体检测的试剂盒。
It is understood that at present there are a number of domestic manufacturers of serum antibody detection kit.
湘雅二医院已经使用血清抗体检测作为多次核酸检测结果存疑的病例补充诊断依据。
Serum antibody detection has been used in Xiangya II Hospital as a supplementary diagnostic basis for cases with suspected multiple nucleic acid test results.
