武汉市民王应萍是六角亭院区老年心身病区的住院病人，她今年64岁，患有阿尔兹海默症，去年8月住进这家医院。
Wang Yingping, a 64-year-old inpatient with Alzheimer's disease, was admitted to the hospital in August last year.
1月26日，医院给王的老伴黄先生打来电话，称其妻发烧38度，于当天下午退烧。
On January 26, the hospital called Wang's wife, Mr. Huang, saying she had a fever of 38 degrees.
王应萍当天的血常规结果为白细胞正常偏低、淋巴细胞减少，与新冠肺炎早期症状相近。
The routine results of Wang Yingping's day were low leukocyte normality and lymphocyte reduction, which were similar to early CG symptoms.
27日，王应萍进行了核酸检测与CT检查。
On July 27, Wang Yingping had a nucleic acid test and CT examination.
CT显示右上肺呈片状阴影，有炎症改变，2月2日核酸检测结果为阴性。

据黄先生了解，此前一天，该院进行核酸检测的6人中，有4人的结果为阳性。
The previous day, four out of six people tested positive for nucleic acid at the hospital, Mr. Huang said.
2月2日与王应萍同批检测的6名病人中，有3人的结果为阳性，而这3名病人均与王应萍同一病房。

到了2月5日，王应萍再次发高烧，次日开始神志不清，双肺啰音。
On February 5, Wang Yingping had a high fever again and began to lose consciousness the next day.
黄先生称，老伴这时候白细胞已经很高了，是最高正常值的近三倍。

王应萍的新护工也在2月5日下午出现了发热症状，并于第二天辞职。
Wang Yingping's new nurse also developed fever symptoms on the afternoon of February 5 and resigned the next day.
6日中午，王应萍被转入精神卫生中心的ICU接受治疗。

医院告诉黄先生，病人的血氧饱和度已经下降，可能出现最坏的结果，即病人死亡。
The hospital told Mr. Huang that the patient's oxygen saturation had decreased and that the worst possible outcome could be death.
据该院医生赵平介绍，武汉市精神卫生中心的ICU不是标准的隔离病房，也没有负压装置，只能进行气管插管、雾化等几种支持治疗。
According to Zhao Ping, the hospital doctor, Wuhan Mental Health Center ICU is not a standard isolation room, there is no negative pressure device, can only carry out trachea intubation, atomization and other support treatment.
武汉金银潭医院为该院感染新冠肺炎的精神疾病病人开设了专门病区，于2月3日启用，共有30张病床。
Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital opened a special ward for mental patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia on February 3, with a total of 30 beds.
但赵平也表示，这个数字远远不够。
But Zhao said the figure was far from enough.

At present, the patient has changed from severe to critical, blood oxygen saturation has been reduced to more than 70, and the heart rate due to hypoxia due to dyspnea has increased and the hospital has given him a ventilator.
院内感染严重，疑与调整病区有关据该院医生赵平介绍，王应萍的发热情况并非个案。
Hospital infection is serious, suspected and adjust the disease area according to the hospital doctor Zhao Ping, Wang Yingping's fever is not a case.
从1月12日开始，六角亭院区三病区（女性病区）开始出现聚集性发热现象，有10余人均出现发热症状。
From January 12 onwards, the hexagonal pavilion courtyard three disease area (female disease area) began to appear the aggregation febrile phenomenon, more than 10 people have febrile symptoms.

此后出现患者高烧不退、呼吸衰竭的现象。
Since then, patients with high fever, respiratory failure.
武汉市精神卫生中心的第一例新冠确诊病例是在1月20日前后检出的，之后该病人被转到了武汉协和医院。
The first confirmed case was detected around January 20 at Wuhan Mental Health Center, after which the patient was transferred to Wuhan Concorde Hospital.
24日开始，王应萍所在的老年心身病区也出现聚集性发热现象，患者多出现高热，后经核酸检测，确诊多例新冠肺炎病例。
24, Wang Yingping's elderly psychosomatic disease area also appeared the phenomenon of heat accumulation, high fever, after nucleic acid testing, confirmed a number of cases of new crown pneumonia.

Another staff member told China News Weekly that he tested positive for nucleic acid on February 7 and is now showing mild symptoms.
2月8日，二七院区成瘾病区又有三名医务人员核酸检测结果为阳性，还有其他疑似患者。
On 8 February, three more medical personnel tested positive for nucleic acid in the Addicted Areas of the 27-yard district, as well as other suspected patients.
检测结果为阳性的医务人员提出，希望院方能安排统一管理，但院方的回复是，医务人员自己回家隔离，联系社区，医院目前没有统一安排。
The medical staff who tested positive submitted that they wanted the hospital to arrange for a unified management, but the hospital responded by isolating themselves and contacting the community, and there was currently no centralized arrangement in the hospital.
据赵平透露，目前武汉市精神卫生中心包括副院长以及多名科主任、护士长在内的至少30名医务人员确认感染了新冠肺炎。
Zhao Ping revealed that at least 30 medical staff, including the vice-dean of Wuhan city's mental health center, as well as directors and head nurses, were confirmed to have contracted pneumonia.
该中心一位不愿透露姓名的医生表示，他是在1月26日医院组织新冠病毒核酸检测时，检出阳性结果的。
A doctor at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he tested positive for the new crown virus nucleic acid test at the hospital on January 26.
该院另一位护士表示，她是在1月31日医院组织CT筛查时发现肺部有问题，2月2日进行了病毒核酸检测，3日检测结果显示为阳性，目前症状较轻，正在居家隔离。
Another nurse at the hospital said she found lung problems during a CT scan on January 31 and a viral nucleic acid test on February 2. She tested positive three days later and now has mild symptoms and is being isolated at home.
《中国新闻周刊》联系到该中心分管副院长刘连忠，询问院内患者和医务人员感染情况。
China News Weekly contacted Liu Lianzhong, vice-president of the center, asking about the infection among hospital patients and medical staff.
刘在听完记者的问题后，马上挂断电话。
Liu hung up the phone immediately after listening to the reporter's question.
当记者再次拨打电话时，刘连忠不再接听。
When the reporter called again, Liu Lianzhong no longer answer the phone.
该院院长李毅也不愿透露具体情况，他表示，“我们现在有纪律要求，不能接受电话采访。
Li Yi, director of the hospital, also declined to give details, saying: "We are now disciplined enough not to give telephone interviews.
”对于造成院内感染和医务人员感染的原因，赵平认为有两个，一是医院重视程度不足，二是防护物资和药品未能及时到位。
Zhao Ping believes there are two reasons for hospital infections and infections among medical staff: inadequate hospital care and delays in the arrival of protective materials and drugs.
新冠肺炎疫情暴发后，1月21日，医院就宣布封闭管理。
After the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak, the hospital declared closed management on January 21.
但实际上，封闭措施实行得并不严格，有的家属还会往院里送东西，直到过年之后才逐渐严格起来。
In practice, however, the closure is not strictly enforced, and some families send goods to the courtyard until the New Year's Eve.
《中国新闻周刊》从医院内部了解到，1月25日左右，医院领导要求将十九病区、二病区和早期病区合并为发热隔离病区。
China News Weekly learned from within the hospital that around January 25, hospital leaders demanded that the 19, 2 and early disease areas be merged into a fever isolation area.
但合并后，新成立的病区内出现疑似病例，又随即进行病区的还原。
However, after the merger, the newly established disease areas appear suspected cases, and then proceed to the reduction of the disease area.
之后，原本未出现病例的病区也出现了疑似患者。
Since then, there have been no cases of the disease in the area also appeared suspected patients.
赵平说，医院在这个过程中考虑不成熟，没有从传染病的专业角度去进行调整，反而导致之前没有感染的病区出现了更多患者的感染，出现明显的聚集性发热的情况。
Zhao said the hospital was premature in the process and did not adjust professionally to the epidemic. Instead, it led to more infections in previously uninfected areas and a clear case of concentrated fever.
据赵平介绍，前期医务人员无防护装备，后期防护装备虽有改善，但是直到现在，进入污染区的医务人员仍然没有三级防护装备，只能做到二级防护，面罩等物资紧缺。
According to Zhao Ping, medical personnel had no protective equipment, although the late protection equipment has improved, but until now, the medical personnel entering the contaminated areas still do not have third-level protective equipment, can only achieve secondary protection, masks and other supplies in short supply.
赵平称，目前，武汉市精神卫生中心累计转到其他定点医院的病人人数已达四五十人，主要去向是金银潭医院。
At present, the number of patients transferred from Wuhan Mental Health Center to other designated hospitals has reached 40 to 50, with the main destination being Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, Zhao said.
而在2月6号，该精神卫生中心ICU已有一例确诊病人死亡，死者为老年病人。
And on February 6, the mental health center ICU has a confirmed case of death, the elderly patients.
