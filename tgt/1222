口罩成为了我们救命的稻草。
Masks become the straw that keeps us alive.
到处都在缺口罩、抢口罩，但口罩仍然相当紧缺。
Gaps and masks are everywhere, but masks are still in short supply.
这个时候，却有一些商家和个人，靠着国难大发横财，贩卖各种假口罩、不合格的口罩，或者趁机哄抬口罩价格。
At this time, however, some businesses and individuals, relying on the national disaster windfall, sold a variety of masks, unqualified masks, or take advantage of the opportunity to raise the price of masks.
虽然淘宝、微信都开通了举报渠道，国家也在大力打击，但当我收到一包简陋的“三无”N95口罩时，我发现这些渠道的举报效果并不好。
Although Taobao, micro-letters have opened the reporting channels, the state is also hard hit, but when I received a package of crude "three nothing" N95 masks, I found that these channels do not report good results.
一个小小的口罩，反映出时代的众生相。
A small mask, reflecting the reality of the times.
我想这样的例子仍有很多，但我们还是可以力所能及地做一些事情。
I think there are still a lot of examples, but there are things we can do.
下面是我和假口罩的故事。
Here's the story of me and the mask.
坎坷举报路1月23号，我分别在淘宝下了两个订单。
On January 23rd, I placed two separate orders with Taobao.
一单是“KN95防病菌呼吸阀口罩”，158元20个，平均8元一个；另一单是“医用口罩一次性透气病菌鼻炎卫生无菌加厚三层口罩”。
One is "KN95 germ-proof respirator", 158 yuan 20, average 8 yuan 1; the other is "Medical mask disposable air-permeable bacteria rhinitis sterile thickening three layer mask."
全是顺丰发货。
It's all Shunfeng.
因为抢到了这批口罩，当时离家很近的药店还有口罩的时候我没去囤货。
I didn't hoard the masks when I was near the drugstore and the mask.
分别在29号和30号，我收到了两单口罩，虽然慢了点，但疫情期间，都能理解，但打开包裹时吓了一跳——这是什么神秘的口罩！所谓的KN95口罩，只有透明塑料袋做了简易包装，就直接装在快递袋里。
On the 29th and 30th, I received two face masks, which, although slower, were understandable during the outbreak, but startled as I opened the package - what a mysterious mask! The so-called KN95 mask, which was simply packaged in clear plastic bags, was packed directly in express delivery bags.
收到的口罩有白、灰、黑三个颜色，有的包装袋上写着“折叠随弃式防尘口罩”，有的包装上什么也没有。
The face masks were received in white, grey and black, some with the words "Folding up with a Dust Mask" on them, and some with nothing on the package.
作者收到的“三无”N95口罩，有的包装袋上写着“折叠随弃式防尘口罩”，有的包装上什么也没有就口罩本身来说，上面也什么标识也没有，同个口罩上，只有一边印着“KN95”，另一边印着“PM2.5”。
The author received the "three-nil" N95 mask, some with the word "fold-up dust mask" on it, some with nothing on the mask itself and nothing on it. The only side of the mask was printed "KN95" on one side and "PM2.5" on the other.
想起不久前在网上看到有人贩卖回收口罩，面对这样的“三无”产品，心里难免害怕，于是我打开商品链接页，想看看其他收到的用户都有什么样的反馈。
Remembering that I had recently seen someone selling recycled masks on the Internet, I was afraid of such "three-nothing" products, so I opened the commodity link page to see how other users received feedback.
链接页上原来卖N95口罩的选项已经不在，现在卖的是其他口罩商品。
The original option on the link page to sell N95 masks is no longer available, but now sells other mask products.
我点进评论，发现其他消费者和我的疑惑是相似的：收到的口罩颜色不一、品牌混乱、数目不对，还有很多“三无”口罩。
I went into the comments and found that other consumers shared my doubts: the masks were received in different colors, with the wrong number of brands, and a lot of "three-nil" masks.
“全是普通防尘口罩。
"All ordinary dust masks.
”“没有外包装，没有生产编号，没有生产日子，没有厂商，没有厂址，没有防护标准，听家人说甚至有几个已经发霉了。
"" No outer packing, no production number, no production date, no manufacturer, no factory site, no standard of protection, even a few, according to my family, had become moldy.
”“跟新闻上曝出来的一模一样，都放起来包好，一个也不用了，浙江义乌口罩黑作坊，自己去搜。
'Just like what was revealed in the news, put it away and wrap it up. Not one of them is needed.
”甚至还有人收到的口罩上印着“赠品”“999感冒灵”。
Some even received masks with the words "Gifts" and "999 Colds."
口罩上，一边印着“KN95”，另一边印着“PM2.5”于是我去和商家沟通，要求退款不退货，商家坚持只能“七天无理由”退货退款。
On one side of the mask was printed "KN95" and on the other side was "PM2.5." So I went to the merchant and asked for a refund.
外面如此危险，而且我家的小区都封了，快递进不来，为了退假口罩，我还得浪费个真口罩？退货后商家再把假口罩卖给别人怎么办？在和淘宝客服反复沟通的过程中，我说我要打110举报了，商家干脆直接打来电话，对“三无”口罩的解释是：为了尽快满足广大消费者，商家来不及等工厂把标识印好就直接发货了，之后会在产品页上公告广大消费者。
In order to return the mask, I have to waste a real mask. In order to return the products, I will have to waste a real mask.
等了几天没等到商家的公告，再询问淘宝客服，客服发来“检验检测报告”，仍坚持他们卖的是正品。
Waiting for a few days did not wait for the announcement, and then asked Taobao customer service, customer service sent "inspection and testing report," still insist that they are selling authentic products.
让人疑惑的是，这家注册于大连的公司，生产厂家在安徽，拿的却是江苏的检测报告。
To our bewilderment, the Dalian-registered company, the manufacturer in Anhui Province, took Jiangsu's test report.
淘宝客服对此的解释是：“这是国家安排的，不是我们可以控制的。
Taobao customer service explained: "This is arranged by the state, not we can control.
”在我的反复质询下，商家退了款，但假口罩问题仍然让人担心：如果别人买到了怎么办？我决定走淘宝、天猫投诉，因为淘宝在微博上承诺“会在第一时间展开调查和处理”。
After my repeated inquiries, businesses withdrew the money, but the mask issue still raises concerns: What if someone else buys it? I decided to go to Taobao and Tibby complained because Taobao promised on its microblog that it would "investigate and deal with it in the first place."
然而，天猫投诉客服根本没人接，淘宝的举报通道也没有效果。
However, the sky cat complains customer service does not answer at all, Taobao's report channel also does not have the effect.
我在淘宝上联系了其他给予差评的买家，其他人表示也举报了此商家但未得到淘宝回复。
I contacted other buyers for poor reviews on Taobao, while others said they also reported the business but did not get a reply.
商家提供的“权威证书”最后，我决定拨打12315。
Finally, I decided to dial 12315. This is the authoritative certificate provided by the merchant.
商家的手机号码显示的是天津，寄送地址显示的是“天津天津市西青区宣城市宣州工业园区”。
The mobile phone number of the merchant shows Tianjin, and the address is "Xuanzhou Industrial Park, Xicheng District, Tianjin Tianjin."
我先拨打了天津12315，天津说这个地方其实是在安徽宣州，此时我才注意到这个寄送地址的奇怪之处。
I dialed Tianjin 12315, and Tianjin said the place was actually in Xuanzhou, Anhui Province, when I noticed the curious address.
我又拨打了宣州的12315，但因为没有商家准确地址他们无法处理。
I dialed 12315 in Xuanzhou, but they couldn't process it because they didn't have an accurate address.
后来我从淘宝店铺的“企业资质”一栏获得了商家在大连的地址和电话，并拨打大连当地12315投诉。
Later, I got the merchant's address and telephone number in Dalian from the "enterprise qualification" column of Taobao store, and called Dalian local 12315 to complain.
因为自己不常接到电话，为了防止漏接，我向12315另外提供了家人的电话。
Since I didn't get many calls myself, I gave 12315 extra calls to my family in case of missing connections.
几天后，我并未接到12315打来的电话，相反接到了淘宝商家的电话。
A few days later, instead of a phone call from 12315, I got a call from a Taobao merchant.
奇怪的是，他们打的竟然是我留给12315的家人的电话。
Strangely enough, it was I who left the phone number to my 12315 family.
显然，我的信息被泄露了。
Apparently, my message was leaked.
我再次拨打12315询问情况，得到的回复竟然是因为我没要求保密，但对方表示，此事正在处理中。
I called 12315 again and received a reply because I did not request confidentiality, but the other side indicated that the matter was being addressed.
淘宝公布的部分不良商家我又拨打商家电话，商家也承认了是工商局给了他们我的电话，让他们和消费者沟通、道歉。
Taobao announced some of the bad businessmen I dialed business phone, businessmen also acknowledged that it was the Commerce and Industry Bureau gave them my phone, let them communicate with consumers, apologize.
商家态度挺好，承认口罩质量确实有点问题，仍坚持没有贩卖假口罩，同时商家说自己也在配合工商局的调查，还说给我发50元红包当“道歉费”，我当然是不要的。
The business attitude is good, admit the quality of the mask is indeed a problem, still insist that there is no selling fake masks, and merchants said they are also cooperating with the investigation of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and said give me a 50 yuan red envelope as an "apology fee," of course I don't.
那么接下来，就交给工商局处理，并等待12315的结果了。
Then, to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to deal with, and wait for the results of 12315.
清者自清，浊者自浊。
He who purges is turbid.
另外，我收到的“医用口罩一次性透气病菌鼻炎卫生无菌加厚三层口罩”虽不能判断真伪，但口罩本身非常薄、包装简单、与商品图不符。
In addition, I received the "medical mask disposable germ rhinitis sterile sterile three-layer mask" can not judge true or false, but the mask itself is very thin, simple packaging, and commodity map does not match.
因为“商品过期不存在”，我已经无法看到其他消费者的评论。
I can no longer see comments from other consumers because of the "expiration date."
我申请退款被拒绝，但几天后，商家自动将款项退回。
My application for a refund was rejected, but a few days later the merchant automatically returned the money.
打击假口罩自疫情爆发后，一罩难求，口罩问题层出不穷——销售商哄抬物价、生产商生产假冒伪劣产品。
Fighting False Mask Since the outbreak of the epidemic, a mask problem has emerged - sellers bid up prices and manufacturers produce fake and inferior products.
在浙江义乌就有这样的新闻。
There is such news in Yiwu, Zhejiang Province.
1月25日，多名网友举报义乌有数个作坊生产不合格口罩，作坊非无菌车间、工人不带口罩、不戴正规口罩、现场卫生环境糟糕，并爆料有700万只假3M口罩将流向市场。
On January 25, several netizens reported that several workshops in Yiwu were producing unqualified masks, that workshops were not sterile, that workers were not wearing masks, that they were not wearing proper masks, that the sanitary conditions on the ground were poor and that 7 million fake 3M masks were expected to go on the market.
1月26日，执法人员现场查获“清轻”牌一次性口罩70箱，总计10万余只，无标识口罩11箱，共计5万余只。
On January 26, law enforcement officials seized 70 cases of "light" disposable masks, totaling more than 100,000, and 11 cases of unmarked masks, totaling more than 50,000.
执法人员在另一处举报地点虽未发现生产作坊，但在待寄包裹中找到“康溪”牌KN95口罩45个。
Law enforcement officers found no production workshops at another reporting location, but 45 KN95 "Konxi" masks were found in pending parcels.
1月27日义乌市公安局的通报，义乌一伙人因为涉嫌销售伪劣产品罪被警方依法刑拘。
January 27, Yiwu Public Security Bureau reported that Yiwu group suspected of selling fake and inferior products were arrested by the police in accordance with the law.
我默默拿出我收到的KN95口罩比对了一下，口罩长相和视频中的义乌假口罩非常相似。
I silently took out the KN95 mask I received and compared it to the one I had seen in the video.
Play网传视频中，义乌小作坊正在生产不合格口罩不只义乌，全国各地都在严查假冒伪劣口罩。
Play video transmission, Yiwu small workshop is producing unqualified masks not only Yiwu, all over the country under strict inspection fake and shoddy masks.
截至2月4日，佛山警方查获了一个正在生产假冒名牌口罩的地下工厂，查扣17.5万余个假口罩；湖南长沙在三起案件中总共查处197万只假冒“飘安”口罩，其中有106万只口罩还是由某家具有二类医疗器械销售资质的商家经销，这些口罩几乎已经全部流入市场；黑龙江共查扣伪劣口罩2万余个、过期医用手套5万副；北京查获2万多只假冒3M口罩；石家庄查扣“昱卓” “源美” “小狮子瑞恩”等成品口罩5万余只；宁夏查获假冒“飘安”5万余只，其他还有假冒3M口罩、其他伪劣N95口罩和假冒橡胶手套若干；江都破获一个制假团伙，共查获22万余个假冒3M口罩。
As of February 4, Foshan police seized an underground factory producing fake name-brand masks, and seized more than 175,000 fake masks. Changsha, Hunan Province, seized more than 1.97 million fake ones in three cases, nearly all of which were exported to the market.
深圳一家在松岗街道东方工业二路283号一药店内，警方查获了来源不明、口罩上有明显污渍的口罩……除了本地产制的假冒伪劣口罩，还有国外流入的不合格口罩，凡此种种，让人防不胜防。
At a pharmacy at 283 East Industrial Road, Songgang Street, Shenzhen, police found unidentified sources of face masks with obvious stains... in addition to the real estate fake mask, and foreign inflow of unqualified masks, people can not prevent.
也在此提醒消费者，买口罩的时候不要盲目囤货，千万要当心选购。
Also remind consumers here, when buying masks do not blindly hoard goods, must be careful to buy.
友情考验只有商家在卖假口罩？错了。
Friendship test only business is selling false mask? Wrong.
微信朋友圈也在这次疫情中考验人性。
The micro-faith circle of friends also tested humanity in the epidemic.
朋友S告诉我，她在朋友圈看到有人在卖N95口罩，22元一个，保证正品，只发湖南省。
My friend S. told me that she saw someone selling N95 masks in a circle of friends, 22 yuan a year, guarantee authentic products, only in Hunan Province.
对方还是旅游博主。
The other party is still a tourist blogger.
从图片上来看，散装口罩上印着N95字样，而且口罩长得很像一片卫生巾。
From the picture, the bulk mask is printed with the word N95 and looks like a sanitary towel.
对方声称，特殊时期为了赶工，因此没有独立包装。
The other party claimed that the special period to catch up with the work, therefore no independent packaging.
朋友S和他理论，对方回答：“我卖这个并不是自己赚钱，是为救自己的公司，我们是本地城市电商，长沙属于疫情重灾区，我们公司业务基本凉凉，是让公司解散员工失业还是想办法做点其他的赚点钱把公司撑过去了，孰轻孰重，我心里自有安排！”朋友S说要举报，对方就直接把他删了。
"Friends S and his theory, the other side replied:" I do not sell this to make money, to save their own company, we are the local urban electricity business, Changsha is a serious epidemic disaster areas, our business is basically cool, let the company dissolve employees or find other ways to earn money to prop up the company!
朋友圈中售卖的长得像一片卫生巾的假口罩后来我在朋友圈也陆续看到有人卖口罩，其中还有一些国外口罩，作为普通消费者，实在真假难辨，价格在20到25元一个。
Friends of the sale of a mask like a sanitary towel-like mask later in the circle of friends I also see people selling masks, including some foreign masks, as ordinary consumers, really hard to distinguish, the price of 20 to 25 yuan.
如果真的遇到卖假口罩发国难财的，微信也有小程序“腾讯110”可以举报。
If encountering the country that sells false mask really hard money, micro-letter also has a small procedure "Tencent 110" can report.
口罩原本就是用来保护我们的，但却有人趁机发起了国难财，这种行为实在可耻。
The mask was designed to protect us, but someone took advantage of the opportunity to launch a national wealth, this behavior is shameful.
而比高价口罩更气人的，是贩卖假冒伪劣口罩，因为这是在害人。
And more irritating than high-priced masks, is selling fake masks, because this is harmful.
人可以不善良，但不能无耻。
A man may not be good, but he cannot be shameless.
现在包括微信、淘宝、12315、市场监管部门等很多渠道都可以举报假口罩，也许有些举报效果并不理想，但消费者仍可以通过多种渠道去举报、监督、跟进。
Now many channels, including micro-letters, Taobao, 12315, market regulator and so on can report false masks, some may not be ideal, but consumers can still report, monitor and follow up through a variety of channels.
杜绝假口罩的贩售，是在保护自己和他人。
Stop selling fake masks to protect yourself and others.
当然，也希望各大平台和渠道都可以积极响应消费者投诉、加大打击力度。
Of course, also hope that the major platforms and channels can respond positively to consumer complaints, strengthen the fight.
