目前，韩国近九成（87.4%）确诊病例集中在大邱和庆北这两个相邻地区，分别有两个主要的传染发生地：新天地大邱教会和庆北清道郡大南医院。
Currently, nearly 90% (87.4%) of the confirmed cases in Korea are concentrated in the neighboring areas of Daegu and Gyeongbei, where two major infections occur: Taegu Church in Xintiandi and Daonan Hospital in Qingdao County in Gyeongbei Province.

韩国中央灾难安全对策本部第一总括协调官金刚立29日已表示，预计本周末将是疫情是否会进一步升级的关键时刻，呼吁民众尽量避免外出，暂停参与宗教活动和集会等聚集性活动。
Kim Gang-li, the first umbrella coordinator of the central disaster security response headquarters, said Wednesday that he expected the weekend to be a critical time for further escalation of the epidemic, calling on people to avoid going out and suspending their participation in gatherings such as religious activities and gatherings.
但他也指出，前往筛查诊所接受检测的大邱市民被确诊的比例远远低于新天地信徒。
But he also noted that the proportion of Taegu residents diagnosed at screening clinics was far lower than that of Xintiandi believers.
据韩国外交部3月1日消息，截至当天上午5时，因疫情针对韩国采取入境管制措施的国家和地区增至78个。
As of 5: 00 a.m. on the same day, the number of countries and territories taking immigration control measures against the Republic of Korea had increased to 78, the Foreign Ministry said.

Thirty-five countries and regions around the world have imposed comprehensive or partial entry bans on South Korea, two more than on the previous day.
加大对从韩国入境人员的检疫力度的国家和地区则从前一天的42个增至43个。
The number of countries and regions stepping up quarantine efforts on people entering South Korea rose to 43 from 42 the day before.
尽管国内疫情形势严峻，但截至目前韩国尚未因此在食材供应方面出现问题。
Although the domestic situation is serious, but so far South Korea has not caused problems in the supply of food materials.
据韩联社1日报道，这可能与韩国餐饮业2019年第四季度采购的大部分蔬菜和肉类的国产比重高于自华进口比重有关。
This may have something to do with the fact that most vegetables and meat purchased by the Korean restaurant industry in the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher than the proportion of imports from China, the agency said Wednesday.
据韩国农业观测本部26日发布的数据，在调查的330家餐厅所使用的13种蔬菜中，有11种韩国出产比例高于中国，白菜、萝卜、大葱、卷心菜的国产比例超过90%。
Of the 330 restaurants surveyed, 11 produce more vegetables in South Korea than in China, with Chinese cabbage, radish, scallion and cabbage accounting for more than 90 percent, according to data released by the Korea Agricultural Observation Headquarters on the 26th.
仅有剥皮洋葱和辣白菜的中国产比例分别达到87.4%和55%，但35.5%采购中国产辣白菜的餐厅预测中国产比例将逐步降低，比认为比例将升高的餐厅（30.7%）多。
Only peeled onions and Chinese cabbage produce 87.4 percent and 55 percent, respectively, but 35.5 percent of Chinese-made cabbage restaurants predict a gradual decline in Chinese production, more than the 30.7 percent that believe will rise.
肉类方面，这些餐厅除牛肉以外的绝大部分畜产品的国产比例超过70%，猪肉、鸡肉、鸭肉的比例分别达到66.9%、85.8%、96.7%。
With regard to meat, the proportion of meat produced in these restaurants exceeds 70 per cent, with pork, chicken and duck accounting for 66.9 per cent, 85.8 per cent and 96.7 per cent respectively.
韩国农林畜产食品部表示，尽管中国正受疫情影响，但农副产品总体上仍然货源充足，供应稳定。
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock and Food said that although China was suffering from the epidemic, agricultural and sideline products were still well supplied and stable.
业内人士表示，原产地追溯制度扎根后，餐厅的国产食材采购比例变高，但若疫情持续较久，辣白菜以外品类的供应可能因此受到影响。
Industry sources said that when the traceability system took root, the proportion of domestically produced food items in restaurants became higher, but if the epidemic persisted for a long time, the availability of items other than cabbage might be affected.
