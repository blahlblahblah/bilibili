Respondents for Beijing News reporter Zhou Xiaoqi, editor, collate & # 160; Chen Xiaoshu, proofread by & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
发文者是武汉市中心医院（后湖院区）疼痛科的主任蔡毅，他讲述了一线护士被感染的经历，呼吁大家做好自我隔离，不要辜负医者眼泪。
The author, Cai Yi, director of the pain department at Wuhan Central Hospital (Houhu District), described the experience of front-line nurses being infected and urged people to isolate themselves and live up to their tears.
他们所在的医院是距离华南海鲜市场最近的三甲医院，也是最早收治新型冠状病毒患者的医院之一。
Their hospital is the nearest Sanjia hospital to the South China seafood market and one of the first hospitals to treat patients with the new coronavirus.
在1月22日，医院被征用为第二批定点医院后，蔡毅和被感染的护士便主动报名，要求支援前线。
On January 22, after the hospital was requisitioned as the second batch of designated hospitals, Cai and the infected nurses volunteered to sign up for the front line.
护士的感染让蔡毅难过。
Cai Yi was upset by the nurse's infection.
但战斗还在继续，“我们怕了、退了，武汉怎么办？”“不仅要给患者治疗，还要防范身边可能被感染的战友”剥洋葱：你在朋友圈写道，科室有护士感染了，经过大概是怎样的？蔡毅：感染的护士和我都是1月23日第一批报名上前线的，也是同一天进病房。
But the battle continues, "We're afraid, we're back, what about Wuhan?" "Not only to treat the sick, but also to guard against fellow soldiers who might be infected" Peeling onions: You wrote in your circle of friends that the nurses in the department were infected, what might have happened.Cai: The infected nurses and I were among the first to sign up for the hospital on January 23
我们每天都很辛苦，八到十个小时工作，护士跟患者的接触比我们要更多。
We work hard every day, 8 to 10 hours, and nurses have more contact with patients than we do.
前天我突然接到她的电话，电话那边她在哭，说自己被感染了。
The day before yesterday, I got a phone call from her. She was crying and saying she was infected.
我赶过去看了她刚拍的CT，上面有一块熟悉的肺部白块，我一下子不知道怎样才能安慰她。
I hastened to see the CT she had just taken. There was a familiar white lung lump on it, and I didn't know how to comfort her.
剥洋葱：她现在的情况怎么样？蔡毅：她现在自己在家里隔离，吃一些抗病毒的药，但是效果不太好，我在考虑把她收治入院。
How is she doing now? Cai: She's now isolated at home, taking some antiviral drugs, but it's not working. I'm thinking about hospitalizing her.
她的父母都去查了CT，父亲的肺部也显示有感染，所以可能也会把她爸爸收进来。
Her parents went to a CT scan, and her father's lungs showed signs of infection, so she might have taken in her father, too.
剥洋葱：得知她感染的消息之后，你们同事的反应如何？蔡毅：有的同事知道了，就开始绕开她走。
How did your co-workers react to the news of her infection? Cai: Some colleagues knew it and started to bypass her.
其实按规定，我也应该绕开的，但我做不到。
In fact, the rules, I should also be circumvented, but I can not.
她说她家里还有父母，害怕感染，想自己租房子隔离，我就加了层口罩，陪她去我们集中住的如家酒店退房，然后背着她向组织报告了，请他们安排给她的住所消毒。
She said her family also had parents, afraid of infection, wanted to rent their own house isolation, I added a mask, accompanied her to our concentrated hotel check out, and then reported to the organization behind her back, asking them to arrange for the disinfection of her residence.
按原则，接触了她，应该是要进行14天隔离的，但没有办法，毕竟我们手下还有32名患者。
In principle, she was supposed to be quarantined for 14 days, but there was nothing we could do. After all, we still had 32 patients.
这段时间我一直在给同事们打气，鼓励他们，我们不仅要给患者治疗，还要时刻防范身边可能被感染的战友。
All this time I've been encouraging my colleagues not only to treat their patients, but also to keep an eye out for those around us who might be infected.
防护装备数量足够、质量欠缺剥洋葱：你现在每天的工作是怎样的？蔡毅：我是疼痛科主任，要管我们科室负责的这个病区，负责病人的诊疗全程，收治病人、开药等等，每天早晚都要去查房，上班时间加一起大概是十个小时。
How much is your job now.Cai: I'm the director of the pain department.I'm in charge of the department in charge of the diseased area, responsible for the patient's diagnosis and treatment, receiving patients, prescribing medicine, etc., every morning and every night, the working time is about ten hours.
剥洋葱：你们病区整体的情况怎么样？蔡毅：我们病区是发热二区，总共是32名患者，大多数年纪都在40岁以上，轻症、重症、危重都有。
Onion peeling: What's the overall condition of your diseaseCai: Our sick area is Fever 2, with a total of 32 patients, mostly over 40 years of age.
从硬件方面来看，这个病区以前是肿瘤科的病房，有单人间也有双人间，临时用来收治传染病患者之后，进行了一些改建，但是肯定没办法一下子就达到严格的隔离病房标准。
Hardware, the area used to be an oncology ward, with single rooms and double rooms, and was temporarily used to treat patients with infectious diseases.
从人员来看，我们还是比较充足的，我们疼痛科的医护人员都过来了，医生有12个，护士30个，所以还能实现正常的排班，按各自的体力条件来，不会让谁超负荷工作。
From the personnel point of view, we are still more adequate, our pain department medical staff came, 12 doctors, 30 nurses, so can achieve normal scheduling, according to their physical conditions, do not let who overload work.
蔡毅和他的团队身着防护服在工作。
Cai Yi and his team are working in protective clothing.
受访者供图剥洋葱：物资也都能保障吧？蔡毅：防护装备的数量还是能满足的，但符合质量要求的比较欠缺。
The interviewee tried to peel the onion: materials can also guarantee? Cai Yi: The quantity of protective equipment can still be satisfied, but the quality requirements are not satisfied.
平时有好的就用好的，没有好的，我们就把两件没那么好的凑在一起，尽量增强保护。
Usually good use good, no good, we put two not so good together, as much as possible to enhance the protection.
我们也向社会发起了物资捐赠的公告，大家都非常积极，有位市民在疫情暴发之前准备好了20个N95口罩，知道我要上一线，他送了我10个，跟我说“我们平时不怎么出门，你们医护人员更用得上”。
We have also launched a public announcement of material donations, we are very positive, one of the public before the outbreak of the outbreak prepared 20 N95 masks, he gave me 10, told me, "we do not usually go out, you medical personnel need more."
现在如果能多一点N95口罩、给我们医院捐赠一些无创呼吸机，就更加好了。
Now it would be even better if we could get a little more N95 masks and donate some non-invasive respirators to our hospital.
“为了不麻烦我们，患者不忍去按呼叫铃”剥洋葱：在这段时间的工作中，碰到了哪些问题？蔡毅：1月27日晚上是我第一次值班，我们病区也刚刚开放，进病房没几个小时，病人就已经住满了，当时真的心理上和身体上都没有做好准备。
In order not to trouble us, the patient couldn't bear to press the call bell to peel onions: What problems did I encounter during this timeCai Yi: The night of January 27th was my first duty and our sick area had just opened.
因为一切都是陌生的，陌生的患者、陌生的疾病、陌生的环境。
Because everything is strange, strange patients, strange diseases, unfamiliar environment.
逐渐适应以后，我发现最关键的问题还是疾病本身。
As I get used to it, I find that the most critical problem is the disease itself.
这个病毒比较难以掌控，潜伏期会传染，容易让人掉以轻心，而患者每天的病情变化也很快，可能今天还是轻症，明天就会加重，尤其是对那些有基础疾病的、年纪比较大的老人来说，风险很高。
The virus is more difficult to control, the incubation period can be contagious, easy to take lightly, and the patient's daily changes are also very rapid, probably mild today, and will worsen tomorrow, especially for older people with underlying diseases.
再有就是穿着防护服工作，有很多不便，防护镜常常会起雾，人站在几米之外我们就看不清了，交流只能靠扯着嗓子喊，也给我们和患者沟通带来了一些困难。
Then there is the work of wearing protective clothing, there are many inconveniences, protective goggles will often be foggy, people stand a few meters away from us can not see, communication can only rely on shouting, and we and the patient communication brought some difficulties.
不过协和医院的杨东教授教了我一招，加上患者、家属的微信，把他们拉进不同的小群、分组管理，这样我们就能随时沟通了。
But Professor Yang Dong from Concorde Hospital taught me to use a combination of letters from patients and family members, pulling them into small groups and managing them in groups so that we could communicate all the time.
剥洋葱：患者对你们的态度如何？蔡毅：这32名患者给予了我们最大的支持，谅解，我很感谢他们。
Onion peeling: What's the patient's attitude toward you? Cai: These 32 patients have given us our greatest support, understanding, and I really appreciate them.
甚至为了不麻烦我们，忍受着疾病带来的不适和恐惧。
Even in order not to trouble us, bear the discomfort and fear of disease.
很多症状，都是我们问出来的，没去查房的时候，即使喘息，他们都忍着不说，不去按呼叫铃。
Many of the symptoms, we asked out, did not go to the house, even when panting, they endure not to say, not to call the bell.
因为他们怕我们累，怕传染我们。
Because they're afraid of us getting tired, of infecting us.
剥洋葱：有没有让你印象比较深刻的患者？蔡毅：今天上午，我对一名危重的男患者进行了抢救，他今年60多岁。
Are there any patients who impress you? Cai Yi: This morning, I rescued a critically ill man in his sixties.
我记得接管病区那天，他是自己一个人开着车来看病的，进病房隔离治疗之后就一直把车停在医院附近。
I remember the day he drove his own car to see the doctor on the day of the takeover and parked his car near the hospital after isolation treatment.
他本身有合并心肺功能不全，来的时候就已经是呼吸衰竭了，在病房住了快一周，上午病情危重，尽管经过抢救，还是没挺过来。
He himself had combined cardiopulmonary dysfunction, had respiratory failure by the time he arrived, had been in the ward for nearly a week, and had been critically ill in the morning, although he had survived the rescue.
他去世之后，殡仪馆的车就过来把他的遗体直接拉去火化了。
When he died, the undertaker's car came over and took his body and cremated it.
他的儿子还在美国，老伴和弟弟赶来也没能见到最后一面，哭得不成样子。
His son was still in the United States, and his wife and brother had not been able to see the last of them, and had wept bitterly.
后来我帮他把车开回家，进行消毒。
Then I helped him drive home and disinfect it.
这个病人真的让我觉得很遗憾。
I'm really sorry about this patient.
“只想对得起身上这件‘白皮’”剥洋葱：从什么时候开始，你意识到了这次疫情的严重性？蔡毅：我们医院是离华南海鲜市场最近的医院，最早在去年12月底就收治了患者。
When did you realize the seriousness of the outbreak? Cai Yi: Our hospital is the closest hospital to the seafood market in South China, having admitted patients as early as the end of December last year.
但医院其他科室，尤其我所在的外科，对这个情况并不是很清楚，整个医院太大了，好几千名工作人员。
But the rest of the hospital, especially my own surgery, wasn't very clear about the situation. The hospital was too big, with thousands of staff.
1月初，我看到有人说这个病毒类似非典，也有同事开始出现肺炎相关的症状，但冬天本身就是病毒性感冒流行的季节，大家都没太把它当回事。
In early January, I saw people saying the virus was similar to SARS, and colleagues were beginning to develop pneumonia-related symptoms, but winter itself was the season for viral colds, and they didn't take it seriously.
所以大多数人也是到1月20日，钟南山院士在电视里讲，这个病毒可以人传人，我们才发现，它的传染性可能很强。
So most people are also on January 20th, Academician Zhong Nan Shan told television that the virus can be passed from person to person, we found that it may be very infectious.
剥洋葱：你是一名外科医生，在此之前有过救治传染病患者的经历吗？蔡毅：没有，非典的时候，我还在医学院上学。
Did you have any experience in treating infectious diseases before you were a surgeon? Cai Yi: No, I was still in medical school when SARS was here.
但这一次，医院在1月23日下外科动员令的时候，我很主动就报了名。
But this time, the hospital in January 23 under the surgical mobilization order, I volunteered to sign up.
剥洋葱：报名后是什么感想？ 蔡毅：医生也会怕，但这个时候只有互相鼓励、迎难而上，我们怕了、退了，武汉怎么办？我跟我们科室的人说，医生一辈子不碰一次疫情，就像是当了兵，一辈子没有扛过枪那么郁闷。
Tsai: The doctor will be afraid, but at this time, we have to encourage each other, to meet difficulties, we fear, retreat, Wuhan What? I told our office people, doctors do not touch an outbreak of disease once in a lifetime, just like a soldier who has not carried a gun all his life.
我们只想对得起身上的这件“白皮”。
We just want to live up to this "white skin".
