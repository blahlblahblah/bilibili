正在“休市”中的华南海鲜市场。
South China Seafood Market in "Rest Day."
记者：杨舒鸿吉“ 疫情爆发至今51天，位于武汉市疫情一级防控区域的万科下属三个小区，正静待“拐点”到来。
Reporter: Yang Shuhongji "outbreak so far 51 days, located in Wuhan city epidemic prevention and control area under the Wanke sub-division, waiting for the" inflection point "to come.
”郑宗保说，他已经快30天没与妻儿见面了。
Zheng Zongbao said he had not seen his wife and children for nearly 30 days.
这是他做物业经理13年来的头一次。
It was the first time in 13 years that he had been a property manager.
连续51天的不间断高强度工作，在他职业生涯中也是不多见的。
His 51 days of uninterrupted hard work have been rare in his career.
往年的除夕夜，他都会在负责的小区里巡查一番安保情况，然后回到家和家人吃上一顿年夜饭，看看春晚。
On New Year's Eve, he would patrol the neighborhood for security, then go home and have a New Year's Eve dinner with his family and see the Spring Festival Gala.
但是庚子年春节，这样的惯例因为一场新冠疫情落了空。
But in the Gengzi Spring Festival, the practice fell due to a new crown outbreak.
1月22日武汉封城前夕，郑宗保的家人回荆州老家过年。
January 22, Wuhan on the eve of the closure, Zheng Zongbao's family back home Jingzhou New Year.
“即使家人选择留守武汉，我下班后也不敢回家。
"Even if my family chose to stay in Wuhan, I dare not go home after work.
”他工作的地方与此次疫情最早的集中发生地--华南海鲜市场仅一墙之隔。
He works just one wall away from the South China seafood market, where the epidemic's earliest concentration took place.
郑宗保是武汉万科物业汉口区域经理，是这家地产公司在该区域6个小区的物业总负责人。
Zheng Zongbao is Wuhan Wanke Property Hankou Regional Manager, is the real estate company in the region of the six property chief.
其中，他管辖的万科汉口传奇、唐樾、悦庭三小区，因比邻华南海鲜市场，被武汉市列为疫情一级管控区域。
Among them, he jurisdiction Wanke Hankou legend, Tang Yingting, because of the neighborhood of the South China seafood market, Wuhan City as the first-level epidemic control area.
实际上，疫情爆发之前，华南海鲜城这座超级市场的危险，在小区业主眼里也是随处可见的。
Indeed, before the outbreak of the outbreak, the dangers of the supermarket in Hai Xian City, South China, were also visible to small district owners.
悦庭业主李冲表示，“华南海鲜市场里面充斥着腐臭的味道，烂菜叶子随处可见，污水横流，脚一踩进去，鞋子都会变黑。
"The South China seafood market is smelly," said Li Chong, owner of the Yue Court. "Ragged leaves can be found everywhere, sewage can flow, and shoes can turn black when one steps in.
业主曾多次投诉要求主管部门将市场搬迁，但均无下文。
Owners have repeatedly complained to the authorities about the relocation of the market, but no action has been taken.
”2019年12月底，华南海鲜市场发现“不明原因病毒”时，郑宗保提高了警惕，“因为小区内有不少就是华南海鲜市场租户，还有自如、蛋壳这类的合租公寓。
At the end of December 2019, when the South China seafood market discovered an "unidentified virus," Zheng Zongbao stepped up his vigilance, "because there are many tenants in the southern seafood market in South China, as well as freely shared apartments with egg shells and so on."
”资料显示，首批发病的新冠肺炎患者中，其中一人就租住在这里。
One of the first cases of new crown pneumonia has been reported, with one of the patients renting here.
这里是疫情的“核心地带”，小区则是“核心地带的CBD”，李冲这样描述当时的处境。
Here is the "core zone" of the epidemic, and the community is the "CBD of the heartland," Li Chong described the situation.
他庆幸疫情在后来的时间里并未在小区大规模流行。
He was glad that the epidemic did not spread to the community in the time that followed.
和李冲不同，郑宗保对于病毒的警觉，源于17年前他抗击非典时的记忆与经验。
Unlike Li Chong, Zheng Zongbao's vigilance against the virus stems from his memory and experience in fighting SARS 17 years ago.
彼时，郑宗保是一名在山东青岛服役的军人，“当时为了支援地方抗击疫情，我们的部队负责在道口参与执勤。
At the time, Zheng Zongbao was a soldier serving in Qingdao, Shandong. "Our troops were on duty at the crossroads to support the local fight against the epidemic.
”依照当时的经验，2019年的12月31日，“我们预计了最坏的结果，所以当时跟集团做了汇报，紧急采购了84消毒液，防尘口罩，以及一次性医用口罩，并启动了公共区域消毒工作，以及普及防控宣传措施。
Based on experience at the time, on December 31, 2019, "we anticipated the worst, so we reported to the group the urgent procurement of disinfectant 84, dust masks, and disposable medical masks, and started disinfecting public areas and popularizing prevention and control measures."
”郑宗保说。
"said Zheng.
物资采购到位后次日，横跨两个街区的华南海鲜市场宣布“休市”。
The day after the goods were procured, the South China seafood market, spanning two blocks, declared a "standstill".
但业主中很少有人警觉，极少有人出门戴上口罩，郑宗保回忆说，直到1月15日，医护人员被传染的消息在业主群内传播，才让华南海鲜市场的邻居们开始觉得危险。
But few owners were alert and few went out to wear masks. Zheng recalled that it was not until January 15 that news of the spread of the infection among owners began to make neighbors at the South China seafood market feel dangerous.
此后，业主们纷纷打电话询问物业疫情的情况，包括“小区内有没有确诊病例？疫情到底严不严重？”面对这些问题，郑宗保坦言，自己手上的信息也十分有限。
Since then, owners have called to ask about the property epidemic, including "Is there a confirmed case in the area? The epidemic is not serious?" Zheng confessed that he had limited information.
但他认为，已经持续了半个月的防控措施，为业主争取了时间。
But he believes the control measures, which have lasted for half a month, have bought time for the owners.
业主的紧张情绪很快传递到物业的职工群体中，“一位90后的前台小姑娘，家里人听闻她在华南海鲜市场附近小区上班后，每天打来三个视频电话询问身体情况，生怕她感染。
Tensions quickly spread to the property's workforce. "A 90-year-old receptionist was heard to call three video calls a day to ask about her health for fear of getting infected.
家人的担忧让小姑娘好几次落泪。
The worry of her family made the little girl cry several times.
”郑宗保说，“作为物业行业，我们的服务是不能间断的。
"As a property industry, our services are uninterrupted," said Mr Cheng.
在加强员工防护措施的同时，尽力确保项目不停摆。
While strengthening the staff's protective measures, try to ensure that the project does not stop.
”郑宗保正在进行小区消毒作业。
Zheng Zongbao is conducting a community disinfection operation.
1月23日、26日，武汉相继宣布关闭进出城通道，并在主要城区内对机动车禁行。
On January 23 and 26, Wuhan announced the closure of access roads and banned motor vehicles in major urban areas.
社区居民的紧张情绪迎来顶峰。
Tensions among the community peaked.
当时，物业“管家”杨杰的手机每天都处于被“打爆”的状态。
At the time, the property "housekeeper" Yang Jie's mobile phone every day in the "hit" state.
他需要每天拿着三个手机回应业主的询问，内容包括小区发病情况，以及疫情防控措施。
He has to carry three cell phones a day in response to inquiries from homeowners, including the incidence of disease in the community and measures to prevent and control the disease.
他坦言，向业主解释时，自己手头上的信息很有限。
He confessed that he had very limited information on hand to explain to the owners.
2月3日，郑宗保通过朋友圈，获悉小区内有一名业主被确诊。
On February 3, Zheng Zongbao through the circle of friends, learned that a small district owner was diagnosed.
同日，他也从社区那里拿到了确诊名单，并按社区要求，将确诊和疑似病例楼栋信息对业主进行公示，对小区采取封闭管理措施。
On the same day, he also received a list of confirmed cases from the community and, at the request of the community, published information on confirmed and suspected cases to owners and adopted closed management measures for the neighbourhood.
此外，物业也开始升级消杀强度：对小区公共区域进行2次全面消杀，对小区楼道每一层进行覆盖式消杀；在小区设置废弃口罩专用垃圾桶号召业主正确丢弃废弃口罩，降低病毒传播风险。
In addition, the property also began to upgrade the intensity of elimination: the community area to carry out 2 general elimination, each floor of the cell corridor covered elimination; set up a waste mask garbage bin in the community called on owners to correctly discard abandoned masks, reducing the risk of transmission of the virus.
李冲回忆，“那段时间，我一度认为专业消杀团队喷洒的消毒水，味道都是好闻的，能给人带来安全感。
'At that time, I used to think that the disinfectant sprayed by a professional antiseptic team had a good smell and gave people a sense of security, "he recalls.
”封城的措施让郑宗保可供调配的人手捉襟见肘。
The measures have left Mr Cheng with few resources to deploy.
他只能自己背上灌满消毒液的喷洒壶，穿上防护服对小区进行全覆盖的消毒。
He had to put on a disinfectant spray bottle on his back and put on protective clothing to disinfect the area.
“给小区消一次毒，需要半天时间，一天要消毒两次，是目前物业能做的，最繁重的工作。
"To eliminate a poison to the community, it takes half a day, a day to disinfect twice, is the current property can do, the most onerous work.
”他说。
'he said.
为了解决吃饭问题，郑宗保还在2月初骑着三轮车，找了三家煤气公司拖回10瓶液化气，保证了职工食堂的正常运作。
To solve the problem of food, Zheng Zongbao in early February on a tricycle, three gas companies towed back 10 bottles of liquefied gas, to ensure the normal operation of the staff canteen.
“通过公司协调，小区也找到了蔬菜供应商。
"Through corporate co-ordination, the community has also found vegetable suppliers.
蔬菜包一直保持不间断供应，包括一颗白菜，两个白萝卜以及4个土豆。
Vegetable packets, including a cabbage, two white turnips and four potatoes, have been continuously supplied.
”郑宗保说，“通过小程序下单，然后业主分批下楼领菜。
Zheng Zongbao said, "Order through a small procedure, and then the owner went downstairs to pick up the dishes.
”小区居民排队领菜。
Residents queued up for food.
受访者供图。
Supplied by respondents.
业主间隔两米以上的排队领菜的场景，让他觉得新奇又踏实。
The scene of the owner queuing more than two meters apart makes him feel novel and practical.
疫情之下，这座“风暴眼”里的社区在自救中找回往日的秩序。
Under the epidemic, the "eye of the storm" community in self-help to restore the old order.
“确诊病例、疑似患者已经在‘应收尽收’的政策出台后，被转移到专业机构接受治疗，最后一个发热门栋也在全封闭中，等待隔离期结束。
"Confirmed cases and suspected patients have been transferred to professional institutions for treatment after the policy of 'collect as much as possible', and the last hot door has been kept completely closed pending the end of the quarantine period.
”郑宗保表示。
Mr Cheng said.
如今的小区，因为全封闭显得安静，需要出小区的居民已经熟悉了体温枪、防护服，亦不排斥刺鼻的消毒水味道。
Today's neighborhoods, which are quiet because of their total closure, have become familiar with body temperature guns, protective clothing, and do not repel the acrid smell of disinfectant.
一位唐樾小区的居民告诉记者，他已经适应了这样的生活节奏。
One of the residents of the town of Tangyue told reporters that he had adapted to this rhythm of life.
李冲则开始憧憬疫情结束后的庆祝，到疫情过去时，真的很想出去大吃一顿，然后好好休息一天。
Li Chong began to look forward to the end of the celebration, by the end of the epidemic, really want to eat out, and then a good rest.
连续51天在小区坚守的郑宗保则告诉记者，每天晚上会在家人新建的平安群里汇报一天的情况，小区已经至少一个星期没有新增发热病人了，“曙光不远，希望在前。
Zheng Zongbao, who has been staying in his neighborhood for 51 days, told reporters that he would report every night in his family's newly-built peace camp, where there had been no new cases of fever for at least a week.
