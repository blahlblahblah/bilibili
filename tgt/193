”在湖北赤壁过年的陈庆选择了这样的过年方式。

而没能回到荆州老家、在北京一人过年的杨果则表示，以及已经叮嘱爸妈在家别出门，“等疫情散了后再团聚。
YangGuo, who has not returned to his hometown of Jingzhou and spent the New Year alone in Beijing, said he had told his parents not to go out at home.
”自武汉发端的新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情牵动着全国人民的心。
"The new-style coronavirus infection pneumonia from Wuhan has touched the hearts and minds of people across the country.
1月23日凌晨，武汉宣布疫情管控升级，自23日10时起，武汉市公共交通停运，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
In the early morning hours of January 23, Wuhan announced the escalation of the epidemic control, since 10: 00, Wuhan City, Wuhan public transport, the airport, railway stations from Han corridor temporarily closed.

武汉及周边城市的居民如何应对这场突如其来的疫情？他们将如何度过这个春节？除夕这天，《棱镜》对话了四个来自武汉及周边城市的家庭，也第一时间云共享了他们的年夜饭。
Wuhan and surrounding cities how to cope with the sudden outbreak of the disease? How will they spend the Spring Festival? On New Year's Eve, Prism talked to four families from Wuhan and surrounding cities, and for the first time shared their New Year's Eve meal.
饭菜一如往常，但心境却各不一样。
The food was as usual, but the mood was different.
以下是他们的自述：快递优先，药店大姐说口罩绝不涨价讲述人：丽娜，两个孩子的母亲坐标：湖北武汉1月19日晚10点，大学同学发来问候，问我在武汉还好吗？我说还好，心里涌起一阵感激。
The following is their self-description: express priority, drugstore elder sister said the mask never increase in price Narrator: Lina, the mother of two children coordinates: Hubei Wuhan January 19 evening, sent greetings, asked me how I am in Wuhan? I said OK, a surge of gratitude.
当天下午，我照旧带着孩子去上培优课。
That afternoon, I took my kids to a Peerage class as usual.
培优班的孩子们毕业升学在即，仍在抓紧最后一个寒假冲刺学习。
The students of Pei You-ban are still learning from their last winter vacation, just as they graduate and continue their studies.
1月20日，孩子培优班最后一天课，我们戴口罩坚持上完课，做好放假学习计划和生活计划，准备过年。
January 20, the child Pei You class last day class, we insisted on wearing masks after class, a holiday study plan and life plan, ready for the New Year.
1月22日，疫情升级，我和先生戴上口罩分别去了超市、菜场和药店，买了各种蔬菜、主食、副食、饮料、水果、日用品以及医用口罩、板蓝根。
On January 22, the epidemic escalated, my husband and I put on masks and went to supermarkets, grocery stores and pharmacies to buy various vegetables, staple foods, snacks, beverages, fruits, household items and medical masks, Banlangen.
超市人有些多，但商品都齐备，没有发觉有缺货的状态，也没有出现抢购的情况。
Supermarket people are a little more, but all the goods are ready, did not notice that there is a shortage of goods, there is no rush.
本想多囤些货，但超市说春节会保障供应，我们就没买太多东西。
We wanted to hoard more goods, but the supermarket said the Spring Festival would guarantee supplies, so we didn't buy much.
1月23日一早，家人告知我武汉“封城”了。
Early on January 23, my family told me that Wuhan "closed the city."
我们想还是多储备些食品和用品，自觉做好长期在家隔离的准备。
We want to stock up on food and supplies, consciously preparing for long-term isolation at home.
社区的超市、药店和菜场都还井然有序地开业，早点摊、年货摊也照旧，年味渐浓，大家的生活似乎并未被这场疫情打乱。
The community's supermarkets, pharmacies and vegetable farms were open in an orderly fashion, and their early stalls and annual stalls were as old as ever, and their lives did not seem to have been disrupted by the epidemic.
药店大姐告诉我们，口罩绝不涨价，不发国难财，而且告知我们第二天早7点开门N95口罩应该能到货。
The drugstore sister told us that the mask would never be expensive, that it would be difficult for the country to get rich, and told us that N95 masks should be available by 7 a.m. the next morning.
顺丰快递发出通知节日期间持续运营。
Shun Fung Express gave notice of continued operation during the festival.
外地友人给我们寄了些营养食品，说现在发去武汉的药品等物资都会优先保证。
Friends from the outside world sent us some nutritious food, said that now sent to Wuhan medicine and other supplies will be a priority to ensure.
而且快递多数自提，避免人与人接触。
And express the majority of self-mention, avoid contact with people.
我想，即便疫情升级，快递没停还是非常重要的。
I think, even if the epidemic escalates, express delivery is still very important.
路上，大家都自觉戴好了口罩，日常生活跟往常没有什么不同。
On the way, we all consciously put on masks, daily life is no different than usual.
除夕这天，我们家已经备足了年货。
On New Year's Eve, our family had got enough New Year's Eve.
早上像往年一样贴春联，我们帮着妈妈准备饺子做年夜饭，孩子们完成学习后看看书又画画，爸爸坐在沙发上看电视，一家人和和乐乐，家人友人们也互致节日问候。
In the morning, as usual, we helped mother prepare dumplings for New Year's Eve dinner. The children finished their studies and read and drew pictures. Father sat on the sofa watching TV.
加油武汉，鼠年吉祥！丽娜家的年夜饭戴口罩曾被指“不尊重人”，所幸村里过年习俗取消了讲述人：李亚，兼职婚礼摄影师坐标：湖北孝感我业余时间做婚庆摄像，本地婚庆主持人、摄影师们拉了个交流群。
Wuhan, the Year of the Rat auspicious! Lena's dinner wearing masks have been accused of "disrespect for people," fortunately the village festival customs cancelled the narrator: Li, part-time wedding photographer coordinates: Hubei filial piety I do part-time wedding photography, local wedding hosts, photographers played a community.
最近，大家都在为病毒性肺炎的事情苦恼。
Recently, everyone has been worrying about the case of viral pneumonia.
武汉疫情引发全国关注，但其实周边县市的状况更让人忧心。
Wuhan epidemic caused national concern, but in fact the situation of surrounding counties and cities is more worrying.
武汉城市圈的覆盖很广，城际铁路和私家车的普及大大提高了人员流通效率，许多在武汉务工的人返乡过年。
Wuhan city circle coverage, the popularity of inter-city railways and private cars has greatly increased the efficiency of the circulation of people, many workers in Wuhan return home for the New Year.
我元旦后没多久就感冒了，所以更加注意，出门都戴口罩，但也受到了很多指责：参加朋友婚礼时被人指责“不尊重人”，接待来宾时还被要求“摘下来”。
I caught a cold a short time after New Year's Day, so I took more care and went out wearing masks. But I also got a lot of criticism for being "disrespectful" when attending a friend's wedding and being asked to "take it off" when receiving visitors.
此前，孝感一直没有确诊病例，身边很多朋友、亲戚都觉得不严重。
Previously, filial piety has not been confirmed cases, around many friends, relatives feel no serious.
举办婚礼的新人们也都觉得孝感情况没那么严重，另外距离婚礼举办只有几天了，不好意思再取消。
Wedding newlyweds also feel that filial piety is not so serious, and only a few days before the wedding, I am sorry to cancel it.
直到1月24日（除夕）下午四时，我接下的6个春节期间的婚礼摄像工作终于取消，长舒了一口气。
It was only on January 24th, at 4: 00 p.m., that I finally got a long sigh of relief that my wedding photography during the next six Spring Festival holidays had finally been cancelled.
但还有群友接的婚礼主持工作到现在还没取消：“你们摄像还能戴个口罩，我主持怎么戴？”1月23日，孝感也要求公共场合强制戴口罩，这才好一些。
But other wedding ceremonies have not yet been canceled: "You can still wear a mask, how do I wear it?" January 23, filial piety also requires public compulsory wearing of masks, which is better.
我今天出门采购的时候发现，超市里几乎都戴口罩了，而且蔬菜供应充足，价格平稳，土豆、萝卜、山药这些能存放的比较受青睐。
When I went shopping today, I found that the supermarket almost all wearing masks, and vegetables supply adequate, stable prices, potatoes, turnips, yam, these can be stored more favored.
今天，孝感首次报告有22例确诊病例。
Today, filial piety reports 22 confirmed cases for the first time.
下午，孝感也通知暂停辖内公共交通，离开孝感通道暂时关闭。
In the afternoon, filial piety is also notified to suspend the jurisdiction of public transport, leaving filial piety passageway temporarily closed.
更让我担心的是周边农村的情况。
What worries me most is the situation in the surrounding countryside.
相较互联网上热烈的讨论，周边农村的居民囿于文化水平限制对此次病毒性肺炎的严重性认知不足，更别说防护了。
Compared to the heated discussion on the Internet, the rural residents in the surrounding countryside are limited in their knowledge of the severity of viral pneumonia, let alone protection.
而且农村情面薄，不好意思取消拜年或戴口罩拜年。
And the rural situation is thin, sorry to cancel New Year call or wear masks.
腊月、正月还是农村婚嫁的高峰期，酒席多，人口聚集容易交叉感染。
Lunar, January or the peak of rural marriage, banquet, easy to cross-infection population aggregation.
城区的酒店已经接到通知，禁止承办聚会活动，但农村的红白喜事等群体活动都照办。
Hotels in urban areas have been notified of the ban on holding parties, but mass events such as the red and white festivities in rural areas have been followed.
真应该动用村头的大喇叭不断广播提醒大家，少聚众、少流动、少拜年，不要因为抹不开的面子，造成疫情进一步传播。
Really should use the village loudspeaker constantly broadcast to remind everyone, less gathering, less mobility, less New Year, not because of the face, cause further spread of the epidemic.
我家有远亲过世，习俗要求大年初一“办新香”，邀请亲朋好友吃饭。
My family has a distant relatives died, custom requires the New Year's Day "to do new incense," invited friends and relatives to dinner.
我建议取消，但长辈要求大年三十晚上必须回去，否则是不敬。
I suggest to cancel, but the elder asks New Year's Eve must go back, otherwise is disrespectful.
好在昨天开始村委派人上门，先是取消了十三玩龙灯的传统，又建议不办红白喜事，长辈这才同意不用回去。
Fortunately, the village began to appoint people to the door, first cancelled the tradition of 13 dragon lanterns, and advised not to do red and white, the elders agreed not to go back.
今天中午，湖北省启动重大突发公共卫生事件Ⅰ级响应，多种形式的公众聚会开始被叫停。
This noon, Hubei Province launched a major public health emergency I response, many forms of public gatherings began to be called off.
李亚家的年夜饭我带回来的口罩终于有人要了讲述人：陈庆，企业行政坐标：湖北武汉、赤壁我是武汉人，老公是湖北赤壁人，我们两人都在北京工作。
At last someone asked for the name of the mask I had brought home. Chen Qing, the administrative coordinates of the company: Hubei Wuhan, Chibi I am Wuhan, my husband is Hubei Chibi, we both work in Beijing.
去年12月31日武汉卫健委首次发布不明原因病毒性肺炎消息的时候，我就主张今年春节不回老家过年，但老公的家庭观念特别重，就是“下刀子”也得回去过年。
Last December 31, Wuhan Health Commission issued the first news of unknown causes of viral pneumonia, I advocated not to return home this Spring Festival, but my husband's family concept is particularly heavy, "knife" also had to go back to New Year.
期间妈妈也一直劝我，说现在没什么问题，回去不要紧。
During the mother has also been advising me that there is no problem now, it does not matter to go back.
1月20日下午，我们一家三口自驾回到武汉，往年都会在武汉待到除夕那天才回赤壁，但这次比较担心，当晚就回了。
January 20 afternoon, our family of three drove back to Wuhan, usually in Wuhan until New Year's Eve before returning to the red wall, but this time more worried, the night back.
1月20日晚上，钟南山院士接受央视采访时确定病毒会“人传人”，我特别后悔自己不够坚定。
January 20 evening, Zhong Nan Shan academician in an interview with CCTV confirmed that the virus will "person-to-person", I particularly regret their lack of firmness.
我一直关注病毒性肺炎的进展，在北京买了一箱N95口罩带回来，但当时根本没人要。
I've been following the progress of viral pneumonia and bought a case of N95 mask back in Beijing, but nobody wanted it at all.
同学聚会和闺蜜约饭我都推了，被大家笑话我“怂”。
I'm teased about my classmates' party and my girlfriend's dinner.
我发了很多关于病毒性肺炎的科普信息给亲戚、朋友，提醒他们不要去人员密集的地方，但大多数人都回我“冇得事”。
I sent a lot of popular science information about viral pneumonia to relatives, friends, to remind them not to go to crowded places, but most people back me "no problem."
1月21日，我和老公回到赤壁。
On January 21, my husband and I returned to Red Cliff.
当天，疫情升级，国家卫健委专家建议：现在能不到武汉去就不去，武汉人能不出来就不出来。
On the same day, the escalation of the epidemic, the National Health Commission experts: can not go to Wuhan can not go, Wuhan can not come out.
这时候大家才开始意识到问题的严重性。
By this time people began to realize the seriousness of the problem.
我打电话叮嘱妈妈不要出门，她告诉我哥哥已经来取口罩了。
I called and told my mother not to go out. She told me my brother had come for a mask.
不过，公婆家这边的工作更难做。
But the job on her side is more difficult.
公公去菜场买菜不戴口罩，话还不能说重了，我现在只能不让他出门。
Father-in-law to the vegetable market to buy vegetables do not wear masks, words can not say heavy, I can only let him out now.
从昨天（1月23日）起，村长天天来我家报到，咨询记录外来打工人员动向和目前状况，要每天排查每天汇报。
Since yesterday (23 January), the village chief has been reporting to my house every day to consult on the movements and current status of migrant workers and to check daily reports.
尽管之前找口罩、给大家科普病毒信息，但收效不大。
Although the previous look for masks, give everyone popular science virus information, but not very effective.
直到最近娘家和婆家周边不断有感染案例大家才重视起来。
Until recently, the family and mother-in-law around the continuous cases of infection before we pay attention to.
现在我的亲友们都已经戴上口罩。
Now my friends and relatives are wearing masks.
今天中午吃完年饭后也约好不串门，不出门打牌，并且商量好线上红包拜年就好。
This lunch after the New Year's dinner is not scheduled to visit the door, do not go out to play cards, and negotiate a good line red envelopes on the New Year.
陈庆家的年夜饭爸爸退掉了来看我的高铁票讲述人：杨果，文化传媒行业职员坐标：北京1月24日早上，爸爸退掉了从荆州来北京的高铁票，对我说：“吃好点。
Chen Qingjia's dinner father stepped down to see my high-speed train narrator: YangGuo, Cultural Media Industry staff coordinates: On the morning of January 24, my father quitted the high-speed train ticket from Jingzhou to Beijing and said to me, "Eat better.
”考虑到当前湖北省的疫情情况，爸爸决定响应号召，待在家里减少人群接触。
"Considering the current situation in Hubei province, my father decided to respond to the call to stay at home and reduce crowd contact.
这是我第一个在国内却没有回家过的春节。
This is the first Spring Festival that I haven't been home in China.
就在三天前，我还坚定地一定要回家过年，只不过往常都在武汉玩几天再回，这次准备直接回荆州不在武汉停留。
Just three days ago, I firmly decided to go home for the New Year, but usually played in Wuhan for a few days before returning, this time ready to go directly to Jingzhou not stop in Wuhan.
1月22日早上，荆州也出现了病毒肺炎确诊病例。
On the morning of January 22, there were also confirmed cases of viral pneumonia in Jingzhou.
许多朋友劝我：别回来了。
Many friends advised me not to come back.
中午时分，我终于决定退票，安心在北京待着。
At noon, I finally decided to return my ticket and stay in Beijing in peace.
但父母怎么也不能理解，“一家人在一起才算过年。
But parents do not understand, "the family together count New Year.
”爸爸决定来北京陪我过年。
"My father decided to come to Beijing for the New Year.
但形势变化太快了，1月23日凌晨，武汉通知开始关闭市内公共交通，离汉通道暂时关闭。
But things changed so fast that in the early hours of January 23, Wuhan notice began to close the city's public transport, Han corridor temporarily closed.
随后，黄冈、鄂州等地陆续开始宣布暂时关闭离开通道。
Subsequently, Huanggang, Huangzhou and other places began to announce the temporary closure of the exit channel.
随着确诊人数直线上升，于是出现了开头这一幕。
As the number of confirmed cases skyrocketed, the beginning of the scene began.
在武汉务工的其他亲人也决定留在武汉过年，年夜饭取消。
Wuhan workers in other relatives also decided to stay in Wuhan for the New Year, the New Year's dinner canceled.
没多久，荆州通知于1月24日中午开始关闭离开通道。
Not long after, Jingzhou informed that the exit corridor would be closed at noon on January 24.
我也一直关心着武汉和湖北疫情的发展，为医生上下班的住宿问题、病人的安置问题忧心，希望这些问题能尽快得到解决。
I have also been concerned about the development of the epidemic in Wuhan and Hubei. I am worried about the accommodation of doctors going to work and the resettlement of patients.
往年春节，我们都会一起去监利县的奶奶家吃年夜饭，一大家人热热闹闹。
Spring Festival in previous years, we will go to the county superintendent's grandmother's home to eat New Year's Eve dinner, a family bustle.
今年则各自在家。
This year they were at home.
除夕夜，我自己做了清炒菜心、山药排骨和蛋羹，这就是我的年夜饭。
On New Year's Eve, I made my own cooking heart, yam chop and egg soup, this is my New Year's dinner.
吃完了和家人微信送上祝福，叮嘱家人不要随便出门，然后安心看春晚。

虽然今年没能一起过年，但是平时还可以继续回去，爸妈也可以来看我。

就等疫情散了后再团聚呗。
