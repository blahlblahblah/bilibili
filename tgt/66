+ 12 / Enron Editing & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
春节前4天号召全员24小时待命，主动暂停旗下2000多家线下教育机构的线下运营；极限模拟公司未来成本支出和现金流；推动2000家线下学校向线上转型……，疫情发生十几天内，松鼠AI一直处于 “一级战备状态”。
Four days before the Spring Festival call for full 24-hour standby, the initiative to suspend its more than 2,000 offline educational institutions offline operations; limit simulation of the company's future costs and cash flow; to promote the offline transformation of 2,000 off-line schools.
“疫情期间，在公司收入会减少的情况下，我们要确保公司的现金流能让我们在两年内活下去”，松鼠AI创始人栗浩洋对《深网》说。
"We need to make sure the company's cash flow can keep us alive for two years in the face of declining company revenues," the founder of squirrel AI, Li Haoyang, told Deep Web.
松鼠AI前身乂学教育，创办于2014年。
Cloud AI, formerly known as Clue Education, was founded in 2014.
成立至今获得4轮融资，总额近10亿元。
It has received 4 rounds of financing so far, totaling nearly 1 billion yuan.
2018年6月，乂学教育推出“松鼠AI”品牌，以算法为核心，在K12教育领域推出人工智能自适应学习引擎。
In June 2018, Clue Education introduced the "squirrel AI" brand, with algorithm as the core, to introduce artificial intelligence adaptive learning engine in K12 education field.
2018年公司营收近10亿，2019年线下已开业教学中心近2000家。
In 2018, the company close to 1 billion revenue, 2019 line has opened almost 2,000 teaching centers.
以下为松鼠AI创始人栗浩洋自述，其讲述了在10多天的时间内，公司如何应对线下2000多家教育机构的暂停，如何核算公司现金流及保证员工安全等问题。
Here's LiHaoyang, founder of squirrel AI, who describes how the company responded to the suspension of more than 2,000 educational institutions online for more than 10 days, accounting for cash flow and staff safety.
全公司进入“一级战备状态”春节前4天，公司运营就进入一级战备状态，当时我在群里发了个消息，要求公司全员24小时待命，就连除夕那天，很多人都忙到大半夜。
Four days before the Spring Festival, the company went into operational readiness, when I sent a message in the group asking the company to maintain full 24-hour standby. Even on New Year's Eve, many people were busy till midnight.
在这4天里，我们的工作主要分为三部分。
During those four days, our work was divided into three main parts.
一是通知全国各地校长统一思想，为了孩子健康着想，主动停止线下授课，并督促校长们执行。
One is to inform principals around the country to unify ideas, for the sake of the health of children, actively stop off-line teaching, and urge principals to implement.
当时有些校长抱怨官方都还没有要求停课，我们为何要停？在我解释完潜伏期也可能感染之后，每个校长都同意停课，这让我很感动，因为停课就意味着损失。
Why did we stop after I explained that the incubation period could also infect me? I was moved by the fact that each principal agreed to suspend classes because to do so would mean to lose them.
二是培训老师，因为我们在全国有1万多名线下老师都没有经历线上教学，我们需要集中给这些老师培训如何在网上授课。
The second is to train teachers, because we have more than 10,000 offline teachers across the country who have not been taught online, and we need to focus on training these teachers on how to teach online.
三是动员所有员工回岗工作，一些老师刚开始没有危机意识，跟我吐槽自己刚开始度假，怎么就要原地工作了。
Third, to mobilize all staff back to work, some teachers just did not have the sense of crisis, and I vomit groove their own vacation, how to work in situ.
而且还有一些员工没带电脑，我们要集中解决公司员工远程工作遇到的各种问题。
And there are employees who don't have computers, and we need to focus on solving all the problems our employees have with telecommuting.
我跟一些有些抱怨的员工讲，在特殊时期，不及时调整公司的节奏，公司就会危险。
I told some grumbling employees that companies can be at risk if they don't adjust the pace of the company in a particular time.
所以我们必须改变平时的工作态度和速度。
So we have to change our attitude and speed.
可以说，每个员工工作状况和意识，就是公司未来生存状态的预期。
It can be said that each employee's work status and awareness, is the company's future state of survival expectations.
在公司的动员下，所有员工这十多天都保持“战备状态”，有一些程序员在老家远程办公，随时解决技术问题。
Under the company's mobilization, all employees have remained "war-ready" for more than a decade, with some programmers telecommuting at home, ready to solve technical problems.
因为微信电话会议有9个人的限制，我们就用QQ搭建视频会议。
Since there were nine people on the microphone conference call, we used QQ to build the videoconference.
从1月22日到2月3日，我们开的视频会议就有36场，公司员工8万人次听取视频直播培训。
From January 22 to February 3, we held 36 videoconferences, in which 80,000 employees received live video training.
制作了校长战备手册，员工战备手册，家长沟通手册和学生在线学习手册等。
Produced school principals' strategy manual, staff strategy manual, parent communication manual and student online learning manual, etc.
1月24日一早，我们就启动了线上教学培训。
Early in the morning of 24 January, we launched online teaching training.
当天下午15:30，初中数学教研员开始线上授课培训，当时有5518名老师在网上参加，没能参加的老师方便的时候也自觉观看回放。
At 15: 30 pm that day, junior high school math researchers began training online, when 5,518 teachers participated online, and teachers who could not attend consciously watched the playback when it was convenient for them.
之后，英语、语文等各个科目线上教学培训都有条不紊的展开。
Since then, English, Chinese and other subjects online teaching and training have been carried out methodically.
我们是线上线下、一体两翼，协同发展的，线下学生在学校也是通过电脑在智适应系统中跟着松鼠AI虚拟老师来学习。
We are online offline, integrated wings, coordinated development, online students in school is also through computers in the intellectual adaptation system to follow the squirrel AI virtual teacher to learn.
松鼠AI的AI在线学习班课和普通的直播课区别较大，直播是千人一面，而松鼠AI是智适应学习，例如找到90分学生那10%的知识漏洞，精准靶向学习。
Squirrel AI's AI online classes differ from ordinary live classes in that they are broadcast live on a thousand-person side, while squirrel AI is intellectually adaptable to learning, such as finding 90 percent of a student's 10 percent knowledge gap and being targeted for learning.
我们纯线上教学已经做了四五年了，相对有经验。
We have been teaching online for four or five years and are relatively experienced.
在推动线下学校往线上转化的过程中，虽然也出现过波折和忙乱，但这种波折还是我们能承受的住的。
In the process of promoting the online transformation of schools offline, although there have also been ups and downs and bustle, but this kind of ups and downs or we can afford to live.
禁止员工乘坐5人以上的交通工具返程1月31日，公司发了一个通知，将原来的返岗时间由2月9号改到2月15号。
On January 31, the company issued a notice changing the original time for returning to work from February 9 to February 15.
同时，公司规定，所有员工在2月15号之前不允许乘坐各种交通工具。
Meanwhile, the company rules that all employees will not be allowed to travel by all means until February 15.
因为我个人觉得返程中，交通工具可能是后面疫情发展的最大的隐患。
Because I personally think that on the return journey, transportation may be the greatest hidden danger behind the epidemic.
如果不是交通工具，这次疫情在国家严厉的控制及各界的努力下，疫情应该会下降。
Had it not been for the vehicles, the epidemic would have been reduced by the strict control of the State and the efforts of all sectors.
但这次春节返程的交通工具有可能造成交叉感染。
But the vehicles returning from the Spring Festival may cause cross-infection.
所以我们规定员工在15号之前不能返程，可以在家远程办公。
So we stipulate that employees cannot return before the 15th and can telecommute from home.
因为我们在北京、上海等全国各地都有办公地点，公司规定15号开始返程的员工，不允许坐5人以上的交通工具。
Because we have offices in Beijing, Shanghai and other parts of the country, the company rules that employees returning from the 15th will not be allowed to travel more than five people.
无论是自己开车或者租车都行。
Either drive or rent a car by yourself.
即便是带着口罩坐三轮车都比做公共交通工具安全些。
Even a tricycle wearing a mask is safer than public transport.
返程后，公司规定员工所有的活动和工作不能在办公室进行。
On return, the company stipulated that all employee activities and work could not be carried out in the office.
如果有员工需要当面沟通，我们要求每次员工沟通的人数不能超过4个人，而且必须带着口罩，各自相距一米在室外进行沟通。
If there are employees who need to communicate in person, we require that no more than four people communicate each time, and that they wear masks and communicate with each other one metre apart outside.
砍成本，核算现金流教育企业能否度过这关键的三四个月主要看账上的现金储备。
Cutting costs, accounting for cash flow Education companies can spend this crucial three or four months looking primarily at the cash reserves on their books.
很早之前我们就对公司进行压力测试，并在公司内部形成共识，任何时期公司的现金流都要永远保证公司两年的运营，假设有一年没有融资，那么后面一年，公司就要通过优化成本和提升收入效率再次保证公司有足够的现金流保证公司两年运营。
Long ago we tested the company's stress and formed a consensus within the company that its cash flow should be guaranteed for two years at any time. Assuming there is no financing for one year, the company will again have enough cash flow to keep the company going for two years by optimizing costs and increasing revenue efficiency.
现在在疫情的压力下，我们又重新对公司现金流进行了盘点。
Now under the pressure of the epidemic, we have re-inventory the company's cash flow.
在公司收入可能会大幅减少的情况下，我们必须节流，降低自己的运营成本。
With company revenues likely to fall sharply, we have to cut back and cut our operating costs.
把所有能砍掉的成本都砍掉了，例如之前已经进行了三分之一的新办公区的装修，付了定金的会议的支出，市场投放等，以保证我们在现有的现金流下能活两年。
Cut down all the costs that can be cut. For example, one-third of the new office space has already been renovated, a deposit has been paid for the meeting, the market has been put on the market, etc., to ensure that we can live two years with the cash flow we have.
我看到上海市公布延长社会保险缴费期及税收支持等帮扶政策，我们对度过难关就更有信心了。
I see that by announcing the extension of the social insurance contribution period and the tax support policy, Shanghai will have more confidence in overcoming difficulties.
在这里需要指出的是，疫情发生后，我们给湖北青少年基金会的300万捐款，及200万给受困在家没有设备的疫区学生购买电脑等设备、合作校捐助的500万现金及给疫区及全国用户捐赠价值5亿的学习账号等，这些都是我们必须要花的钱，不在我们核减成本之内，反而是在疫情期间增加的花费。
It should be noted that after the outbreak, we donated 3 million US dollars to the Hubei Youth Foundation and 2 million US dollars to purchase computers and other equipment for students in stranded and unequipped areas, 5 million cash donations from cooperative schools and 500 million study accounts to affected areas and national users.
给疫区及全国的孩子免费开通账户是因为，我们希望每个孩子们不要因为疫情中断学习，遗忘了之前的知识点，别把之前良好的学习习惯扔掉。
Free accounts for children in affected areas and across the country because we want every child not to stop learning because of the epidemic, forget about the previous knowledge, and not throw away the good old habits of learning.
希望他们能合理安排自己每天的学习、运动和娱乐。
I hope they can arrange their daily study, sports and entertainment.
把时间规划好，尤其是开学后不要跟不上学校上课的进度。
Plan your time well, especially if you can't keep up with your classes after school starts.
有人质疑教育公司免费公益是在引流获客，但是实际上公司常规引流课也是收费几百元的，并且只有16课时，这次全部免费并且90课时，这部分是真正的公益。
Some people doubt that educational companies give away free public goods, but in fact companies charge hundreds of yuan for routine drainage lessons, and only 16 hours, this time for free and 90 hours, which is a true public good.
此外，为了能让疫区的孩子“停课不停学”我们已经与湖北枝江英杰学校、宜昌英杰学校展开合作，保证孩子在家里按时上课。
In addition, in order to enable children in affected areas "non-stop learning" and Hubei Zhijiang Yingjie School, Yichang Yingjie School to ensure that children in the home on time.
前几天，这两所学校已经有实验班开课了。
A few days ago, experimental classes were held at the two schools.
此外，我们和湖北省十堰市第二中学、湖北省荆州市沙市区第一中学、湖北省鄂州市吴都中学的合作已经在对接和推进中。
In addition, we and Hubei Province Shiyan City No. 2 secondary school, Hubei Province Jingzhou City Sha Cheng Secondary School, Hubei Province Wu Du secondary school has been docking and advancing.
湖北公立学校部分学生可能在近期采用公司的智适应系统上课解决开学推迟的问题。
Some students in Hubei public schools may use the company's brain adaptation system in the near future to solve the problem of delayed start.
撑过三个月，教育公司将迎来爆发性增长现在线下分校面临的问题是，长时间不能开课，一些家长就会提出退费要求，如果现金储备不足，很可能遭遇现金流困难；二是暂停的这几个月，会面临房租、人员工资等固定成本的支出；三是这几个月可能没有新的招生收入。
Some parents will demand a refund if cash reserves are insufficient, and cash flow difficulties are likely. Second, there will be fixed costs such as rent, staff salaries and other expenses during the months of suspension. Third, there may be no new enrolments in these months.
三四个月之后，等到疫情过去，对我们反而是一个涅槃重生和高速发展的机会。
Three or four months later, when the epidemic is over, it will be an opportunity for us to rebirth and develop at a rapid pace.
所以我个人认为，每个教育企业一定要在这个时候稳住自己的现金流，只要度过这几个月的难关，将会迎来爆发性的增长。
So I personally think that every education company must stabilize their cash flow at this time, as long as the difficulties of the past few months, will usher in explosive growth.
而预计此次疫情结束后，教培市场的集中度会进一步提升。
It is expected that after the end of this epidemic, the concentration of the teaching market will further improve.
中小教培机构挺下去的两种途径线下中小型培训机构要想挺过这三个月，我觉得有两个方法。
Two Ways for Small and Medium-sized Training Institutions To survive these three months, I think there are two ways.
一是想办法解决现金流的问题，撑过这三个月。
One is to find a solution to the cash flow problem, over the past three months.
2003年非典时，俞敏洪老师创办的新东方就是靠着现金储备加上几千万借款度过了最艰难的时刻，后来迎来了爆发性的增长。
When SARS broke out in 2003, New Oriental, founded by Miss Yue Minhong, weathered its toughest times with cash reserves and tens of millions of dollars in loans.
二是赶快找大品牌的教育公司合作，一起转型线上，在目前的情况下，单个中小教育机构孤军奋战是很难生存下去的。
The second is to find large brands of education companies to work together, together with the transformation line, in the current circumstances, a single small and medium-sized educational institutions can hardly survive alone.
联合大品牌的教育公司往线上转型有三个好处。
There are three advantages to bringing big-name educational companies online.
一是，家长对大品牌的信任感普遍较强。
First, the parents of large brands of trust is generally strong.
有了家长的信任，家长就不会着急退学费了，家长的退费比例有可能从50%多降到10%，教培机构就能熬过第一关。
With parental trust, parents will not worry about school fees, the proportion of parents may be reduced from more than 50% to 10%, institutions will be able to survive the first pass.
第二，线下培训机转型线上后，在这三个月内才有可能消课，预交学费才能变成现金流，后面才有家长续费的可能性。
Second, after the transition line of the offline training machine, it is possible to cancel classes within three months, pay tuition fees in advance to become cash flow, only after the possibility of parental renewal.
否则即使家长没有集中退费，正规的教培机构也不能花这些预交学费，没有消课的学费不算公司的收入，这在业内是共识。
Otherwise, even if the parents do not have a centralized refund, the formal education and training institutions can not pay these fees in advance, no tuition fees do not take into account the income of the company, which is the consensus in the industry.
第三，在新招生方面，疫情的这几个月，并不意味着完全没有新招生的收入。
Third, when it comes to new admissions, these months of the epidemic do not mean that there is no new intake at all.
品牌机构的线上营销能力和经验本身更强，因为一些品牌机构在疫情期间赠送免费账号，如果家长和学生在这几个月内的学习体验特别好的，一些家长会选择疫情过后让孩子继续留在线上学习，还有一些家长会选择报名高附加值的课程。
Brands have greater online marketing capabilities and experience, because some branded organizations give free accounts during the epidemic, some parents choose to keep their children online after an epidemic, while others choose to sign up for higher value-added courses if parents and students have a particularly good learning experience during these months.
我预估在这三四个月中，能转到线上的家长重20%会在疫情后继续留在线上学习，80%的可能还会选择继续留在线下学习。
I estimate that in the next three to four months, 20 percent of parents who are able to switch to the Internet will continue to study online after the epidemic, and 80 percent will likely choose to stay offline.
所以我说撑过这三个月，线下教培机构也会迎来小阳春，带来爆发性的增长。
So I said that over the past three months, online training institutions will also usher in Xiaoyang spring, bringing explosive growth.
但从线下机构转线上，并不意味永久都是线上学习，我认为未来教培领域会是线下和线上融合。
But switching from offline to offline doesn't mean that learning is always on-line, and I think the future of coaching will be offline and online.
但与纯在线教育公司相比，有线下机构的教育公司有一个好处，那就是家长可以选择每个月定期来线下学校，根据孩子学情报告的数据分析，当面来解决线上解决不了的问题，所以线上和线下的结合在未来会是教育领域的一个潮流。
But educational companies with offline facilities have the advantage over pure online education companies that parents can choose to come to the off-line school regularly every month to face-to-face problems that cannot be solved online, based on data analysis in their children's reports, so the combination of online and offline education will be a trend in education in the future.
