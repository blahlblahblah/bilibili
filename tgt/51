据该医院肾病科医生王刚介绍，院区共有60名尿毒症患者，每人每周接受2-3次血液透析。
According to Wang Gang, a nephrologist at the hospital, there were 60 uremic patients in the hospital, each receiving hemodialysis two to three times a week.
据武汉市血液透析质量控制中心的数据，武汉市共有4719名透析患者。
According to Wuhan Hemodialysis Quality Control Center, there were 4719 dialysis patients in Wuhan.
而受到新冠肺炎疫情影响，多家医院的血透中心已经关闭。
However, due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak, the hemodialysis centers in several hospitals have been closed.
全文3677字，阅读约需7.5分钟1月30日上午，42岁的肖娟（化名）接到了武汉市市长热线的回电。
Xiao Juan (not her real name), 42, received a call back from the mayor's hotline in Wuhan on the morning of January 30.
电话里称，她可以到武汉市协和医院西院透析了。
On the phone, she said she could get dialysis at the Western Hospital of Wuhan Concorde Hospital.
协和医院西院原本要被征用为发热定点医院，包括血透中心在内的各科室、门诊全部关闭，但经济技术开发区的透析病人实在太多了，所以市里决定，协和西院的血透中心继续运营。
The Western Hospital of Concorde Hospital was to be requisitioned as a fever referral hospital. All departments and clinics, including the hemodialysis centre, were closed, but the number of dialysis patients in the economic and technological development zone was so large that the city decided that the hemodialysis centre at the Concorde West Hospital would continue to operate.
肖娟是一名尿毒症患者，血液透析是她赖以生存的治疗方式之一。
Xiao Juan is a uremic patient, hemodialysis is one of her survival treatment methods.
新冠肺炎疫情发生前，她长期在武汉市中医医院汉阳院区（下称“中医医院”）透析，但自1月27日起，中医医院被征用为24家发热病人收治医院之一，除发热门诊外，各科室门诊关停，血液透析中心也在关闭之列。
Before the outbreak, she spent a long time dialysis in the Hanyang Hospital of Wuhan Chinese Medicine Hospital, but since January 27, the hospital has been requisitioned as one of 24 hospitals for fever patients.
▲1月28日，被征用为定点医院后，中医医院血透中心空无一人。
On January 28, after being requisitioned as a designated hospital, the hemodialysis centre at the TCM Hospital was empty.
新京报记者 海阳 摄据该医院肾病科医生王刚介绍，院区共有60名尿毒症患者，每人每周接受2-3次血液透析。
According to Wang Gang, a nephrologist at the hospital, 60 patients with uremia receive hemodialysis two to three times a week.
据武汉市血液透析质量控制中心的数据，武汉市共有4719名透析患者。
According to Wuhan Hemodialysis Quality Control Center, there were 4719 dialysis patients in Wuhan.
而受到新冠肺炎疫情影响，多家医院的血透中心已经关闭。
However, due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak, the hemodialysis centers in several hospitals have been closed.
中医医院血透中心关闭后，患者们有的被分配到武汉市中医医院总部继续治疗；有的在积极寻找接纳自己的医院。
After the closure of the hemodialysis center at the TCM Hospital, some patients were assigned to Wuhan TCM Hospital Headquarters for further treatment, while others were actively seeking hospitals to admit them.
截至1月28日晚间，院区60名透析患者全部找到了接收医院。
As of the evening of 28 January, all 60 dialysis patients in the hospital district had been admitted to the hospital.
王刚称说，这是一项生命工程。
Wang Gang said that this is a life project.
━━━━━帮60名病人联络血透中心1月26日上午10点，中医医院血透中心护士长丁玲的透析病友群里发出一条通知，由于中医医院被征用为第三批发热病人定点救治医院，从第二天起血透中心关门。
--Helping 60 Patients Contact the Blood Transfusion Center At 10 a.m. on January 26, the dialysis patient group of Ding Ling, the head nurse of the hemodialysis centre of the Chinese Medical Hospital, closed the hemodialysis centre the next day as the hospital was requisitioned for the third batch of fever patients.
“我们打听了几个没被征用医院的透析室，都饱和了，看大家自己有没有路子联系一下。
"We asked about the dialysis rooms at several of the unrequisitioned hospitals and they were saturated to see if we could get in touch with each other ourselves.
”丁玲称。
"said Ding Ling.
中医医院肾病科医生王刚后来在群里向患者们致歉，希望大家理解医院的难处：医院肾病科马上就会全面接收新冠肺炎患者。
Wang Gang, a nephrologist at TCM Hospital, later apologized to the patients in the group, hoping to understand the hospital's difficulties: the nephrology department would soon be receiving full treatment for patients with pneumonia.
王刚和医生们是26日一早接到消息的，武汉市卫健委在通知里称，中医医院将被征用为发热定点医院。
Wang Gang and the doctors received the news early on the 26th, Wuhan City Health Commission said in the notice that the Chinese Medical Hospital will be requisitioned as a fever designated hospital.
依据湖北省卫健委消息，截至2020年1月30日24时，武汉市累计报告新冠肺炎病例2639例，死亡159例。
As of 2400 hours on January 30, 2020, 2,639 new cases of pneumonia and 159 deaths had been reported in Wuhan, according to Hubei Wei Jiancommittee.
为了应对疫情，武汉市决定分批征用24家综合医院，临时改造成专门收治发热病人的定点医院，使收治床位规模逐步达到约1万张。
In response to the epidemic, Wuhan decided to requisition 24 general hospitals in batches and temporarily transform them into designated hospitals for treating febrile patients, gradually increasing the number of beds to about 10,000.
接到通知后，汉阳区肾病科的医生们全都忙碌起来，帮科内的60名病人联系各医院的血透中心。
At the notification, doctors at the Nephrology Department in Hanyang District were all busy trying to help the 60 patients in Kone contact the hemodialysis centres in the hospitals.
他们先后找到了武汉市亚心总医院、汉阳医院、市中心医院、市第一医院，但各医院血透中心均表示没有空余床位。
They have found the Wuhan General Hospital, Hanyang Hospital, the city center hospital, the city first hospital, but the hospital blood transfusion center said there are no spare beds.
经过各方协调，最终有22名病人被转入位于汉口的武汉市中医医院总部，继续治疗。
As a result, 22 patients were transferred to the headquarters of Wuhan Chinese Medicine Hospital in Hankou for further treatment.
至于另外38名病人，医生们想到了私营医疗机构。
As for the other 38 patients, the doctors thought of private medical institutions.
最终，泰康同济(武汉)医院同意收治7名病人，一家私人开办的血液透析中心接收了14人。
Eventually, Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital agreed to treat seven patients and a privately run hemodialysis centre admitted 14 people.
▲1月28日晚，中医医院门诊大厅聚，患者们希望院方帮忙安排新的血透机构。
On the evening of January 28, patients in the outpatient lobby of the TCM Hospital asked for help in arranging a new blood transfusion facility.
新京报记者 海阳 摄在王刚看来，透析是一项生命工程，病人不透析就会没命。
According to Wang Gang, a reporter for the Beijing News, dialysis is a life project and patients will die without dialysis.
“我们跟病人们长期相处，都心疼你们。
"We've been with patients for a long time, and we love you.
”微信群的另一端，病人们也在寻找出路。
At the other end of the spectrum, patients are also looking for a way out.
1月26日当天，13名病人通过各自的渠道，在汉阳医院等地找到了接收自己的血透中心。
On January 26, 13 patients through their own channels, such as the Hanyang hospital found their own blood transfusion center.
还有人拨通了12345市长热线，希望政府帮忙解决血透中心关闭的困难，接线员表示会记录大家的问题向上反映，让病人们等消息。
A 12345 mayoral hotline was called in the hope that the government would help resolve the difficulty of shutting down the Blood Transfusion Center. Operators said they would record their questions upward to let patients know.
截至当晚10点，已有56名患者找到了透析机位，尚未找到接收医院的仅剩4人。
By 10 p.m. that night, 56 patients had found dialysis machines, leaving only four who had not been found to receive the hospital.
━━━━━“阳性”患者接受了一对一治疗肖娟（化名）是没有着落的四人之一，也是一名“阳性”患者。
--William Somerset Shaudrun (alias) One of the four people who have not come to the surface is a man who is "masculine."
所谓“阳性”患者，是指患有病毒性肝炎等血液传染病的透析患者。
The so-called "positive" patients refer to patients with viral hepatitis and other blood-borne dialysis patients.
依据原卫生部2010年印发的《医疗机构血液透析室管理规范》，“阳性”患者要在隔离环境下进行专机血液透析，隔离区域及血液透析机不能与患有其他传染病的病人混用。
According to the regulations on the management of hemodialysis rooms in medical institutions issued by the former Ministry of Health in 2010, "positive" patients are required to undergo special haemodialysis in isolation, and the isolation area and dialysis machine cannot be mixed with patients suffering from other infectious diseases.
在病人圈里，为“阳性”患者透析的机器被称为阳性床位，数量很少。
In patients' circles, machines used to dialyze "positive" patients are called positive beds, a small number.
比如中医医院，血透中心共有17张床位，其中的阳性床位只有4张。
At the TCM Hospital, for example, there are 17 beds in the hemodialysis centre, of which only four are positive.
中医医院关闭后，肖娟联系了华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济医院（下称“同济医院”）的血透中心，对方就说下属分院的血透病人已被调到本部透析，床位已满。
After the closure of the TCM Hospital, Xiao Juan contacted the Blood Transfusion Centre of Tongji Hospital (Tongji Hospital) attached to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
她又联系了武汉协和医院、亚心总医院、汉阳医院，得到的答复相同：没床位了。
She contacted Wuhan Concorde Hospital, Asiatic General Hospital, Hanyang Hospital, received the same response: no beds.
▲一位患者挽起袖子，手臂上是常年透析形成的鼓包。
One patient rolled up his sleeves and his arm was bulged with dialysis all year round.
新京报记者 海阳 摄1月28日，肖娟已经4天没透析了。
The Beijing News reporter Haiyang January 28, Xiao Juan has not dialyzed for 4 days.
从前一天晚上开始，她就减少了喝水量。
From the night before, she had reduced her water intake.
当天下午，她没预约就来到了汉阳医院。
She went to Hanyang Hospital that afternoon without an appointment.
在一名医生的指引下，肖娟来到了血透科门口。
Under the guidance of a doctor, Xiao Juan came to the door of the hemodialysis department.
旁边服务窗口护士听说肖娟不是本院病人，也没有预约，告诉她血透科已经饱和，只能接待提前约好的病人。
The next service window nurse heard Xiao Juan is not a hospital patient, also did not have an appointment, told her that the hemodialysis department is saturated, can only receive the advance appointment of patients.
护士说，最近几天，血透科接收了从其他医院转来的20多名病人，医护人员已从两班制转为三班制，每天工作12个小时。
In recent days, the department has taken in more than 20 patients transferred from other hospitals, and health-care workers have moved from double to triple shifts, working 12-hour days, the nurse said.
那天下午，肖娟还是没能透析。
Xiao Juan had not been able to dialyse that afternoon.
当晚，肖娟等几名患者再次回到中医医院，希望帮忙重新安排。
That night, Xiao Juan and several other patients returned to the TCM hospital, hoping to help rearrange.
中医医院迅速与多家医院对接，协调后，她被分配至普爱医院古田院区透析。
The TCM hospital quickly docked with several hospitals and, after coordination, she was assigned to dialysis at the Gutien Hospital of Pui Ai Hospital.
1月29日晚8点半，肖娟完成了透析。
Xiao Juan finished dialysis at 8: 30 p.m. on January 29th.
因为是“阳性”患者，普爱医院专门为她开了一个晚班，一对一治疗。
Because she is a "positive" patient, universal love hospital opened a night shift for her, one-on-one treatment.
━━━━━关闭诊室是为避免交叉感染在中医医院一层大厅，肾病科医生王刚在3M口罩外又戴了一层蓝色医用口罩，过去几天，他一直在帮病人联系透析床位。
Dr. Wang, a nephrologist who has just worn a blue mask over the 3M mask, has been trying to contact patients with dialysis beds for the past few days.
王刚说，医院关闭血透中心的重要原因是被征用为发热定点医院。
Wang Gang said the main reason why the hospital closed the hemodialysis center was to be requisitioned as a febrile designated hospital.
被征用后，中医医院将划分出清洁区、污染区，清洁区是医护人员休息、生活的区域，污染区是可疑患者隔离住院的区域。
After the requisition, the TCM Hospital will divide the cleaning area, the polluted area is the area where the medical staff rest and live, and the contaminated area is the area where the suspected patient is hospitalized separately.
透析中心位于清洁区与污染区的中间地带，很容易交叉感染。
The dialysis center is located in the middle of the clean zone and the contaminated area.
“透析病人体质很差，高血压、营养不良等，感染的几率会高很多。
"Dialysis patients with poor health, high blood pressure, malnutrition, and so on, the risk of infection will be much higher.
”王刚的声音有些沙哑。
"Wang Gang's voice was hoarse.
中医医院医务处的一名工作人员也表示，一旦开放血透中心，很难阻止新冠病毒对透析病人的交叉感染。
A staff member of the TCM Medical Service also said it would be difficult to prevent cross-infection of dialysis patients with the new crown virus once the hemodialysis centre was opened.
“如果在院内出现非肺炎病人感染新冠病毒，那我们的责任就太大了。
"It would be too much of a responsibility if there were non-pneumonia patients in the hospital infected with the new crown virus."
”不过，并非所有发热定点医院都关闭了血透中心。
However, not all the fever hospitals have closed their blood transfusion centres.
据新京报记者不完全统计，24家被征用的发热定点医院中，市第五医院、普爱医院古田院区、市第三医院光谷院区未关闭血透中心；市中心医院后湖院区、市红十字会医院、同济医院中法新城院区等7家医院的血透中心已关闭。
According to incomplete statistics of the Beijing News, the hemodialysis centers have been closed in 7 of the 24 hospitals that have been requisitioned, including the Fifth Municipal Hospital, the Gutian Hospital of Pu Ai Hospital and the Guanggu Campus of City Hospital No. 3.
▲1月28日，中医医院血透中心所在的四层已人被清空。
January 28, the Chinese Medical Hospital blood transfusion center where the four floors have been emptied.
新京报记者 海阳 摄对此，中医医院肾病科副主任医师刘涛表示，“新冠肺炎属于飞沫传播的传染病，每个人都有可能感染。
"The new crown pneumonia is a droplet-borne infectious disease and everyone can get infected," said Liu Tao, deputy director of nephrology at the TCM Hospital.
所以血透中心是否关闭，关键要看血透室和发热门诊是不是连在一起、是不是在同一栋楼里。
So whether or not the hemodialysis center is closed depends on whether the hemodialysis room and the fever clinic are linked together or in the same building.
”市第五医院之所以能够保留血透中心，就是因为它在门诊楼外，病人交叉感染的可能性小。
City Hospital No. 5 was able to keep the hemodialysis centre because it was outside the outpatient building and patients were less likely to cross-infect.
而在中医医院，血透中心位于门诊楼四层中部，南部是急诊科，北部是医护人员办公室，一条狭长的走廊将它们贯穿到一起。
In the TCM hospital, the hemodialysis centre is located in the middle of the fourth floor of the outpatient building, the emergency department in the south and the medical staff's office in the north.
“像我们医院这样的，血透室和发热门诊很难隔开，所以只能关闭。
"A hemodialysis unit and a fever clinic like ours are hard to separate, so they have to be shut down.
”━━━━━透析费跨医院结算转院后的治疗费用问题，成为另一个难题。
-- -- Dialysis Fee The cost of treatment after the transfer of hospital settlements across hospitals is another difficult issue.
据一位患者介绍，依据国家相关规定，门诊重症慢性病人申请门诊重症疾病鉴定后，可选择一家医保定点医院就诊并报销治疗费，透析患者的报销比例约为87%。
According to one patient, patients with severe chronic diseases in outpatient clinics may choose a health-care designated hospital and reimburse the cost of treatment, according to state regulations. The reimbursement rate for dialysis patients is about 87 percent.
但如果不在选择的定点医院透析，费用就不能报销。
However, expenses cannot be reimbursed if dialysis is not done at selected designated hospitals.
这位患者说，自费的话，每次费用大约700元，一周三次2000多元，一个月就是8000多元，“我家里条件好，一两个月能承受得起，但是时间长了怎么办？更不用说很多透析病人都是低保户了。
At his own expense, he said, he would spend about 700 yuan on each visit, more than 2,000 yuan three times a week, or more than 8,000 yuan for a month.My family is in good condition, and I can afford it in a month or two, but what about the time it takes
”相较于中医医院，一些被征用为发热定点医院的血透中心，提早为病人安排了转院。
Compared with the traditional Chinese medicine hospital, some of the blood transfusion centres that were requisitioned for the Fever Destination Hospital arranged for patients to be transferred earlier.
比如尿毒症患者王勇（化名）。
Like uremic patient Wang Yong (alias).
此前，市红十字会医院是王勇的门诊重症慢性病定点医院。
Previously, the City Red Cross Hospital is Wang Yong out-patient acute chronic diseases designated hospital.
过年之前，医院得知将被征用后，马上通知了王勇。
Before the New Year, the hospital learned that it would be requisitioned, immediately notified Wang Yong.
王勇很快联系了市中心医院后湖院区的血透中心，将其作为新的透析点，社保关系也跟着转了过去。
Wang Yong quickly contacted the hemodialysis center in the backlake courtyard of the downtown hospital and used it as a new dialysis site.
后来，后湖院区也被征用，王勇又转到了市中心医院南京路院区透析。
Later, Houhu courtyard area was also requisitioned, Wang Yong transferred to the downtown hospital Nanjing Road courtyard dialysis.
但因为后湖院区和南京路院区同属市中心医院，所以报销不成问题。
But because Houhu courtyard area and Nanjing Road courtyard area belong to city center hospital, so reimbursement is not a problem.
▲1月26日晚，中医医院肾病科的医生努力了一天后，终于为56名患者找到了出路。
On the night of January 26, doctors at the nephrology department of the TCM Hospital managed to find a way out for 56 patients after a day's hard work.
新京报记者 海阳 摄“像王勇这种情况，可能市红十字会医院接到消息比较早，所以有时间安排。
"As Wang Yong this case, maybe the city Red Cross hospital received the news earlier, so there is a time schedule.
”刘涛说，但中医医院是1月26日才接到关闭门诊、关闭血透中心的通知的，1月27日起就要实施。
But the hospital was notified on January 26 that it would close the clinic and close the hemodialysis centre, with effect from January 27, Liu said.
这中间时间过于仓促，确实难为患者谋划出路。
This time is too hasty, indeed difficult to plan the way out for the patient.
但中医医院也想到了一些解决方案，比如与普爱医院协商后决定，先行免去患者们在普爱医院的透析费用，日后再由中医医院与普爱医院结算。
But the TCM hospital has also come up with some solutions, such as a decision to waive dialysis fees at Pu Ai Hospital in consultation with Pu Ei Hospital and later settle the matter between TCM Hospital and Pu Ai Hospital.
另一方面，随着武汉市多家医院的血透中心陆续关闭，仍在运转的血透中心超负荷运行。
On the other hand, with the closure of the hemodialysis centers in Wuhan, the hemodialysis centers, which are still in operation, are overloaded.
据患者透露，目前，市中心医院南京路院区的血透中心已是“24小时连轴转”的状态，医护人员实行四班制，白天、夜间都是“8点到12点一班，1点到5点一班”。
According to the patient, the blood transfusion center in the Nanjing Road Hospital is now running on a 24-hour shift, with medical staff operating on a four-shift basis from 8: 00 to 12: 00 and from 1: 00 to 5: 00 at night.
1月29日，市中心医院南京路院区血透中心的工作人员婉拒了新京报记者的采访，但表示他们接纳了后湖院区的200多名透析患者，现收治透析患者总数超过500人。
On January 29, staff at the Nanjing Road Hospital's Blood Transfusion Center declined an interview with the Beijing News, but said they had admitted more than 200 dialysis patients to the Houhu district, bringing the total number of dialysis patients to more than 500.
针对目前的情况，武汉市某医院血透中心护士长表示，虽然超负荷运转，但依然会为病人们提供治疗，因为每个病人都有生存的权利。
In view of the current situation, the head nurse at the Blood Transfusion Center of a hospital in Wuhan said that although the operation was overloaded, patients would still be treated because every patient had the right to live.
