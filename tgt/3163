本视频为系列第一集。
This video is the first in a series.
该内容为《时尚先生 Esquire》与腾讯新闻独家合作内容，谢绝转载 无尽的黑夜 无数的人们2020 年 2 月 9 日晚九点，邢玲的大巴经过武汉市长江二桥的时候，河对岸大楼外墙的 LED 循环播放着「武汉加油」、「中国必胜」，她感觉有点激动。
By 9: 00 pm on Feb. 9, 2020, when Xing Ling's bus passed the Yangtze II Bridge in Wuhan city, the LED on the outside wall of the building across the river was playing "Wuhan refueling" and "China wins." She felt a little excited.
人生总得有点不平凡的经历才作数——她这么认为——她作为护士的那份就在前方，在武汉同济医院光谷院区 E1 区 6 层，里面住着 44 名新冠肺炎重症患者，正由她南京鼓楼医院的同事们照料着。
There had to be something extraordinary in her life- she thought - her job as a nurse was in front of her, on the 6th floor of E1, in the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, where 44 patients with severe pneumonia were being cared for by her colleagues at Drum Tower Hospital in Nanjing.
鼓楼的医护们到达时，他们有三十个小时为收治新冠肺炎重症患者做好准备（按照常规这至少要两天），设计医护行走的线路、分隔出病毒无法侵袭的区域，并为第一批 44 名病人制定治疗方案。
When the Drum Tower paramedics arrived, they were given 30 hours to prepare for the arrival of patients with severe coronary pneumonia (which would normally take at least two days), design walking routes, isolate areas inaccessible to the virus and develop treatment protocols for the first group of 44 patients.
时间紧迫，对于病人也是如此，他们正穿过初春午夜的雨，从宾馆、方舱医院以及其他的隔离点赶往光谷。
Time was pressing, as was the case for the sick, who were making their way through the midnight rain of early spring to the Valley of Light from hotels, cabin hospitals and other isolation points.
病人和医护们在凌晨一点相遇：这多少暗含着危险，武汉感染的医护已逾千名。
Patients and paramedics met at 1 a. m.: It was more or less dangerous, and Wuhan was infected with more than a thousand medical personnel.
联络员和护士长在病区的铁门后最后一次核对床位——门把手被不断转动，敲门声传来，楼梯口很冷，狭小，病人们疲劳而且焦虑——护士们守在病房门口，等待护士长喊床号——门外传来喊声，有人倒了，护士长推开门，门前的病人一个头挤过来，门后的病人拉住门想要进去。
The liaison officer and the head nurse checked their beds for the last time behind the iron gate in the sick area - the doorknobs were turning, knocks on the door, the staircase was cold, narrow, the patients tired and anxious - the nurses were waiting for the matron to shout for the bed.
病人们近些天来已经习惯了用适当的「暴力」谋取生存。
In recent days patients have become accustomed to using appropriate "violence" to survive.
困在门外的无数的患者当中，一位去了隔离点、因为没有医生没有药又回家的女士半夜四点给社区书记打电话，问他：「我高烧 39 度住不进去医院你看怎么办」；一位全家确诊，妻子病重，打市长区长专线打不通的先生对社区工作人员说：再不安排我们就只能去你门口坐着了；有在外地的子女给疾控和区政府打电话，几天下来得到的回复都是没有床位，于是告诉对方：「已经把你们的电话录音了，要去告你们」。
Among the numerous patients trapped outside, a woman who went home without a doctor and returned home called the community secretary at four in the morning and asked him, "I have a fever of 39 degrees and can't go to the hospital."
但仍然没有床位，直到现在，在武汉同济医院光谷院区 E1区六层病房门的门口，终于有一些病人看到了救治的希望。
But there are still no beds, until now, in Wuhan Tongji Hospital Guanggu courtyard area E1 six-storey ward door, finally some patients see hope of treatment.
虽然这时困在楼梯口的 44 位病人（还有一位需要紧急手术的在转运来的路上）大都重症，但他们中的绝大多数仅有轻度的发热、咳嗽、胸闷和厌食，并将在之后的一两周里逐渐康复。
While most of the 44 patients trapped on the stairway (and one on the way in transit that required emergency surgery) were seriously ill, the vast majority of them had only mild fever, coughing, chest tightness and anorexia, and would gradually recover in the next week or two.
令他们恐慌的是缺乏照料和医药，亲人的感染，以及常出现在想象中的恶化和病危。
What scares them is the lack of care and medicine, the infection of loved ones, and the often-imagined deterioration and illness.
在接下来的日子里，南京的医护们除了开药输液、照料起居，更艰巨的任务是在穿着看不到脸的防护，必须和病人保持距离的同时，安抚病人的心，安抚他们对疾病的恐惧，对家人的思念，对隔离中种种不理想的生活条件的怨言。
In the next few days, Nanjing doctors and nurses, in addition to prescribing infusions and taking care of their homes, will be faced with the more difficult task of wearing face-hidden protective clothing that must be kept at arm's length while at the same time assuaging patients' hearts, assuaging their fears of disease, missing their families and complaining about the unsatisfactory living conditions in isolation.
在未来的两周里，鼓楼医院的医护们将会见到想念儿子的哭泣的母亲，母亲去世自己病危的叹息的儿子，不停从病房里闯出来的老人，给每个医生都留了电话希望他们能多关注自己病情的老人，还有躺在另一幢楼里的 CT 机——路很远，志愿者和医护都紧缺，这是前所未有的挑战。
In the next two weeks, Drum Tower Hospital's doctors will meet with a crying mother who missed her son, a sighing son whose mother died, a sighs son who was dying, an elderly man who keeps breaking out of the ward, and a CT machine in another building - a long way off, with no shortage of volunteers and medical care.
而护士邢玲，将作为第二批队伍中的一员赶往武汉。
Xing Ling, a nurse, will be on her way to Wuhan as part of the second team.
在那里，她第一次穿上防护服，在呼吸困难的情况下连续完成高强度的护理工作。
There, for the first time, she put on protective clothing and continued to perform intensive care work in difficult breathing conditions.
她的梦想、责任与执着，将成为我们日后回忆与纪念这一场疫情防控战时，看似微小但具有鲜活色彩的注脚。
Her dream, responsibility and tenacity will be our future memories and commemorations of this epidemic prevention and control war, seemingly small but vivid footnotes.
