2007-9-25 21: 48 A doctor at the Hanchuan People's Hospital told the Beijing News that there was a severe shortage of materials, that N95 face masks were no longer in use and that frontline medical staff could only continue to work in two layers of medical surgical masks.

He said doctors and nurses have stopped working, 1,600 are on duty, consume more than 2,000 face masks a day and consume serious supplies: "Now all the N95 masks in Hanchuan are out of stock and there is no place to buy them.

What we lack most is this mask.

Rubber gloves were also used quickly, the doctor said, and now stocks are running low: "Health-care workers need to examine patients in complete isolation.
”他表示，目前这些物资都很难在市内买到，“我们直接去过医疗器材厂调货，但是效果并不理想。
"We have been directly to the medical equipment factory to transfer the goods, but the results have not been ideal," he said.
”这名医生称，无奈下，医院只能向社会求助，通过志愿者扩散出去，进行筹集，或通过官方慈善机构筹集。
The doctor said hospitals were forced to turn to society for help, spread out through volunteers, raise money or raise money through official charities.
此外，这名医生称，虽然向社会募捐护目镜，但是需要提示捐助者，并非所有护目镜都符合医用防护的要求。
In addition, the doctor stated that although goggles were solicited from the community, donors needed to be reminded that not all goggles met medical protection requirements.
“需要那种眼眶周围带着橡胶圈的，能够将眼睛安全与外界隔离开，以免细菌从眼部入侵。
"You need rubber bands around your eyes to keep your eyes safe from the outside world and keep them out of the way.

”一名医生告诉新京报记者，目前医护人员们格外注意，尽量减少更换的频率，但是口罩还是不够用。
A doctor told the Beijing News that doctors and nurses are taking extra care to minimize the frequency of changes, but masks are still not enough.
“像是口罩、橡胶手套以及防护服，很多都是一次性使用的，一旦反复使用，就失去了原本的功效。
"Many of these masks, rubber gloves and protective clothing are disposable and lose their effectiveness once they are used repeatedly.
”这名医生称，目前医院也在自己想办法，但效果并不好：“断货太严重，和厂商问，他们也说不清到底什么时候能够有货。
The doctor said the hospital was doing its own thing, but the effect was not good: "The outages were so severe that the manufacturer asked when they would be able to have them.
