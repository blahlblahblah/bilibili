我们愿意接受14天的隔离政策，我们一家三口只想回家，孩子要准备上学，我也要工作，谁能帮帮我吗？口述 | 胡路豪整理 | 周　洁1月19日，我带着老婆孩子自驾回到了湖北省安陆市一个乡村，这里是我岳父岳母的家。
We are willing to accept the 14-day policy of isolation. Our family just wants to go home, the kids are going to school, and I have to work, too.
原本，我们打算大年初二返回我们现在的定居地——广东惠州，没想到疫情爆发后，先是武汉封城，很快封城的政策又扩展到了整个湖北。
Originally, we plan to return to our current settlement - Huizhou, Guangdong Province, did not expect the outbreak of the outbreak of the first Wuhan, soon after the closure of the city's policies and extended to the whole Hubei.
1月26日一早，我带着老婆孩子和回家的行李，开车上了高速，我们一开始去的是安陆烟店收费站，到了高速路口发现那个收费站已经全部封闭了，走高速显然已经行不通。
On the morning of January 26, I took my wife and kids and my luggage home and drove onto the freeway. We started at the Anlu Tavern toll station and found the turnstile was completely closed.
不过我没有放弃，上不了高速，我准备和家人走省道，开往省道的路上有一条必须经过的马路，没想到到了那里以后，一辆货车横在了马路中间，车子开不过去，这条路也被封死了。
But I didn't give up, I couldn't get on the highway, I was going to take the provincial road with my family and there was a road that had to be crossed on the way to the provincial road.
没办法，我们只能再找其他小路，但开来开去，找到的小路也都摆放了拦路的大石头，我们如同迷路的蚂蚁，尝试了几个方案后，最终只能放弃回到岳父家。
No way, we had to find other paths, but drive back and forth, found the path has been placed in the stone road, we like lost ants, tried several schemes, finally had to give up back to his father-in-law's home.
这些天我一直在找回广东的办法，2月3日，我看导航上有一条可以通行的路，就自己开着车去探路。
I have been trying to find the way back to Guangdong these days. On February 3, I saw a passable road on the navigation and drove my own car to find the way.
7:30出发的时候很顺利，也没人拦我，结果路不通之后，我大概在8:20回到村里，发现村里已经设置了路障，回不了家了。
When I set out smoothly and no one stopped me, I returned to the village at about 8: 20 and found that a barricade had been set up in the village and I could not return home.
Play我只能打电话给村里的领导，登记后才回到我岳父家，那天之后我没有再出去过。
I had to call the village authorities to check in and then go back to my father-in-law's house. I haven't been out since that day.
也出不去。
I can't get out.
现在出村的路上拦着一辆货车，只有拥有通行证，才能过。
Now there is a lorry on the way out of the village. Only a pass can pass.
村里的路障　受访者提供说到通行证，这些天我为了它打了无数个电话，交通局、防疫局、市长热线、安陆市的惠州市的。
The village barricade interviewee provided said the pass, I made innumerable calls for it these days, traffic bureau, epidemic prevention bureau, mayor's hotline, the city of Anlu city Huizhou.
我打电话给安陆市交通局时，他们告诉我，要走可以，但开通行证需要三个条件：1．返回地社区同意返回接收证明；2．返回地防疫部门同意返回接收证明；3．目前所在地的健康证明。
When I called the Anlu Transportation Office, they told me that I could go, but there were three conditions for issuing a permit: 1. The community of return agreed to return to the receiving certificate; 2. The vaccination department at the place of return agreed to return to the reception certificate; 3.
我和家人回湖北的一个月，身体都是健康的——没有去医院看过病，没有感冒、发烧、咳嗽等等，所以健康证明我们很快就开好了。
My family and I returned to Hubei healthy for a month - no hospital visits, no colds, fevers, coughs, etc., so our health proved that we were getting better soon.
但是在开具惠州市的两个接收证明时，我们遇到了麻烦。
But we got into trouble when we issued two acceptance certificates in Huizhou.
我住在惠州市大亚湾澳头社区，我给社区打电话，对方告诉我，惠州政府目前的文件中，政府没有开接收证明的规定。
I live in Daya Bay Aotou community in Huizhou City, I called the community, the other side told me that the Huizhou government's current documents, the government did not open the acceptance certificate requirements.
我打电话给惠州大亚湾防疫中心，对方也是跟我这样说。
I called the Daya Bay Prevention Center in Huizhou and that's what they said to me.
我还给惠州市的相关政府单位打过电话，惠州方面说，目前进入惠州只需要在家隔离14天，他们的通行证不需要开这样的证明。
Huizhou, where I also called relevant government units, said it was only necessary to enter Huizhou for 14 days, their permits do not need to be issued such certificates.
他们告诉我，我这样的情况不是个例，针对这个问题，他们也已经汇报给了领导，但现在还不能解决我的问题。
They told me that I was not alone in this situation and that they had reported back to the leadership on this issue, but that it was not yet possible to solve my problem.
事实上，我的一个朋友，最近已经从湖北回到了深圳，他家在石首市，通行证只需要健康证明就可以了，现在他已经开始在家自我隔离。
In fact, a friend of mine, who recently returned to Shenzhen from Hubei, only needed a health certificate to get a permit, and he is now isolated at home.
显然他们的通行证要求要更加人性化也更加高效。
Clearly, their laissez-passer requirements need to be more humane and efficient.
朋友的通行证　受访者提供其实，进入广东也是需要做信息登记工作的。
Friends laissez-passer respondents to provide the fact that the entry into Guangdong is also required to do information registration.
“粤省事”的微信小程序有入粤登记的信息填报入口，我咨询安陆市交通局，我们外地车主在粤省事登记成功是不是就不用开证明了，安陆市交通局回复不行。
"Guangdong Province matter" micro-letter procedures have entered the Guangdong registered information entry, I consulted the Anlu City Transport Bureau, we do not have to register the success of the Guangdong Province business is not a certificate, Anlu City Transport Bureau replied not.
电话里，安陆市交通局的工作人员告诉我，他们已经为符合条件的车主发放了一些通行证，言下之意，没有社区和防疫部门的接收证明，我还是回不去惠州的家里。
On the phone, I was told by the agency staff that they had issued some passes to eligible owners, implying that I would not be able to return to my home in Huizhou without a certificate of acceptance from the community and immunization authorities.
现在我被两个地区不同的政策要求卡在了这里，心里实在是很难受。
Now that I'm stuck here with different policy demands from two regions, it's hard to be here.
待在岳父家快一个月了，虽然大家都是家里人，不过时间一长，生活难免还是有些不方便。
Stay in his father-in-law's house nearly a month, although we are all family, but a long time, life is still a little inconvenient.
另一个现实的问题是，我们之前回来，只带了我的银行卡和现金，银行卡里钱不多，待在家的这个月里已经花得差不多了，其他的存款都在我老婆的卡里，她的卡放在惠州，也没有开通网银，我的车贷、房贷、信用卡无法还款......没办法，我只能找朋友借了5000块，先把这个月应付过去，但疫情不知何时是个头，这终究不是个办法。
Another real problem is, we came back with my bank card and cash, the bank card is not much money, stay at home this month has almost spent, her card in Huizhou, her card in Huizhou, my car loan, mortgage, credit card can not repay... no way, I can only borrow a friend to deal with this month, but it is not an option.
