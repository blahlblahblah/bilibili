经济观察网 记者 李紫宸 北京报道2020年的春节，和国内的其他城市一样，北京也少了往年的热闹。
Li Zichen, a reporter on the Economic Watch network, reported that the Spring Festival in 2020, like other cities in China, Beijing is less boisterous in previous years.
。
.
疫情像是蔓延的海水，让城市变成了一座座海上的岛屿，居民的活动也因之而骤减。
The epidemic, like the spread of the sea, has turned the city into islands of the sea, and the activities of its inhabitants have been drastically reduced.
骑手这份特别的职业，成为了维系城市运转必不可少的一环。
The special profession of rider became an indispensable part of keeping the city going.
。
.
冯飞，老家山西，是美团外卖的一名普通骑手。
Feng Fei, from Shanxi, is an ordinary rider on a take-out tour.
春节期间，他没有回家，而是选择留在了北京加班。
During the Spring Festival, instead of going home, he chose to stay in Beijing to work overtime.
。
.
这个春节的外卖订单，比以往任何时候都要少，这让他能在中午赶回宿舍。
He was able to get back to his dorm room at noon with fewer take-out orders than ever before.
他期盼着疫情能早点儿结束，让一切回到正轨。
He looked forward to an early end to the epidemic and a return to normal.
。
.
中午能回宿舍吃顿媳妇儿做的饭了。
I can go back to my dorm for dinner at noon.
2月5日下午3点，冯飞和记者通过微信语音连上了线。
Feb. 5 at 3 p.m., Feng Fei and reporters via microphone voice connected to the line.
对他来说，这是过去一年中难得的轻松一些的日子。
For him, it was one of the more relaxing days of the past year.
。
.
每天上午9点上班，冯飞开始他的第一单生意，这比从前要晚上两个小时。
Every morning at 9 a.m. Feng Fei starts his first business, which is two hours later than before.
2月4日这天，农历正月十一，他一共只送出了八单外卖。
On February 4, the eleventh day of the first month of the lunar calendar, he sent out only eight takeaway items.
。
.
长安街上的车辆和行人都甚为稀少，这是他几乎每天都要经行的线路。
Traffic and pedestrians were scarce on Chang'an Street, the route through which he travelled almost every day.
冯飞负责的片区，写字楼偏多，居民楼较少。
Feng Fei responsible for the block, office buildings too much, residents less.
在一些小区密集的地方，骑手的单量会相对忙碌一些。
In some densely populated areas, the rider is relatively busy.
“很多人还没有从家乡返工，回来的人当中，也有很多人也不怎么叫餐了。
"A lot of people haven't returned from work, and a lot of those who have come back don't have much to ask for.
”冯飞说。
"said Feng Fei.
。
.
年后这几天，冯飞平均下来每天也就跑十几单，这个单量只有疫情之前的三到四分之一。
In the next few days, Feng Fei ran a dozen or so a day on average, only three to a quarter of what it had been before the outbreak.
在疫情之前，赶上高峰期的时候，冯飞一天甚至能送出五十单。
Prior to the outbreak, Feng Feifei was able to deliver even 50 in a day to catch the peak.
。
.
这八单当中，有五单是蔬菜和水果，只有三单是餐饮。
Of the eight, five are vegetables and fruits, and only three are meals.
冯飞说，疫情期间点餐的人明显少了，供应餐饮的商家也不是很多，三单餐饮都是来自附近商场的一家连锁品牌店，而这家店目前也只供应外卖，并不提供店内就餐服务。
'There were significantly fewer people ordering food during the epidemic and not many restaurants, 'Mr. Feng said.' All three were from a chain of stores in a nearby mall that currently serves only takeaway food and doesn't offer in-store meals.
。
.
因疫情原因，很多居民为减少外出频次，一次性下单的水果、蔬菜会比从前多很多，冯飞电动车上的外卖箱，常常是塞得满满的状态。
As a result of the epidemic, many residents will order much more fruits and vegetables at a time to reduce the frequency of travel, and the takeaway boxes on Feng Fei's electric cars are often packed to capacity.
。
.
疫情期间，防护是较为严格的。
During the epidemic, protection was relatively strict.
冯飞所属的公司美团外卖在每个站点配备了体温计、口罩、消毒液和酒精凝胶，骑手餐箱早晚必须消毒，每日早晚测量骑手体温，跟进每位骑手每天上报的健康状况，建立骑手健康台账，并增加抽检次数，如有异常症状骑手要立即停止工作、安排就医并及时报备。
Each site is equipped with a thermometer, mask, disinfectant and alcohol gel. The rider must disinfect every night and evening, measure the rider's body temperature every morning and evening, follow up on every rider's reported health every day, establish a rider's health checkup, and increase the number of checks.
。
.
公司给冯飞发放了口罩和消毒液。
The company distributed masks and disinfectant to Feng Fei.
每天晚上十点回到家后，他要认真洗手，并给浑身上下、包括鞋底进行一番全面的消毒。
When he gets home at ten every night, he should wash his hands carefully and disinfect his whole body, including the soles of his shoes.
“我们每天在群里做防疫宣导，包括APP上都有各种防疫知识”，他说。
"We do vaccination campaigns in groups every day, including all kinds of epidemic prevention knowledge on APPs," he said.
。
.
每一单都只是送到小区的门口。
Every single order is sent to the door of the community.
疫情期间，北京的小区基本都实行严格的进出管制措施，小区的门口会设置专门的进出管理人员。
During the epidemic period, Beijing's residential areas are basically strict access control measures, will be set up at the entrance to the special management personnel.
冯飞说，不少社区会在大门处设置一个外卖的存放点，冯飞会打电话通知客人过来取走，或者和客人商量好，把东西放在客人指定的地方，再由他们来取。
Feng said many communities will set up a take-out location at the main entrance. Feng will call guests to pick them up, or negotiate with them to put things where the guests have designated them, and then they will pick them up.
。
.
因为是送餐服务，冯飞吃饭的时间必须和一般人错开，一般可能会晚上两个小时。
Since it was the delivery service, Feng Fei's meal had to be staggered with ordinary people, usually two hours in the evening.
在平时，冯飞可以在与公司有合作的餐饮店吃到专门的“骑手餐”，价格通常比市面要便宜不少——只需要花费十几块钱。
In normal times, Feng Fei can eat a special "rider's meal" at a restaurant with which the company works, usually at a much lower price than the market - for a few dozen dollars.
。
.
但这些天，冯飞没有吃骑手餐。
But these days Feng Fei did not eat the rider's meal.
远在山西老家的媳妇儿来了北京探望他，又逢单量减少，他可以在中午的时候回到宿舍，吃上媳妇儿做的饭了。
The daughter-in-law from Shanxi's hometown came to Beijing to see him. He could return to his dormitory at noon and eat the food his daughter-in-law had cooked.
。
.
一个果篮的温情。
The warmth of a fruit basket.
在冯飞负责的王府井片区，一共有三个骑手站点，每个站大概有70人。
In the Wangfujing area headed by Feng Fei, there are three rider stations, each with about 70 people.
在他的片区，和他一样留下了的，大概有平时一半数量的骑手。
In his quarter, as he had left, there were about half as many riders as usual.
。
.
决定春节留在北京继续工作时，疫情还没有来临。
When it was decided to stay in Beijing for the Spring Festival, the epidemic had not come.
按照惯例，春节加班，收入要比平时高出许多，冯飞因为这个简单的理由留了下来。
According to the custom, the Spring Festival overtime, income than usual much higher, Feng Fei because of this simple reason to stay.
。
.
冯飞说，疫情期间的派送，让他感受到了更多的人与人之间的温情。
Feng Fei said that during the outbreak of the delivery, let him feel more people between the warmth.
有的客人会在电话里跟他道一声“辛苦”，说一句“保重身体”，也有的客人，会在订单的“备注”里告诉他“注意安全”，这都让他觉得感动。
Some guests will say "hard" to him on the phone, said "take care of the body," or guests, in the "Remarks" of the order, told him to "pay attention to safety," which touched him.
。
.
1月29日下午，冯军良派送了一单水果果篮，送达地址显示是北京协和医院呼吸科的护士站。
On the afternoon of January 29, Feng Junliang sent a fruit basket to the nurse station of the respiratory department of Beijing Concorde Hospital.
“到了之后医护人员很惊讶，问是谁送的，事实上我也不知道是谁送的，那一刻我也才反应过来，这应该是有人专门送给医生，表达疫情期间对他们的一份心意。
"Surprised, the paramedics asked who sent it, and I didn't know who sent it," he said. "I didn't know who sent it.
”。
"
虽然在这样特殊的时期，每天还是要跑不同的地方，但冯飞并没有对安全上有多大的惶恐。
Although in such a special period of time, each day has to run different places, but Feng Fei did not have a great deal of security fear.
“北京虽然也有确诊的病例，但相对来说不算严重的地区。
"Although there have been confirmed cases in Beijing, it is a relatively minor area.
一方面，公司在安全措施上做得很好，另一方面，我自己的心也比较大。
On the one hand, the company has done a good job on security measures, on the other hand, my own heart is bigger.
”冯飞说。
"said Feng Fei.
。
.
比他在心理上更担忧的是远在山西的母亲。
What worries him more psychologically is his mother in Shanxi.
几乎每天，冯飞的母亲会通过电话或是消息，叮嘱他几句。
Almost every day, Feng Fei's mother would call him or tell him something.
。
.
疫情形势丝毫还没有减轻的迹象，冯飞和他的同事们，也不可避免会聊到外面不断增加的病例。
The epidemic shows no sign of abating, and Feng and his colleagues will inevitably talk about the growing number of cases outside.
。
.
“光害怕也不行，大家都怕了那全国人民总不能啥都不干。
"Fear alone will not do, for we are all afraid that the nation will not be able to do nothing.
确实，疫情后面的动向咱也搞不清楚，但是我们还是要坚定信心，反正该怎么样怎么样，我们的业务只要还在开展，我们就得坚守岗位。
Yes, we don't know what's going on behind the epidemic, but we have to be confident that whatever happens, as long as our business is going on, we'll have to stay on the job.
“冯飞说。
said Feng Fei.
。
.
上一次回老家是去年九月，冯飞目前还没想过什么时候再回老家。
The last time I went back to my hometown was last September, Feng Fei didn't think about when he would return home.
“先把手头的工作干好，回家的事，等夏天再说吧。
"Get the job done, go home, and wait till summer.
”他告诉记者。
"he told reporters.
。
.
现在，比安全问题更让他感到担忧的，是疫情对经济的影响。
Now, more worrying than security is the impact of the epidemic on the economy.
临结束对话的时候，冯飞说：“希望疫情能早点结束，我们也都能步入正轨。
At the end of the dialogue, Feng said: "Hopefully the epidemic will end soon and we can all get back on track.
”。
