因怀疑人民币上可能沾染“新冠肺炎病毒”，近日江苏无锡江阴市的李阿姨居然把现金放进微波炉中加热消毒，3000多元人民币被烤得面目全非。
Auntie Li, who lives in Jiangyin, Jiangsu Province, recently put cash into a microwave oven to disinfect her suspected renminbi exposure.
那么，钞票到底是如何消毒的？能否放心使用呢？近日李阿姨因担心钞票上留有病毒，就把钱放到微波炉里消毒。
So, how does money disinfect after all? Can worry about use? Auntie Li recently worried about the virus on the bill, put the money into the microwave oven to disinfect.
还不到一分钟，微波炉就飘出了焦煳味。
Within a minute, the microwave was charred.
李阿姨慌忙取出现金，但为时已晚，纸币大部分碳化至黑色，再想花出去是不可能了。
Aunt Li hastily withdrew the cash, but it was too late. Most of the notes had carbonized to black. It was impossible to spend any more.
看着被烤得面目全非的“火烧币”，李阿姨心痛不已，来到中信银行江阴支行寻求帮助。
Looking at the baked face of the "burning coin," Aunt Li heartache, came to Citic Bank Jiangyin branch for help.
由于“火烧币”这种残损币比较特殊，碳化部分较多，无法通过仪器辨别，银行人员只能凭借手工清分数量和鉴定真伪，操作难度较大。
Because the "burning coin" this kind of damaged currency is special, the carbonization part is more, cannot distinguish through the instrument, the bank personnel can only rely on the handwork cleans up the quantity and the appraisal truth, the operation difficulty is big.
在清点过程中，轻轻一碰“火烧币”就往下掉渣，为了防止二次破损，需要小心翼翼地揭开、摊平，再将纸币粘在同等大小的白纸上。
In the course of the inventory, lightly touch the "burning coin" to drop slag, in order to prevent secondary damage, need to be carefully uncovered, flat, and then paper money on the same size of white paper.
经过鉴别、清点、确认，银行全额为李阿姨兑换了3125元崭新的人民币。
After identifying, counting and confirming, the bank cashed out 3125 yuan for Aunt Li in full.
中信银行南京分行相关负责人介绍，在当前疫情防控的特殊时期，从金融机构出来的都是“干净钱”，可放心使用。
In the current special period of epidemic prevention and control, "clean money" is coming out of financial institutions and can be put to good use, said relevant officials of Citic Bank Nanjing Branch.
商业银行按照人民银行要求，对疫情防控重点地区回笼现金，采取紫外线或者高温等消毒，存放14天以上再投放市场；对于非疫情防控重点地区现金消毒以后，存放7天以上再投放市场。
Commercial banks, in accordance with the requirements of the People's Bank, return cash to key areas for epidemic prevention and control, disinfect it with ultraviolet light or high temperature, store it on the market for more than 14 days, and then place it on the market for more than 7 days after disinfecting cash in key areas of non-epidemic prevention and control.
那么，在防控疫情的特殊时期，人们能否放心地使用现金？为确保老百姓使用现金的安全和卫生，人民银行等相关部门做出一系列安排。
So, in the special period of epidemic prevention and control, can people use cash safely? To ensure the safety and health of cash, the People's Bank of China and other related departments have made a series of arrangements.
一方面确保新钞供应，暂停了现金跨省调拨以及部分疫情严重地区的省内调拨；另一方面，严格落实收支两条线，重点单位回笼的现金暂存库房，流通中的现金消毒处理后才能投放。
On the one hand, cash transfers across provinces were suspended, as well as transfers within provinces in some areas with severe epidemics. On the other hand, two lines of income and expenditure were strictly implemented.
1月17日以前人民银行已向全国安排调拨近6000亿元新钞，春节前紧急向武汉投放了40亿元新钞。
Before January 17, the People's Bank of China had allocated nearly 600 billion yuan of new banknotes to the country, and 4 billion yuan in emergency relief was given to Wuhan before the Spring Festival.
人民银行要求，对外付出现金尽可能以新钞为主，回笼现金时对医院、农贸市场等渠道回笼的现金采取特殊处理并单独封存，消毒后交存人民银行，不得对外支付。
The People's Bank of China requires that as much cash as possible be paid abroad in new banknotes, and that cash withdrawn from hospitals, farmers' markets and other channels be treated as special treatment and sealed separately when cashed in cash.
各家银行又是如何给现金消毒“洗澡”的呢？1、每日日终，银行清点人员佩戴一次性手套、口罩，用84消毒液擦拭款箱内外，装款时仔细确认款箱已干燥，避免因潮湿对现金造成影响。
At the end of the day, bank staff wear disposable gloves, face masks, wipe the boxes with 84 disinfectant, and carefully confirm that the boxes are dry to avoid the impact of dampness on cash.
2、对当日收入的现金进行清点。
2. Conduct a cash count of income at the same date.
3、清点结束后，现金将进行紫外线灯照射消毒，消毒灯工作时网点人员离场，同时使用酒精或84消毒液对出纳机进行擦拭消毒处理。
After the check, the cash will be irradiated with ultraviolet light, the network personnel will leave the field while the disinfection lights are working, and the teller machine will be cleaned and disinfected with alcohol or disinfectant 84.
4、消毒后现金单独装入款箱。
After disinfection, the cash is put in a separate piggy bank.
5、针对医院等重点单位回笼的钞券，银行严格把关，延长消毒时间，单独进行消毒、清分，单独入账、交接，验收装包，用封条标注“医院收款”等字样，开辟专属区域存放消毒后的现钞，确保不对外付出。
Banks strictly check and lengthen the time for disinfection, make separate disinfection and clear marks, make separate entries, hand over and take over the bags, mark the words "hospital receipts" with seals, open up special areas for the deposit of sterilized banknotes, and ensure that no foreign payments are made.
专家提醒，在现金传递过程中可能会有人员接触，所以需要做好防护，养成使用现金后及时洗手等良好的用现习惯。
Experts warned that during the cash transfer process there may be personal contact, so need to do a good job of protection, after the use of cash, such as timely hand-washing good habits.
消费者可选择条码支付、刷卡支付等非现金支付工具方式，降低疫情传播风险。
Consumers can choose barcode payment, credit card payment and other non-cash payment means to reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic.
