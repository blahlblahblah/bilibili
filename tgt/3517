和社交平台上网友们直呼“太想念海底捞了”的热情相比，恢复堂食第一天的海底捞显得有些冷清。

2月，海底捞江苏常州一家海底捞门店传出曾有确诊病例用餐，此次再次开放堂食的海底捞对防疫工作格外谨慎。
In February, the bottom fishing in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, where confirmed cases were reported to have been dined, was particularly careful about epidemic prevention by reopening the canteen.
海底捞天虹店店员告诉界面新闻，目前所有门店只开放40%的区域，实行隔桌就坐，小桌仅坐1-2人，大桌坐2-4人，多人就餐需分桌。
At the moment, only 40 percent of all stores are open, with only 1-2 people sitting at a table, 2-4 people at a large table and tables for many people, the clerk at Tianyong told the Interface News.
这位店员称，除了正常的测温消毒程序，店员还提高了为消费者更换消毒热毛巾的频率。
In addition to the normal disinfection procedures, shop assistants have increased the frequency with which hot towels are replaced for consumers, the clerk said.
图片来源：张钦每张桌上立着“本台已消毒，请放心落座”的牌子，牌子背面标有“当天服务员姓名”和“当日体温”，同时每张桌都配有公勺公筷。

图片来源：张钦界面新闻从多家门店获悉，尽管几乎每家门店店员人数远超过落座的消费者，店员尚未全员复工，海底捞实行的是分批复工。
Source: Zhangqin Interface News learned from stores that although the number of shop assistants in almost every store far exceeds the number of sitting consumers, shop assistants have not yet returned to work at full capacity and seafarers are working in batches.
“此前好多加了微信的老顾客今天都来了，之前我1月10几号开始休假，休假到一半公司通知我暂时不能去上班了，我自己也是五十几天没吃火锅了。
"A lot of my older customers who had written letters came in today, and I was on holiday on the 10th of January and half the company told me I couldn't go to work for the time being, and I hadn't had a hot pot myself for fifty days.
”一位海底捞店员向界面新闻表达了自己复工的心情。
An undersea fisher told the Interface News how he was getting back to work.
该店员透露，在海底捞叫停堂食的46天中，公司发放的工资仅为保底数额。
The clerk said the company paid only a minimum wage during the 46 days it was fished up.
海底捞恢复堂食的消息，让不少投资者松了口气。
The news that undersea food had been restored was a relief to many investors.
昨日海底捞低调宣布营业消息后，股价随即逆市上涨1.18%至34.3港元，而在年前最后一个交易日（1月24日）的收盘价为每股29.7港元。
Shares rose 1.18 per cent to HK $34.3 yesterday after a low-key announcement, closing at HK $29.7 a share on the last day of the year.
然而，资本的热情很快消逝了，截止发稿今日海底捞股价较昨日收盘跌落5.96%至32.35港元，期间低见31.7港元。
However, the enthusiasm for capital fizzled out quickly, with undersea earnings falling 5.96 per cent to HK $32.35 from yesterday's close and a low of HK $31.7 during the period.
毕竟海底捞已喊停堂食整整46天，而门店堂食一直是海底捞最关键的收入来源。
After all, the bottom has been yelling for 46 days to stop eating, which has been the most crucial source of income for the bottom.
据中信建投此前发布研报，其判断疫情估计为海底捞2020年的营收带来损失约50.4亿元，归母净利润损失约为5.8亿元。
Citic Construction Investment Corp, which previously published a research paper, estimated the outbreak to be a loss of revenue of about $5.04 billion and a net profit of about $580 million for undersea fishing in 2020.
此前，该公司于1月26日至1月31日起暂停中国内地门店的营业，同时暂停外送服务。
The move follows the company's suspension of mainland Chinese stores from January 26 to January 31, as well as its outbound service.
2月2日，海底捞发布公告称，考虑到近期疫情发展情况，中国内地门店停业时间将会继续延长，直到昨日，经历了46天堂食业务暂停的海底捞终于宣布恢复门店营业。
On February 2, it issued a statement saying the shutdown would continue until yesterday, when undersea fishing, which saw 46 paradise food operations suspended, announced the resumption of shop operations.
以免现金流断档，海底捞也在闭店期间做起了限时外卖、生鲜社团配送和半成品饭菜生意。
To avoid cash flow disruptions, the bottom fishing also made time-limited take-out, fresh community distribution and semi-finished meals business during the closing period.
2月15日，尝鲜了社区团购配送的海底捞宣布恢复部分门店的外送业务，并将外送业务升级为无接触配送“安心送”，且暂不提供锅炉的租赁使和入户服务。
On 15 February, tasting community-purchased and distributed undersea fishing, the company announced the resumption of some of its stores' outsourcing operations and upgraded it to a "comfort of delivery" of non-contact distribution, with no provision for boiler leasing or door-to-door services.
3月3日，海底捞在海底捞App等多个电商平台上推出了自家的系列半成品菜“开饭了”。
On March 3, the bottom fishing at the bottom of the App and other electrical platforms launched their own series of semi-finished dishes "cooking."
但以上提及的自救措施并非是全面开放的，涉及的门店和城市都有限，更何况外送业务对海底捞而言只是杯水车薪。
However, the above-mentioned self-help measures are not fully open, involving a limited number of stores and cities, not to mention the fact that outsourcing is a small business for bottom fishing.
2019年上半年海底捞外卖营收1.88亿元，同比增长40.9%，在整体营业额中仅仅占比1.6%。
In the first half of 2019, undersea sales revenue was $188 million, an increase of 40.9 per cent year-on-year, accounting for only 1.6 per cent of total turnover.
光靠外卖业务显然无法支撑其正常发展。
The take-out business alone is clearly unable to sustain its normal growth.
不过好在2月22日，海底捞已从中信银行北京分行和百信银行获得信贷资金21亿元。
But on Feb. 22, the bank received 2.1 billion yuan in credit from Citic Bank Beijing and Paramount Bank.
此次合作，为后者主动接触，双方自2月12号开始商谈贷款相关事宜。
This cooperation, for the latter initiative contact, the two sides from February 12 start negotiations on loan-related matters.
