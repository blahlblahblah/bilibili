最后的战役已经打响，所有人都还需要站好最后一班岗刘以秦 | 文谢丽容 | 编辑解除隔离回家的武汉市民正在小区门口接受体温检查。
The final battle had begun, and everyone still needed to stand at the last post... Wenxieli rong & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
3月1日下午，慕江睿走出隔离酒店，外面是阴天，他却感觉看见了阳光。
On the afternoon of March 1, he walked out of the isolated hotel. It was cloudy outside, but he felt the sun shining.
他和父母三人在武汉火车站附近的城市便捷酒店隔离了11天，去酒店之前，已经自行在家隔离了11天。
He and his parents spent 11 days in a cityfriendly hotel near Wuhan railway station, isolated from their homes for 11 days before going to the hotel.
房间在二楼，打开窗户外面是一堵墙，看不见太阳，只能从天气预报和新闻里了解外面的情况，父母就住在隔壁，但也不能见面。
The room was on the second floor, outside the open window was a wall, the sun could not be seen, only from the weather forecast and the news, parents lived next door, but could not meet.
隔离期本应14天，由于体温正常，连续两次核酸检测均为阴性，他和母亲接到通知，可以回家了。
The isolation period was supposed to be 14 days and, with normal body temperature and negative nucleic acid tests on two consecutive occasions, he and his mother were informed that they could go home.
父亲还未接到可以解除隔离的通知，重见阳光还要几天。
The father had not been notified that the isolation would be lifted, and it would be several days before the sun shone again.
短短11天，这段日子有些恍惚。
In just 11 days, it was a bit of a trance.
2月7日，他的外婆因为感染被送到医院，直到2月17日去世也没见上最后一面。
On 7 February, his grandmother was taken to hospital with the infection and did not see her last face until her death on 17 February.
悲伤与隔离通知同时到来，他和父母属于“确诊患者密切接触者”，是“四类人员”之一。
Sadness came at the same time as quarantine notices, and he and his parents were in "close contact with confirmed patients," one of the "four categories."
慕江睿是这个酒店第一批解除隔离观察的人员。
Murray was one of the first to desegregate the hotel.
酒店离他家不远，十几分钟车程就能到。
The hotel is not far from his home. It is within ten minutes' drive.
社区书记在小区门口迎接，工作人员给他们量了体温，走进小区的封锁门，慕江睿回归到当下武汉居民的“正常生活”——可以出门拿快递、外卖，不能出小区。
The community secretary greeted them in front of the neighborhood, who took their temperature and walked through the cell's closed doors, returning to Wuhan residents' "normal life" - to get express delivery, take-out and not leave the district.
社区书记告诉《财经》记者，他们还有8位正在隔离的“密切接触人员”、30多例疑似病例以及十几名确诊正在住院的病人居民，接下来的主要工作就是从隔离点陆续接回他们。
The community secretary told Caijing that they also had eight "close contacts" in quarantine, more than 30 suspected cases and a dozen residents who were confirmed to be hospitalized, and that the next major task was to bring them back from the quarantine point.
从1月23日武汉封城开始，她一天都没休息过，经常熬夜没时间睡觉。
She hasn't had a day off since the city was closed on January 23, and often stays up too late to sleep.
回到社区的人们比去到医院的更多，这无疑是一个大好消息。
There are more people back in the community than there are going to the hospital, which is definitely good news.
武汉疫情蔓延终于得到了初步控制，3月2日，武汉累计确诊人数49315人，较前一天增加193人。
The spread of the epidemic in Wuhan has finally been brought under initial control. On March 2, a total of 49,315 people were diagnosed in Wuhan, 193 more than the previous day.

他的车上也安装了隔离防护膜，将司机与后排乘客隔离开。
His car was also fitted with a protective shield that insulated the driver from the passengers in the rear.
下午5点，慕江睿与母亲走出酒店，门口的工作人员给他们进行消毒，杜川还不放心，上车前，再次用酒精喷洒了一遍。
At 5 p. m., Murray and his mother went out of the hotel. The staff at the door disinfected them.

2月7日，慕江睿的外婆住进了武汉中南医院，随后又转到武汉市第三医院，这是他们所在的社区对口的定点医院，由于是确诊病人，家属不能探视，他们也不知道外婆后续治疗情况如何，2月17日，收到通知外婆去世。
On February 7, Mu Jiang Rui's grandmother was admitted to Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, and then transferred to Wuhan Third Hospital, the designated hospital of their community. As a result of the diagnosis, the family could not visit them and they did not know what the follow-up treatment was like.
来不及悲伤，慕江睿一家人就被送进了隔离点。
Too late to grieve, the Mujiang Rui family was sent to the quarantine point.
生活总是要继续。
Life is always going on.
作为一名在互联网公司上班的年轻人，工作离不开互联网，生活也离不开。

隔离的11天里，除了工作，别的时间他用来看电影，玩游戏。
During the 11 days of isolation, he used to watch movies and play games, except at work.
他的母亲的生活状态要无聊得多，她告诉《财经》记者，每天不知道要做什么，只能在酒店房间里来来回回地走，就当运动了。
His mother's life was much more boring, she told Caijing. She didn't know what to do every day, but walked up and down the hotel room as if she were exercising.
她说，“现在可以去阳台上晒晒太阳了。
"Now you can go out on the balcony and get some sun," she said.
”隔离酒店里，工作人员送来一天三餐，同时记录体温，住宿和吃饭的费用全免，午饭和晚饭都有3-4个菜，每顿都有肉，慕江睿评价，“吃得还是很好的。
In the isolated hotel, the staff delivered three meals a day while keeping track of body temperature, free of charge for lodging and eating. There were three to four dishes for lunch and dinner, each with meat.

The day before Mujiang Rui regained his freedom, another Wuhan-based Min Tang Fei left the cabin hospital and went into quarantine for 14 days.
