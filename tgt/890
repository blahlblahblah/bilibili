本报记者 王迎春 武汉报道在自己已经走过的生命中，张林（化名）从来没有像现在这样，期望从医院那里，拿到一张关于自己母亲的确诊单。
Our reporter Wang Yingchun Wuhan reported that in his own life, Zhang Lin (not his real name) has never expected from the hospital, a diagnosis of his mother.
原因很简单，因为他和他的家庭，就在武汉，而这座城市正处在一场由新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎而引发的旋涡当中。
The reason is simple, because he and his family are in Wuhan, a city caught in a whirlpool of pneumonia infected with the new coronavirus.
1月23日上午10点，武汉机场、火车站的离汉通道暂时关闭，何时重启，尚属未知。
January 23 10: 00 a.m., Wuhan airport, railway stations from the Han passage temporarily closed, when to restart, is still unknown.
但张林已经很难关心这些了。
But Zhang Lin already has difficulty caring about these.
他告诉《中国经营报》记者，几乎所有给他母亲看过病的医生，都曾向他口头告知，他母亲的各项检查表现与新型冠状病毒肺炎的表现一致。
He told China Business News that almost all the doctors who had shown his mother any signs of illness had told him orally that his mother's tests were consistent with those of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
然而，他仍然拿不到确诊通知。
However, he has still not been notified of the diagnosis.
这意味着，他的母亲无法入院治疗。
This meant that his mother could not be hospitalized.
张林的母亲，今年已经59岁了，截至记者发稿时止，他的母亲已经出现发烧症状14天了。
Zhang's mother, 59, had developed fever for 14 days by the time the story was published.
张林很理性。
Zhang Lin is very rational.
他从不认为医院是在刁难自己。
He never thought the hospital was making trouble for himself.
他告诉记者，14天来，他带着母亲跑遍了整个汉口的医院，但都被告知没有诊断使用的试剂。
He told reporters that for 14 days he had traveled with his mother to hospitals across Hankou, but was told there was no reagent for diagnosis.
“我不是为自己，武汉真的很缺医疗物资、缺医生、缺床位。
"I'm not for myself. Wuhan is really short of medical supplies, doctors and beds.
不仅患者、家属不容易，一线的护士、医生们也快崩溃，我不想宣泄自己有多么难，这对武汉并不好，但希望中央、全国其他地方尽快支援武汉。
Not only the patients, family members are not easy, the front-line nurses, doctors are also about to collapse, I do not want to vent how difficult, which is not good for Wuhan, but hope that the central and other parts of the country as soon as possible to support Wuhan.
”张林说。
"said Zhang Lin.
跑遍汉口被告知没有试剂张林59岁的母亲还没有得到医生的书面确诊，但14天以来，所有为他母亲看诊过的发热门诊专科医生均口头向张林明确，各项检查结果表现与新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊表现一致。
Hankou was told that no reagent Zhang Lin's 59-year-old mother had not been confirmed in writing by a doctor, but for 14 days all the fever clinic specialists who had visited his mother confirmed orally to Zhang Lin that the results were consistent with the diagnosis of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
“这就是确诊，但我们拿不到书面确诊单，因为最终确诊需要这种疾病的检测试剂，没有医生的书面确诊，我妈就不能被收治住院，14天以来，我跑遍整个汉口所有能去的医院，没有试剂！”他也向记者介绍，并非医院刁难，“床位全满了”。
"It was a diagnosis, but we couldn't get a written statement because we needed reagents to test for the disease, my mother couldn't be admitted without a doctor's written confirmation, and for 14 days I've been running through all the hospitals in Hankou without reagents!
14天跑下来，所有医院的发热门诊或呼吸感染科室都人满了，根本排不上号，更打不了针，张林最近常去的是武汉市红十字会医院。
14 days to run down, all the hospital fever clinic or respiratory infection departments are full, no number at all, not to mention the needle, Zhang Lin recently frequent the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital.
这家医院其他科室全部停掉，所有资源全部用于发热门诊。
All other sections of the hospital were closed and all resources were devoted to the fever clinic.
医院尽管调动了所有资源，然而还是各种“缺”，没有试剂、没有空床位，“走道都排满了人，整个医院人挤人。
Despite mobilizing all its resources, the hospital was "short" of reagents, empty beds, "corridors full of people, the whole hospital crowded.
”他说。
'he said.
不能住院隔离治疗，张林只好每天带着母亲前往医院排队。
Unable to be hospitalized for isolation, Zhang Lin had to take his mother to the hospital every day in line.
“前天晚上排了10多个小时，昨天打上针了。
"I've been queuing up for more than 10 hours the night before yesterday and got an injection yesterday.
”在与记者通话的整个过程中，张林始终克制，“还有人排了24个小时才打上针，我亲眼看到有患者真到被抢救之时，都没法住进病房，虽然医护人员全力抢救，但人还是说走就走了。
Throughout the conversation, Zhang restrained himself. "There were people who had to wait for 24 hours to get an injection, and I saw with my own eyes that there were patients who could not be admitted to the hospital room when they were really rescued.
我还亲眼看到两位正在排队的人晕倒，他们也没有办法住进病房。
I also saw with my own eyes two people standing in line fainting, and they couldn't get into the ward.
”不到37.3℃挂不到号“今天还去不去排队？”记者问张林。
"Less than 37.3 degrees Celsius can not hang the number" go to the queue today or not?
“今天不去了，医院没有那么多资源，门口贴了通知，患者体温如果在37.3℃以下挂不了号。
"Not today, the hospital did not have so many resources, the door posted a notice, the temperature of the patient if 37.3 degrees Celsius can not hang up.
”张林说。
"said Zhang Lin.
无法住进医院的病人怎么办？在家。
What about patients who cannot be hospitalized? At home.
谁来照顾？他的答案是家属自己照顾。
Who will take care of him? His answer is for the family to take care of themselves.
谁来保证家属的安全？张林沉默。
Who will ensure the safety of the family? Zhang Lin is silent.
“我作为儿子，必须的。
"I need it as a son.
”他说。
'he said.
没有换班的人，“多一个人照顾，多一份风险。
There is no shift, "one more person to take care of, more risk.
”他说。
'he said.
没有床位隔离，张林的母亲只好住在家里，一旦体温异常，张林就得带母亲去排队。
No bed isolation, Zhang Lin's mother had to live at home, once the temperature abnormal, Zhang Lin had to take his mother to the queue.
出门亦是一件不容易的事，没有交通工具，只能打车，“只能打出租车或叫滴滴车，车很少，有时平台无人接单。
It is not easy to get out, there is no means of transport, only take a taxi, "can only take a taxi or drip-drip cars, few cars, sometimes the platform unattended.
”他说。
'he said.
如果有紧张状况打120如何？“120也不能保证了，有患者打120，等了10分钟，还有人等了1个多小时。
120 "120 is no guarantee, 120 for a patient, 10 minutes for a patient, or more than an hour for someone to wait.
”他说。
'he said.
“那些没有车而又必须去医院的人是雪上加霜，他们怎么办？”他问。
"What do they do about people who don't have a car and have to go to the hospital?" he asked.
1月24日清晨，张林母亲出现呼吸困难，“妈妈说，算了，不治了，不想治了，死了算了。
Early in the morning of January 24, Zhang Lin's mother appeared breathing difficulties, "Mom said, forget, do not want to die, die forget.
”他说。
'he said.
困顿中的张林也曾收到广州、上海等地朋友帮助信息，有人要寄口罩，有人准备寄药品。
Trapped Zhang Lin has also received help from friends in Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places, someone to send masks, some ready to send medicine.
“没有用，交通都断了，个人寄的物资送不进去。
"It's no use, the traffic's broken, and personal supplies can't get in.
”他说。
'he said.
“医生也不容易，他们也想哭”在与记者的对话中，张林多次表示说出这一切，并非指责武汉，更不是指责那些没有收治他母亲的医院，“医生、护士非常不容易，我亲眼看到，医生超长时间上班，已经过了下班时候，还有源源不断的患者等待就诊，护士们一个个也累坏了，看得出，他们也想哭出来”。
"The doctors are not easy, they want to cry," Zhang said in a dialogue with reporters, not to blame Wuhan, not to mention those who did not treat his mother, "doctors, nurses are very difficult to see, I see the doctor working long hours, after work, there is a constant waiting for patients, nurses exhausted, it can be seen that they want to cry.
张林很无奈，只能自己做防护，所谓的防护也不过是戴上口罩而已。
Zhang Lin is very helpless, can only do their own defense, so-called protection is just wearing a mask.
但他没有灰心，身体还没生病，他的母亲需要他给予信心。
But he was not discouraged, he was not ill, and his mother needed his confidence.
“昨天吃年饭了吗？”记者问。
"Did you eat Spring Festival yesterday?" asked the reporter.
“这个已经不在乎了，我们一天吃两顿饭，不是舍不得，因为不能在外面吃给他人增加危险，只好自己做，还得跑医院，没时间吃饭。
"We don't care about that anymore. We can't afford to eat twice a day because we can't be too dangerous to eat outside, so we have to do it ourselves.
”他说。
'he said.
张林多次表示，之所以说这些不是为了博得人们对他个人遭遇的关注，而是想传递武汉整个疫情治疗的艰难状况，希望中央和其他地方能赶紧增援武汉。
Zhang said repeatedly that these are not to draw attention to his personal experience, but to convey Wuhan's entire treatment of the difficult situation, hope that the central and other places can hasten to reinforce Wuhan.
