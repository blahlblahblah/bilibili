澎湃新闻记者 李思文CT!……CT!……急需CT设备！2月初，国家卫健委发布《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎的诊疗方案（试行第五版）》，CT影像结果被纳入湖北省临床诊断标准中，“疑似病例具有肺炎影像学特征者”，即为临床诊断病例。
In early February, the State Health Council issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Programme for Pneumonia Infected by New Coronavirus (Trial Version 5), and CT imaging results were incorporated into the clinical diagnostic criteria of Hubei Province.
该方案一经发布，全国各省市医院CT扫描工作量激增，但伴随而来的，部分医院CT设备不足、缺少CT扫描技师、放射室易交叉感染等问题也亟待解决。
Once the program was released, the CT scan workload of provincial and municipal hospitals increased dramatically, but the problems of insufficient CT equipment, lack of CT scanners, and cross-infection of radiology rooms in some hospitals were also urgently needed.
“我们放射科每天都是轮班倒，扫描完患者再看片子，平均工作时长都要10多个小时。
"We in the radiology department work shift every day, scanning patients and then watching movies, the average working time is more than 10 hours.
”陈楠是安徽一新冠肺炎定点收治医院的放射科技师，由于新订购的CT设备尚未到位，新冠肺炎疑似及确诊患者仍需要前往原扫描室进行扫描，每次扫描后陈楠都需要进行终末消毒，工作量急剧增大。
"Chen Nan, a radiologist at Anhui's New Crown Pneumonia Targeted Hospital, said the suspected and confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia still needed to go to the original scan room for a scan, and after each scan Chen Nan had to undergo terminal disinfection.
与此同时，医疗企业CT设备订单量激增，许多企业春节期间仍继续生产，工人24小时轮班生产，目前仍是供不应求。
Meanwhile, orders for CT equipment at health-care companies have surged, with many businesses continuing to produce during the Spring Festival and workers running 24-hour shifts that are still in short supply.
在加速生产之余，部分企业也第一时间启动研发箱体式CT、远程诊断、人工智能辅助诊断等设备和技术助力抗疫。
In addition to accelerating production, some enterprises also first launched the development of box CT, remote diagnosis, artificial intelligence assisted diagnosis and other equipment and technology to help combat the disease.
CT扫描需求增大，企业设备订单激增2月14日情人节，陈楠在医院持续工作了将近12个小时，为了避免穿脱防护服，晚饭也没来得及吃，直到晚上10点多回家。
On February 14, Chen Nan worked for nearly 12 hours at the hospital. To avoid wearing protective clothing, she didn't have time to eat dinner until after 10 p. m. to return home.
随着新冠肺炎疑似病例的增加，陈楠等放射科医生的工作量也在与日俱增，从1月下旬开始，陈楠高强度的工作量已经持续超过20天。
The workload of radiologists such as Chen Nan is also increasing with the increase in suspected cases of new crown pneumonia, and Chen Nan's intense workload has continued for more than 20 days since late January.
“我们放射科属于辅助科室，很多人觉得我们不是抗疫一线，但实际上我们的危险性特别高，是要和患者直接接触。
"We in the radiology department are auxiliary departments, and many people think we're not on the frontlines of the epidemic, but in fact our risk is particularly high and we are in direct contact with the patient.
”陈楠说，自己所在的医院已经设置了发热门诊，但由于新订购的CT设备尚未到位，新冠肺炎收治病人仍需由护士带领前往放射科进行CT扫描。
Chen Nan said her hospital had set up a fever clinic, but since no new CT equipment had been ordered, nurses would still be required to take patients to the radiology department for CT scans.
每次在工作前，陈楠都需要穿上三层防护服、口罩、护目镜。
Every time before work, Chen Nan need to wear three layers of protective clothing, masks, goggles.
在扫描前，他要先进入扫描室进行病人摆位等操作，有些年纪大的病患，还需要动手协助病人进行摆位，“和病人的接触是无法避免的。
Before the scan, he had to go into the scan room to perform patient positioning and other procedures. Some older patients also needed to assist the patient in positioning.
”而在每次扫描后，为了避免交叉感染，陈楠要对整个扫描室进行终末消毒，包括空气消毒、设备消毒，“我们科室几个人连轴转，除了吃饭睡觉，就是扫描、看片子。
"And after each scan, to avoid cross-infection, Chen Nan had to end-disinfect the entire room, including air disinfection and equipment disinfection.
”陈楠说，时常会觉得身体无法负荷。
Chen Nan says she often feels overwhelmed.
据他了解，目前安徽省多数医院都面临着和他们一样的情况，新建了发热门诊，却缺乏CT设备、扫描技师轮班倒，“有的医院就是开通了新冠肺炎病人专门通道，和普通病人分开，但还是会有交叉传染的风险，有的医院像我们一样在购买新设备，但工厂生产不过来。
According to his information, most hospitals in Anhui Province now face the same situation. New fever clinics have been built, but CT equipment is lacking and scanners are working in shifts. "Some hospitals have opened special passages for patients with pneumonia, separate from ordinary patients, but are at risk of cross-infection.
”对此，东软医疗系统股份有限公司CEO武少杰告诉澎湃新闻，以往春节期间都是医疗设备销售的淡季，但今年由于疫情原因，各个医疗企业都接到了大量订单，确实存在供不应求的情况。
Wu Shaojie, CEO of Dongfang Medical Systems, told Pong Pai News that medical equipment sales had been slow during the Spring Festival, but this year medical companies were flooded with orders because of the epidemic, and there was a real shortage.
他介绍称，目前东软医疗已经向全国各地医院发货近百台CT设备，但仍有一百多个订单等待生产，其中大多数设备是用于各大医院的发热门诊。
He said the company had shipped nearly 100 CT devices to hospitals around the country, but more than a hundred orders were pending, most of which were for hot clinics in major hospitals.
“我们订单中很多都是三甲医院、传染病院，这些医院原本都配备了足够的CT放射室，但这次疫情爆发量大、患者也比较集中，很多医院都建立了专门的病区或发热门诊，原来配备的CT不能移动，也不能让普通病人和新冠肺炎疑似患者共同使用，所以都急需新的CT设备。
"Many of our orders are for triple-A hospitals and infectious disease hospitals, which were equipped with adequate CT radiology units, but the outbreak is large and the patients are concentrated. Many hospitals have set up special wards or fever clinics equipped with CT that cannot move or be shared by ordinary patients and suspected patients with pneumonia.
”武少杰说，由于订单紧急，公司已经成立应急指挥中心，尽快缩短供货时间。
Wu Shaojie said the company had set up an emergency command centre to shorten the delivery time as soon as possible because of the urgency of orders.
宁波的康达洲际医疗器械有限公司也收到了大量CT设备订单，“我们从小年夜就开始组织生产，已经发往武汉地区48台设备，发往全国其他地区60多台，但还有很多订单在抓紧生产。
Ningbo's Intercontinental Medical Device Co., Ltd. has also received a large number of CT equipment orders. "We have been organizing production since the beginning of the year and have sent 48 pieces of equipment to Wuhan and sent to more than 60 other parts of the country.
”该公司总经理郭咏梅说，为了加快生产，公司已经多增加一条生产线，并实施两班倒。
Guo Yongmei, the company's general manager, said the company had added an additional production line and implemented double shifts to speed up production.
医企紧急研发新设备，“黑科技”助攻抗疫在快速生产之余，部分医疗设备企业也在启动研发应对当前疫情的CT设备和辅助技术。
Medical enterprises are urgently developing new equipment, "black technology" auxiliary attack against epidemic In addition to rapid production, some medical equipment enterprises are also starting to develop CT equipment and assistive technology to deal with the current epidemic.
据上海联影医疗科技有限公司CT事业部副总裁胡玮介绍，在疫情发生后，公司在完成大量订单的同时，也第一时间启动了“方舱CT应急放射科”研发。
According to Hu Wei, vice-president of CT division of Shanghai Lianliang Medical Technology Co. Ltd., after the outbreak, the company completed a large number of orders, but also the first time to launch the "CT emergency radiology department.
“这是一台具备全智能工作流的天眼CT设备外加一种‘箱体式’设计的CT扫描间，采用类似集装箱的快速拆装设计，到了疫区经过短暂的安装过程就可以立即使用。
"This is a fully intelligent workflow with an eye CT plus a box-like CT scanner designed to be ready for immediate use after a brief installation process in an epidemic area," he said.
”胡玮说，目前“方舱CT应急放射科”主要是针对方舱医院，“因为很多方舱医院都建立在临时的室外场地，没有现成的房间能够满足CT放射室的要求，这套CT放射科解决方案就能很好地解决这个问题。
Mr. Hu said the current plan for emergency radiology on the square cabin was aimed at the hospital, saying many of the hospitals were built on temporary outdoor grounds and there were no rooms readily available to meet the demands of the CT radiology department.
”他告诉澎湃新闻，该项目经过研发后，2月4日投入生产，第一套方舱CT已经捐赠给武汉国展中心的方舱医院，2月16日正式投入使用。
He told the roar news that the project had been developed and put into production on February 4, and that the first set of CT capsules had been donated to the Wuhan National Exhibition Center's Fang Cao Hospital, which went into operation on February 16.
此外，联影医疗捐赠的另外9套“方舱CT应急放射科”也已经发往武汉，正在逐步搭建。
In addition, another nine sets of CT emergency radiology units donated by JIM have been sent to Wuhan and are being built gradually.
东软医疗系统股份有限公司也同时启动研发了“箱体式CT”，武少杰告诉澎湃新闻，该产品被称为“雷神CT”，设计该产品的初衷就是希望能够实现快速投入使用，支援疫区，“在这个与疫情比拼速度的关键时期，这个产品能实现无需安装、7日即可交付使用，大大缩短了生产和安装的时间。
Wu Shaojie told Peng Pai News that the product, called Thor CT, was designed to be used quickly to support epidemic areas. "In this critical period of fighting the epidemic, this product can be installed without installation, 7 days ready for use, greatly reducing production and installation time.
”目前，东软医疗研发的“雷神CT”已经正式交付“前线”。
At present, the research and development of "Thor CT" has been formally delivered to the "front line."
除了研发“箱体式CT”，隔离操作、远程诊断、人工智能辅助诊断也成为了研发的重点技术。
In addition to the development of "box CT," isolation operation, remote diagnosis, artificial intelligence assisted diagnosis has become the key technology.
胡玮说，目前联影的CT设备，包括“方舱CT应急放射科”，均已搭载了一套“天眼技术”，“以往进行CT扫描都需要医生进入扫描间进行患者摆位等操作，但依靠这个技术，可以通过智能摄像头和算法，让技师在操作室就能引导患者进行精准摆位和定位，能最大限度减少医生和患者的不必要接触，并确保扫描质量。
Mr. Hu said the group's current CT equipment, including the 'CT emergency radiology department', already features a 'skyeye technology' that 'used to require doctors to enter the scanner and perform patient positioning operations, but through smart cameras and algorithms, technicians can guide patients in the room, minimize unnecessary contact between doctors and patients, and ensure scan quality.
”人工智能辅助诊断也是医疗设备企业的研发重点，胡玮说，联影医疗子公司已经启动了针对新冠病毒的AI技术开发，“就是可以通过人工智能来进行辅助诊断，比如利用高敏感性的检测算法，能够检测到微小、不明显的疑似病灶，助力医生对疑似病例进行有效筛查、甄别。
Artificial intelligence-aided diagnosis is also a priority for medical-device companies, and Mr. Hu said the company has begun AI technology development for the new crown virus, 'that is, through artificial intelligence, such as using highly sensitive detection algorithms that can detect small, inconspicuous suspected lesions, and enabling doctors to screen and screen suspected cases effectively.
不仅如此，针对确诊病患，人工智能还能够进行分级评估，获得‘新冠肺炎严重指数’，对病人分诊提供帮助，同时给出科学有效的治疗方案，供医生诊断参考。
In addition, AI is able to rate patients, get the New Crown Pneumonia Severe Index, provide help for patient referrals, and provide scientific and effective treatment protocols for doctors to diagnose.
”胡玮介绍称，目前人工智能技术已经研发出新冠肺炎辅助诊断软件，在武汉火神山医院已经正式上线。
Mr. Hu said artificial intelligence technology had developed new software for diagnosing pneumonia and was officially on line at Wuhan's Fosen Mountain Hospital.
东软医疗在研发人工智能辅助诊断技术的同时，也在进行“5G+云技术”的探索。
While developing artificial intelligence aided diagnosis technology, Dongsoft Medical is also exploring "5G + Cloud Technology."
武少杰说，“5G+云技术”是一种远程诊断技术，目前部分医院面临医护资源不足的情况，使用远程诊断技术，就可以将医疗资源不足医院的CT扫描结果，通过实时传输数据，实现远程诊断，“这样外省市的放射科医生不用前往一线，就可以协助进行CT诊断，大大减轻一线医护人员的压力和工作量。
At present, some hospitals are facing a shortage of medical resources. Using remote diagnosis technology, it is possible to transmit CT scan results from hospitals with insufficient medical resources and realize remote diagnosis through real-time transmission of data.
”武少杰说，在这次疫情面前，医疗企业的研发人员都在加班加点进行新技术研发工作，“这次抗疫我感觉咱们国内的医疗设备企业确实成长很快，无论是响应速度、生产供货能力还是创新性，提升都非常快，大家在齐心协力地提供帮助，希望能共度难关。
"In the face of this epidemic, researchers at medical companies are working overtime to develop new technologies," said Wu. "I feel the medical equipment companies in our country are really growing very fast, both in terms of response time, production capacity and innovation.
