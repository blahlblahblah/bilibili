So far 1,723 passengers have been checked and 454 infected.
虽然邮轮上所有乘客和船员已被整体隔离，但确诊人数仍不断攀升。
Although all passengers and crew on the cruise ship have been isolated overall, the number of confirmed cases continues to rise.
据中国驻日本大使馆消息，邮轮上共有中国乘客300余人，其中内地居民22人，香港居民260人，澳门居民5人，台湾居民24人。
According to the Chinese Embassy in Japan, there were more than 300 Chinese passengers on board, including 22 mainland residents, 260 Hong Kong residents, 5 Macao residents and 24 Taiwan residents.
香港将安排包机接回“钻石公主”号乘客香港特区政府保安局15日晚表示，将安排免费包机接回在日本横滨“钻石公主”号上接受检疫的香港居民，在获准登岸后尽快返回香港。
Hong Kong will arrange chartered flights to pick up Hong Kong residents quarantined on board the Princess Diamond Jubilee and return to Hong Kong as soon as possible after receiving permission to disembark, the Security Bureau of the Hong Kong SAR Government said on Tuesday night.
香港特区政府将根据日本方面的安排，尽快通知受影响的香港居民。

为防止造成公共卫生风险，返港后相关人士将被安排入住检疫中心，接受14天隔离检疫。

香港感染及传染病医学会会长黄天佑16日表示，包机上最好安排每人座位有2米距离，乘客全程戴口罩和注意双手卫生，并安排有病征的人坐最后排。
The Hong Kong Society of Infectious Diseases and Infectious Diseases, Mr Wong Tian-yuk, said today (May 16) that it would be advisable to arrange a 2-metre-per-seat distance on charter flights. Passengers should wear face masks and observe good personal hygiene at all times.

According to the Security Bureau of the HKSAR Government, 21 Hong Kong residents were among the 21 confirmed cases on board the cruise ship as at 16.
美国、加拿大派包机接回本国乘客2月17日上午，两架接“钻石公主”号邮轮上美国公民回国的美国政府包机从东京羽田机场起飞。
US and Canada charter flights to take home U.S. passengers Two US government charters were chartered to take off from Tokyo's Haneda airport in the morning of Feb. 17 for the return of US citizens aboard the MV Princess Diamond.
17日凌晨，邮轮上约300名美国公民下船，乘坐日本自卫队提供的大巴到羽田机场登上包机。
In the early morning hours of the 17th, about 300 American citizens disembarked from the ship and boarded a charter flight at Haneda airport on a bus provided by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces.
两架包机分别飞往位于加利福尼亚州和得克萨斯州的美国空军基地，机上乘客将在这两个美军基地接受14天的隔离观察，以确认是否感染。
The two chartered flights were to US Air Force bases in California and Texas, where passengers were to be quarantined for 14 days to confirm infection.
另据日媒报道，邮轮上约有40名美国公民确认感染新冠病毒，这些人将留在日本进行治疗。
About 40 U.S. citizens confirmed they were infected with the virus and will remain in Japan for treatment, the newspaper said.
加拿大全球事务部（CGA）15日晚发表声明称，“之所以作出这一决定，是出于邮轮上的乘客面临特殊情况，以及为减轻日本医疗体系的负担”。
"The decision was made because of the special circumstances facing passengers on board and to ease the burden on Japan's health care system," Canadian Global Affairs (CGA) said in a statement late Tuesday.
声明中写道：“我们正在就撤离工作与嘉年华邮轮公司和日本政府紧密合作。
"We are working closely with Carnival Cruises and the Japanese government on the withdrawal," the statement said.
”声明还称，那些已经出现新冠肺炎感染症状的人员不得登机，会被转移到日本医疗系统接受治疗。
Those who have developed symptoms of pneumonia may not board the plane and will be transferred to the Japanese health-care system for treatment, the statement said.
此次包机接回的加拿大公民将被送至安大略省康沃尔郡的加拿大运输部训练所接受14天的隔离。
Canadian citizens brought back by the charter will be quarantined for 14 days at the Department of Transportation Canada Training Center in Cornwall, Ontario.
感染人数持续增长 或与邮轮结构有关“当务之急是让乘客离开邮轮，并让有需要的人得到对应的医疗援助。
The number of people infected continues to grow or is linked to the structure of the cruise ship "It is imperative that passengers leave the cruise ship and that those in need receive appropriate medical assistance."
”美国约翰·霍普金斯大学流行病学高级学者阿梅什·阿达利亚（Amesh Adalja）接受媒体采访时说，在邮轮等封闭空间内，人们居住的船舱相隔很近，通过呼吸道传播的传染病易在人群中散播。
In an interview with the media, Amesh Adalja, a senior epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the United States, said that in enclosed spaces such as cruise ships, people live in cabins so close that infectious diseases transmitted through the airways are easily spread among people.
据报道，整船隔离后，被感染者数量持续增高，可能和邮轮结构有关。
It has been reported that the number of infected people continued to increase after the ship was isolated, possibly due to the structure of the ship.
一般来说，邮轮多数舱室都是密闭的，内部通风由中央空调调节，包括外循环系统和内循环系统两种。
In general, most cabins on a cruise ship are airtight and internal ventilation is regulated by central air conditioning, including the outer circulation system and the internal circulation system.
前者通过连接在外的吸风口，吸进海洋上的空气后，再调节舱室内的温度。
The former inhale air from the ocean through a connected suction port, and then adjust the temperature in the cabin.
目前尚无法得知，“钻石公主”号是否及时打开外循环系统。
It is not known whether the Princess Diamond will open the outer circulation system in time.
日本厚生劳动大臣加藤胜信承认：“密闭空间或导致新一轮传染。
"Confined spaces or a new round of infections," admits Kato, Japan's health minister.
新病例的传染源已经不完全是那位80岁乘客。
The source of the new case is no longer the 80-year-old passenger.
有一些是由于在密闭空间里待了一段时间后，反复接触造成的。
Some are the result of repeated contact after spending some time in enclosed spaces.
”另据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）援引哈佛大学免疫学教授埃里克·鲁宾（Eric Rubin）的观点称，邮轮是一个封闭的环境，是传染病传播的理想场所。
According to Eric Rubin, a professor of immunology at Harvard University, which CNN quoted, cruise ships are a closed environment and ideal places for the spread of infectious diseases.
专家建议：将疑似病例、未发病人员分开隔离外交学院国际关系研究所教授、博导、日本研究中心副主任周永生分析称，继续实行船上隔离，可能会导致船上感染人群进一步扩大。
Experts recommend separating suspected and non-diseased people. Continuing ship-borne isolation could lead to a further increase in onboard infections, said Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the Diplomatic Academy and a mentor and deputy director of the Japan Research Center.
如此看来，船上隔离恐怕并非长久之计。
So shipborne isolation is not a long-term solution.
尽管日本政府对“钻石公主”号的所有乘客和船员进行了整体隔离，但没有对疑似病例和可能的潜伏病例，以及普通乘客和船员进行分别隔离。
Although the Japanese government has isolated all passengers and crew of the Princess Diamond, it has failed to separate suspected cases and potential latent cases, as well as ordinary passengers and crew.
在邮轮相对有限的空间中，如果要对3000多名乘客，或一半以上乘客实施分别隔离，显然是不现实的。
In the relatively limited space available for cruise ships, it is clearly unrealistic to segregate more than 3,000 passengers, or more than half of them.
因此，考虑将船上的疑似病例转移到陆地上的传染病医院进行隔离，将其他没有发病症状的人员分别在船上和陆地进行隔离，可能是最好的解决办法。
Therefore, it may be the best solution to consider transferring suspected cases on board ships to hospitals for the isolation of infectious diseases on land and to segregate other non-symptomatic persons on board ships and on land, respectively.
陆上隔离可以采取多种方式。
Isolation on land can take many forms.
首先可以选择在传染病医院进行隔离。
The first option is isolation in an infectious disease hospital.
如果传染病医院的房间和床位不足，则可临时租用远离人口密集地区的酒店进行隔离观察。
If rooms and beds in hospitals for infectious diseases are insufficient, hotels far from densely populated areas may be temporarily rented for isolated observation.
但要注意，在酒店临时隔离观察期间，要保证每个潜在感染者住在单独的房间中，并且不能相互走动。
Be aware, however, that during temporary confinement in the hotel, each potential infected person should be kept in a separate room and not allowed to move about.
只有严密防护的医护人员或服务人员可少量流动，以避免交叉感染。
Only closely guarded medical staff or service personnel may move in small quantities to avoid cross-infection.
采取上述措施，既有助于防止“钻石公主”号上乘客和船员交叉感染的病例继续增多，也有助于防止疫情在日本境内扩散。
These measures will both help to prevent further cases of cross-infection between passengers and crew on board the Princess Diamond, and to prevent the spread of the disease in Japan.
