现在校园里还没有人戴口罩，但国内的亲人总是打电话说美国疫情严重，出门一定要戴口罩，这让他非常为难。
No one on campus is wearing masks yet, but he is embarrassed that relatives at home are calling to say the United States has a serious epidemic and must wear masks when they go out.
文｜李　莹今年春节，我到美国旅游，结果因为新冠肺炎疫情，回程航班被取消了……一言难尽。
less than one + less + less than + less than + less than + + As a result of the Spring Festival, my return flight was cancelled due to the new crown pneumonia.
这是我滞留美国的第42天，西雅图已经有学校因新冠疫情停课。
This is the 42nd day of my stay in the United States, Seattle has a school due to the new crown epidemic.
我去斯坦福大学体验了一天，看看校园内是否受到新冠疫情的冲击。
I went to Stanford University for a day to see if the campus was affected by the new crown.
斯坦福大学是世界著名私立研究型大学，与哈佛大学、麻省理工学院齐名，占地面积在美排名第六，光校内班车线路就有5条以上，优秀学子更是遍布世界500强公司。
Stanford University is one of the world's leading private research universities, alongside Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), occupying sixth place in the United States.
校园中学生们基本以自行车代步，来往于各个学院。
Schoolchildren on campus are basically bicycling to and from colleges and universities.
午间，我来到学生食堂，见各层楼梯处已经放置了泡沫消毒液，观察了一下使用率约50%。
At noon, I came to the student canteen and saw that foam disinfectant had been placed on the stairs and observed the usage rate of about 50 per cent.
一楼公众区域里不乏亚洲面孔，没想到在外国这么容易辨认，因为在这个平均气温约12度的季节，美国人基本长短T，而亚洲面孔的人会穿超薄羽绒服。
There is no shortage of Asian faces in the public area on the ground floor, which is not easily recognizable in a foreign country, as Americans wear a basic length of T in a season with an average temperature of about 12 degrees, while Asian faces wear ultra-thin down jackets.
学工程技术专业的中国留学生胡同学表示，现在校园里还没有人戴口罩，但国内的亲人总是打电话说美国疫情严重，出门一定要戴口罩，这让他非常为难。
No one on campus is wearing masks yet, but he is embarrassed that relatives at home are calling to say the United States has a severe epidemic and must wear masks, according to engineering major Hutong-Hutong.
因为在美国人的传统观念里，通常只有病人才戴口罩。
Because in traditional American practice, only patients usually wear masks.
如果你外出戴着口罩，就像是向路人宣告我正在生病，而生了病还要出门转悠，那意味着传播疾病的风险，这样的人会被别人致“侧目礼”。
If you go out wearing a mask, it's like announcing to a passer-by that I'm sick and you're going out and forth. That means you're at risk of spreading the disease.
美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）始终建议，没有染病的人无需戴口罩。
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been advising people who are not infected to wear masks.
然而，中国的抗疫经验，感染病毒的人在潜伏期也是可能传染的，而且还可能会出现无症状的感染者，所以我们中国人认为大传染时期要求民众在公共场所戴口罩，是利大于弊的。
However, China's experience of the epidemic, infected people during the incubation period may also be infectious, and there may be asymptomatic infected people, so we Chinese people think the pandemic period in public to require people to wear masks, is more pros than disadvantages.
胡同学说，虽然在校内不必戴口罩，但还是想买一些口罩以防万一。
Hutong theory, although the school does not have to wear a mask, but still want to buy some masks in case.
可近一周来，美国口罩价格飞涨，3M的N95口罩价格涨了6-10倍，而一盒50片装一次性医用口罩价格涨了近15倍，还奇货可居，同学们笑谈只能去跟油漆店搞好关系，预订平价N95口罩了。
But over the past week, prices have skyrocketed for 3M N95 masks, while the cost of a 50-piece disposable mask has risen nearly 15-fold, making students laugh and order a cheaper N95 mask.
急救用品、卫生用品销量猛增前两天还听到一个故事，某银行华裔雇员接待了春节到美的武汉籍客户，第二天她就有点咳嗽症状，吓得她赶紧去斯坦福医院检查。
There was a story two days ago about a Chinese employee of a bank who received a Wuhan customer for the Spring Festival holiday. The next day she developed symptoms of coughing and rushed to Stanford Hospital to check on her.
她告知医生曾接触武汉来客时，医院马上“警铃大作”，医生、护士换上防化服来给她进行一项项检测。
When she told her doctor that she had been in touch with Wuhan visitors, the hospital immediately "alarm work," doctors, nurses put on a chemical-proof clothes to give her a test.
“有个管子直接从鼻子插进去真难受啊，但更难受的是我收到了12000元的账单！”虽然后来证明是虚惊一场，保险公司也承担了大部分费用，但这天价账单也显示出美国另一个世纪大难题——医保可能成为控制疫情蔓延的最大绊脚石。
"It's hard to get a pipe straight through my nose, but what's more, I got a $12,000 bill!" Although it turned out to be a fake and the insurance company bore most of the cost, the sky-high bill also showed that health care, another big problem of the century, could be the biggest stumbling block in containing the epidemic.
美国有大约10%的人是没有医保的，虽然总统特朗普在周五上午签署了国会通过的紧急抗疫拨款法案，批准拨款83亿美元用于疫情防控，但按副总统彭斯在新闻发布会中所说，“让每个美国人都能接受核酸检测”，一切与新冠肺炎检测相关的费用，将由医保承担。
In the United States, about 10% of the population is uninsured, and while President Trump signed the congressional Emergency Appropriations Act on Friday morning, approving $8.3 billion for disease control, as Vice President Burns said at a press conference, "every American can be tested for nucleic acids" and all the costs associated with a new crown pneumonia test will be borne by Medicare.
而这10%医保以外的人，他们呢？是否能获得免费检测不得而知。
And what about the 10% of people not covered by Medicare, whose access to free testing is not known.
这部分人很多是没有固定职业，甚至无家可归的，他们的生存环境致使他们染病率更高，还有那些“黑”在美国的人，就更是危险了，他们即使生病也不愿意去医院，这些都有可能成为移动的传染源。
Many of these people are unemployed or homeless, and their living environment leads to higher rates of illness, especially among those in the United States, who are reluctant to go to hospitals even in the event of illness, which can be a source of infection.
超市里一些饮用水货架被搬空今天全球的确诊病例已突破10万例，美国的疫情也在蔓延，特别是华盛顿州，现在确诊病例已经有80例，13例死亡，美国华盛顿大学研究新冠病毒疫情的专家Trevor Bedford在接受美国媒体STAT采访时说：“3月1日的西雅图，就是1月1日时的武汉”。
"Seattle, March 1, is Wuhan on January 1," Trevor Bedford, a New Crown Virus expert at the University of Washington, told US media STAT. "Seattle, March 1, is Wuhan on January 1.
一些美国知名大企业在当地的雇员也被先后确诊：其中亚马逊有一名员工被确诊，微软有两名员工被确诊，脸书一名在其西雅图办公室工作的承包商被确诊……因此，包括亚马逊、谷歌、脸书和微软这些高科技公司在西雅图有办公室的，都已经要求员工在家远程办公。
Local employees at some of America's biggest companies have also been diagnosed: one Amazon employee was diagnosed, two Microsoft employees were diagnosed, and a Facebook contractor working in its Seattle office was diagnosed... Thus, high-tech companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft that have offices in Seattle already require telecommuting from home.
漫步在美丽的斯坦福大学校园，完全感觉不到疫情对美国学生的影响，普通民众也认为这场疫情可能只是另一场“流感”，究竟是美国人更为“理性”,还是他们心太大，只有时间能证明。
Walking around the beautiful Stanford campus, totally unaware of the impact of the epidemic on American students, ordinary people agree that the epidemic may be just another "flu," whether Americans are more "rational" or whether they have too much in mind to prove it.
