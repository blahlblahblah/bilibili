中国当前对贸易的依赖程度降低了，也做好了在大型冲击之下实现反弹的准备。
China is now less dependent on trade and ready to rebound from big shocks.
其中一个被低估了的力量来源，则是中国数字经济的迅速发展，这一点可以极大提升中国经济的韧性文/迈克尔·斯宾塞2019年12月，发端于中国武汉的2019新型冠状病毒病已经夺去了数千人的生命，同时改变了数亿人的日常生活轨迹，并将整个世界推到了灾难边缘。
One of the underrated sources of power is the rapid growth of China's digital economy, which can greatly enhance the resilience of the Chinese economy. / Michael Spencer In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease that originated in Wuhan, China, claimed thousands of lives, changed the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people and pushed the world to the brink of disaster.
由于流行病学家尚未完全识别出病毒的传播机制，因此，无人能确定何时才能控制整个疫情，更别提其经济影响了。
Since epidemiologists have not yet fully identified the transmission mechanism of the virus, no one can say for sure when the entire outbreak will be contained, let alone its economic impact.
但这并不意味着我们可以毫无根据地胡乱猜测。
But that does not mean that we can speculate without foundation.
历史经验表明，那些类似大型冲击性事件对短期经济的损失可能相当大。
Historical experience has shown that short-term economic losses from events such as large-scale shocks can be considerable.
随着投资者着手调低自身投资组合的风险值，市场波动也就不出所料了，而那些被认为具有最大风险敞口的行业——比如旅游业、奢侈品、汽车——自然首当其冲。
As investors set out to lower the risk values of their portfolios, market volatility will come as no surprise, and industries deemed to have the greatest exposure - such as tourism, luxury goods, and automobiles - will bear the brunt.
多个公共部门和私人部门做出的可靠估算表明，在该病毒疫情到达拐点之前，中国的年度GDP增长可能会在每季度都遭遇2%-4%的损失。
A number of reliable estimates from the public and private sectors suggest that annual GDP growth in China could suffer a quarterly loss of 2-4 per cent before the virus reaches the inflection point.
消费和生产两方面都将受到打击，这主要来自于自愿或强制的流动性限制措施，而以往因农历新年假期产生的波动则可以忽略不计了。
Both consumption and production will be hit, mainly as a result of voluntary or mandatory liquidity restrictions, while previous fluctuations due to Lunar New Year holidays have been negligible.
那么，问题就在于拐点何时才能到来。
The question, then, is when the inflection point will arrive.
一些比较乐观的预测认为，今年第二季度将有所恢复，但我觉得期望第三季度复苏并对全球年度增长产生实质影响会比较现实。
Some of the more optimistic forecasts are for a recovery in the second quarter of this year, but I think it would be realistic to expect a recovery in the third quarter with a real impact on annual global growth.
此外，也不能排除因企业倒闭、就业下降、私人投资放缓以及政策反应过弱/迟缓，而导致的疫情扩大对经济造成更大范围破坏的可能性。
Moreover, the possibility of wider damage to the economy as a result of the expansion of the epidemic through business closures, declining employment, slowing private investment and weak / slow policy responses cannot be ruled out.
除非真出现上述“黑天鹅”事件，否则历史经验表明，新型冠状病毒对中国经济的长期影响可能相当微小，甚至可以忽略不计。
Unless the "black swan" event does occur, historical experience suggests that the long-term impact of the new coronavirus on China's economy could be small, if not negligible.
这种情况更有可能发生，因为中国的经济还算不上脆弱。
This is more likely because China's economy is not yet fragile.
事实上，与2003年爆发SARS时相比，中国当前对贸易的依赖程度降低了，同时也做好了在大型冲击之下实现反弹的准备。
Indeed, China is now less dependent on trade than it was when SARS erupted in 2003, and is poised to rebound from a major shock.
其中一个被低估了的力量来源，则是中国数字经济的迅速发展。
One of the undervalued sources of power is the rapid growth of China's digital economy.
如今，中国35.3％的零售行为在互联网上进行；移动互联网普及率极高并且还在不断上升；而中国的移动支付系统也是世界上最先进的。
Today, 35.3 per cent of China's retail activity is conducted on the Internet; mobile Internet penetration is high and rising; and China's mobile payment system is among the most advanced in the world.
由于大多数人和企业都实现了联网且活跃于线上，因此，很容易生成大量数据，并借助人工智能立即扩展数字生态系统的覆盖范围和效能。
Because most people and businesses are networked and active online, it is easy to generate large amounts of data and use artificial intelligence to immediately expand the reach and effectiveness of digital ecosystems.
这一点可以极大提升中国经济的韧性，尤其是在某些危机限制了个人行动的情况下。
This can greatly enhance China's economic resilience, especially if certain crises limit individual action.
先进的数字基础设施，意味着许多岗位和行业的劳动者即使被隔离或封锁，也可以继续在家工作。
Advanced digital infrastructure means that many workers in jobs and industries can continue to work from home even if they are segregated or blocked.
而发展成熟的在线教育平台，也许能够抵消学校停课带来的部分影响。
The impact of school closures may be partly offset by the development of a fully developed online education platform.
此外，对于那些遭遇现金流和营运资本挑战的企业，贷款机构可以远程实现信贷延展和条款调整——这将在最大程度上减少对服务部门尤其是中小企业的长期损害。
Moreover, for firms facing cash-flow and working capital challenges, lending institutions can remotely extend credit and adjust terms - which would minimize long-term damage to the services sector, especially SMEs.
在线保险产品也可以扩展到包括健康在内的多个领域；在线订购医疗用品可能会避免因危机引起的短缺，因为算法可以快速发现并应对堵塞和瓶颈；在线平台可以极大地抵御乘人之危的价格欺诈，因为这些行径限制了人们（尤其是那些最脆弱群体）获取基本商品和服务的能力，比如亚马逊网上购物商城就警告卖家不得以过高价格销售口罩，一旦违反就可能被平台关店。
Online insurance products can also be extended to a variety of areas, including health; online ordering of medical supplies may avoid crisis-induced shortages, as algorithms can quickly detect and address congestion and bottlenecks; and online platforms can be extremely resistant to risky price frauds that limit access to essential goods and services, such as Amazon's online shopping mall, which warns sellers not to sell masks at exorbitant prices.
随着越来越多的经济份额被引入线上，跟踪其绩效也因此变得更加容易、快捷和精确。
As an increasing share of the economy is brought online, tracking its performance becomes easier, faster, and more accurate.
此类数据可用于调整政策响应并提高预测的准确性，进而有助于增强企业信心，鼓励投资并加速复苏。
Such data can be used to adjust policy responses and improve the accuracy of forecasts, which in turn can help increase business confidence, encourage investment and accelerate recovery.
而对于世界其他地区来说，旅游业将面临巨大的负面冲击，即便是那些疫情影响轻微的国家也无法幸免。
For the rest of the world, the negative impact on tourism will be enormous, even for countries with a low impact.
在中国拥有庞大业务的企业（例如汽车和奢侈品领域）都可能遭受打击，它们可能会与中国经济同时复苏。
Companies with big operations in China, such as cars and luxury goods, are likely to be hit and likely to recover along with the Chinese economy.
就算新冠病毒疫情能在短时间内得到遏制，这场危机也可能会加快各方将全球供应链的关键环节转移出中国的脚步。
Even if the outbreak of the new cap virus is contained in a short time, the crisis could accelerate the shift of key links in global supply chains away from China.
这一进程在中国的比较优势从廉价劳动密集型生产向高附加值交易活动转变的推动下，已经进行了数年。
This process has been taking place for several years, driven by a shift in China's comparative advantage from cheap labor-intensive production to higher value-added trading activities.
中美之间的贸易紧张局势加剧了这一趋势，病毒则提供了额外的驱动力。
Trade tensions between China and the US have exacerbated this trend, with the virus providing an additional driver.
然而，与中国在全球价值链中的地位相比，更重要的是我们要认识到全球供应网络已经过度紧绷且缺乏弹性，但目前尚不清楚新冠病毒疫情的爆发能否激发出一些改变。
However, compared to China's position in global value chains, it is more important to recognize that global supply networks have become overly stretched and inelastic, but it is unclear whether the outbreak of the new crown virus will inspire some change.
毕竟这也是2011年日本大地震和海啸的教训，当时造成了福岛第一核电站事故，并扰乱了全球供应链。
After all, that was the lesson of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which caused the Fukushima Daiichi accident and disrupted global supply chains.
一些人预计，新冠病毒疫情会对中国政府的信誉造成损害，但这似乎不太可能。
Some expect the outbreak to damage Beijing's credibility, but that seems unlikely.
尽管在初期有所延迟，但当局最终还是采取了果断行动。
Despite initial delays, the authorities eventually took decisive action.
整个操作可能并不完美，但在这样的大危机中，其实没什么极好的选项，也无法保证所选的措施一定奏效。
The whole operation may not be perfect, but in a crisis like this, there are no great options, and there is no guarantee that the measures chosen will work.
尽管如此，中国领导人还是要吸取教训。
Nonetheless, China's leaders need to learn their lesson.
其中比较显著的一点就是，客观且自下而上的信息对于及早发现和响应至关重要。
Notably, objective and bottom-up information is essential for early detection and response.
中国也很可能在危机得到遏制后采取措施，确保该系统将来不会阻塞或过滤此类信息流。
China is also likely to take steps to ensure that the system does not block or filter such flows in the future once the crisis is contained.
新型冠状病毒疫情的各类尾部风险极为巨大且令人生畏，但到目前为止它们似乎不太可能成为现实，尤其是在孜孜不倦、积极进取且不断调整的中国国内和国际对策持续涌现的情况下。
The tail risks of the new coronavirus outbreak are enormous and daunting, but so far they do not seem likely to become a reality, especially given the emergence of a tireless, aggressive and ever-changing domestic and international Chinese response.
相反疫情的经济后果虽然重大，但很可能只是暂时的。
On the contrary, the economic consequences of the epidemic, while significant, are likely to be temporary.
唯一无法弥补的，则是那些逝去的生命。
The only irretrievable are the lives that have passed away.
