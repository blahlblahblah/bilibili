毛蜜娜/华商网3月2日起，西安市17个婚姻登记处已正常上班，逐步恢复婚姻登记办理工作。
Since March 2, 17 marriage registration offices in Xi'an have been operating normally, gradually resuming the work of marriage registration.
华商报记者5日从多个已经恢复业务办理的婚姻登记处了解到，相比于新人结婚的迫切愿望，离婚的人也不在少数，多个婚姻登记处离婚预约天天爆满。
China Merchants News reported on the 5th from a number of marriage registration offices have resumed business, compared to the new marriage eager to divorce more than a few people, many marriage registries are full of divorce appointments every day.
工作人员提醒市民，疫情期间在家产生矛盾可以理解，但婚姻大事必须谨慎，切莫因为一时冲动轻易离婚。
Staff reminded the public that conflicts at home during the outbreak are understandable, but marriage must be handled with caution and not be easily divorced on impulse.
一天14对预约离婚 达当日离婚预约上限3月5日是“学雷锋日”，往年只要赶上个啥节日，碑林区民政局婚姻登记处就会排起长队。
March 5 is Lei Feng Day. As long as there is a special day, there will be a long queue at the Civil Affairs Bureau Marriage Registry in the stele forest area.
可是，5日这里空荡荡的，没有人排队，大厅里也没有等待办理结婚的市民，这是为什么呢？工作人员王女士告诉华商报记者，根据民政部的要求，在疫情防控期间，西安市婚姻登记办理工作实行“网上预约、错峰登记”制度,婚姻登记办理全部实行网上预约，按照先预约后办理的程序进行。
However, no one queued up here on the 5th, and there was no waiting in the lobby for the wedding, so why? Ms. Wang told the China Business Daily that, at the request of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the registration of marriages in Xi'an was based on online booking and staggered peak registration.
“这个消息是3月1日下午发出的，3月2日开始我们就接到了一些电话预约，3-4日预约办理的人逐渐多了起来，5日是这几天以来最多的，结婚预约达到了28对。
"The announcement came on the afternoon of March 1, and since March 2 we have received some telephone appointments," he said. "The number of appointments on March 4th has gradually increased, reaching 28 on the 5th.
”王女士说，按照疫情防控的要求，他们会提前一天和要来办理业务的市民进行电话沟通，约好前来办理的时间，精确到几点几分，“一般办理一对登记的间隔是半小时到40分钟，除了办理业务，还要流出消毒的时间，按照规定，办理业务的市民互相不见面，不聚集，所以现在是不会出现排队或在大厅等候的情况。
"As required by the epidemic prevention and control, they will make phone calls to prospective customers one day in advance to make an appointment for a few minutes." The average interval between registration and registration is between half an hour and 40 minutes.
”同时华商报记者了解到，3月5日当天，碑林区民政局婚姻登记处的离婚的预约是14对，已经达到了当日离婚预约的上限，“昨天离婚预约也是满的，今天也一样，”王女士说，“以往每年也是会在过年之后、高考之后，出现离婚小高峰，今年受疫情影响，许多夫妻在家整整一个月，容易产生矛盾，加上之前因为疫情业务一直无法开展，所以这几天，明显能感觉到办理离婚的人数激增。
On March 5, the number of divorces at the Civil Affairs Bureau's Marriage Registry in Tableforest District was 14, meeting the daily ceiling for divorce appointments. "Yesterday was full, and so was it today," Wang said.
”离婚登记已经预约到18日和碑林区情况类似，雁塔区民政局婚姻登记处这两天预约离婚的人数也是天天爆满，工作人员韩女士告诉华商报记者，疫情期间，她们也是通过先预约再办理的方式来开展工作的，“最近前来办理的市民都需要经过扫码、测温等环节，每一对办完之后，我们还需要做消杀工作，根据办理时间的测算，最近我们每天接受的预约是22对左右，其中结婚在16-17对，离婚每天有5对的名额。
Han told the China Business Daily that during the outbreak, they also had to go through the pre-registration and temperature check-up process. "According to the latest estimates, we have about 22 bookings per day, including 16-17 couples and 5 divorces per day," Han told China Business Daily.
”韩女士说，这几天离婚预约是每天爆满的，而且离婚预约已经排号排到了18日，的确是出现了一个小高峰。
Ms Han said the days of divorce appointments were packed daily, and the number of divorce appointments was set at 18, a small peak indeed.
在高新区民政局婚姻登记处，记者了解到，高新区目前可以办理七天内的婚姻登记预约，根据预约的情况，未来七天的结婚、离婚都已经约满了。
At the Civil Affairs Bureau marriage registration office in the high-tech district, the reporter learned that the high-tech district can now make an appointment for marriage registration within seven days, according to the appointment, the next seven days of marriage, divorce has been contracted.
工作人员孙女士说：“我们每天可以预约11对结婚，4对离婚，预约业务开展以来，每天都是预约满员的情况。
"We can book 11 marriages every day, 4 divorces and every day since the appointment booking process," said Sun.
”谈及离婚人数显著增长的原因，韩女士说：“一部分是因为前段时间积压了一些存量，还有一部分就是受疫情影响，在家里时间太久，夫妻间产生矛盾，冲动离婚。
Asked why the number of divorces has risen sharply, Ms. Han said: "It's partly because of the build-up of some stocks in the past period, partly because of the epidemic, too long at home, conflicts between couples and impulsive divorce.
我们实际办理中也遇到一部分人，网上预约了离婚，到电话联系时，又说不离了。
We actually deal with a part of the people, online booking for divorce, to the telephone contact, and said not to leave.
我们还是希望大家慎重再慎重，不要因为一时冲动，造成一生的遗憾。
We still hope that we are careful, not because of the impulse, resulting in a lifetime of regret.
”有人刚办完离婚又去复婚碑林区婚姻登记处的王女士说，5日碑林区婚姻登记处就遇到了一对年轻人，来办理离婚业务，两个人到婚姻登记处还是笑呵呵的，男孩问女孩“到底办不办”，女孩说“你说办就办呗”。
Ms. Wang, who had just got a divorce and went to the marriage registration office, said on the fifth day the Tableforest Marriage Registry had met a couple of young people to handle the divorce business.
“看到这样的情况，我就赶紧劝了几句，让小伙子大度一点，不要为了一些小事，就来离婚。
"Seeing this, I quickly advised a few words, so that the young man magnanimous, do not for some small things, to divorce.
婚姻大事，岂能当儿戏？结果两个人犹豫了一会儿，还是决定办离婚。
How could marriage be a joke? The two men hesitated for a moment and then decided to get a divorce.
我一看也劝不住，就按照程序给办理了。
As soon as I could not persuade, I followed the procedure.
没想到就在离婚证都要打印好的时候，俩人又后悔了，问能不能不离了？这时候离婚手续基本已经办好了，只能是让他们去办理复婚了。
The divorce papers had to be typed out, and the couple regretted it and asked if they could not leave the marriage.
就这样，两个年轻人刚办完离婚，又开始办理复婚手续。
In this way, just after the divorce, two young people began to resume the marriage formalities.
”王女士提起这件事情，有些无奈。
"Ms. Wang was somewhat helpless to mention it.
