The collegial panel of the Jinshan court said Li had committed the crime of obstructing the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and sentenced him to one year and three months of probation.
上海市金山区人民检察院指控，2020年1月23日，被告人李某已在武汉市居住3日，知道即将封城的消息之后回沪。
The Shanghai Golden Mountain People's Procuratorate charged that on January 23, 2020, defendant Li Mou had lived in Wuhan city for 3 days and returned to Shanghai after learning of the impending ban.
回沪后，被告人李某在新冠肺炎疫情期间，隐瞒武汉旅行史，多次乘坐公共交通工具，出入公共场所。
After returning to Shanghai, defendant Li concealed Wuhan travel history during the outbreak of Xinguan Pneumonia and travelled to and from public places by public transportation on many occasions.
该男子出现症状并在医院就诊时，不仅继续隐瞒武汉旅行史，还在输液室密切接触多人，最终致55名密切接触者（其中包括上海市第六人民医院金山分院医护人员11名）被隔离，造成按照甲类传染病防控的新冠肺炎传播严重危险，危害公共卫生安全，损害社会公共利益。
When the man presented symptoms and went to the hospital, he not only kept Wuhan travel history hidden, but also had close contact with many people in the infusion room, which eventually isolated 55 close contacts, including 11 medical staff of Jinshan Branch Hospital of the Sixth People's Hospital in Shanghai.
因此，金山区检察院建议判处被告人一年三个月，适用缓刑。
Therefore, the Golden Mountain Prosecutor's Office recommended that the defendants be sentenced to one year and three months, with suspended sentences.
在法庭上，被告人李某当庭表示，非常后悔没有遵循新冠肺炎的防疫要求，私自外出并隐瞒武汉居住史，为了弥补自己的过失，愿意捐献血浆给其他需要的患者。
In court, defendant Li said that he regretted not to comply with the requirements for immunization of the new crown pneumonia, went out and hid Wuhan residence history, in order to make up for their mistakes, willing to donate plasma to other patients in need.
公诉人认为，被告人李某有三类行为违反防疫措施，其中包括签署承诺书后继续多次外出，就诊时隐瞒湖北旅行史。
Prosecutors said Li had committed three types of violations of the epidemic prevention measures, including signing a commitment to continue to go out many times, medical treatment when Hubei travel history.
也因隐瞒武汉旅行史，导致居委会不清楚被告人的真实情况，医院没有采取相应的防护措施和审慎的诊疗方案，最终造成55名医护人员和就诊患者被隔离。
As a result of the concealment of Wuhan travel history, the neighborhood committee did not know the true situation of the accused, the hospital did not take appropriate protective measures and prudent medical treatment programmes, resulting in the isolation of 55 medical personnel and patients.
“被告人为了一己之便，罔顾公共安全，为上海防疫带来巨大的隐患。
"The defendant, for his own sake, ignored public security and caused great danger to epidemic prevention in Shanghai.
被告人违反传染病防疫法规定，涉嫌妨害传染病防治罪。

即使到现在，并不能因防控形势有所好转而姑息违法行为。

"But after the defendant arrives at the case and confesses the true circumstances of the crime, he signs a confession statement and can be given a lighter penalty according to law.
”被告人辩护律师则表示，每个人对新冠肺炎的认识有一个认识的过程，起初被告人李某没有其他症状，只是没有胃口，以为只是普通感冒，因此才对自身感染的状况疏忽大意。
Defence lawyers for the defendants said everyone had a process of understanding the condition of pneumonia, and the defendant, Li Mou, had no other symptoms at first but had no appetite and thought it was just a common cold, so he was negligent in his infection.
但被告人李某去医院时全程佩戴口罩，去超市药店也是解决生活必需品需求，并不是溜达闲逛，且被告人认罪态度良好。
However, the accused Li went to the hospital wearing a mask, to the supermarket pharmacy is also to meet the needs of life necessities, not wandering around, and the accused admitted to a good attitude.
同时，被告人现在核酸检测是阴性，然而肺部仍有症状，还需继续检测和治疗，不适合羁押。
At the same time, the accused is now negative for nucleic acid testing, yet the lungs still have symptoms that require continued testing and treatment and are not suitable for detention.
被告人辩护律师说，“为了公共安全的需要，对被告人适用缓刑是合适的，因此建议对被告人李某从轻处罚并适用缓刑。
Defendant's defense counsel said: "It is appropriate to apply probation to the accused in the interest of public security, so we suggest that the defendant Li be given a lighter punishment and suspended sentence.
”最终，金山法院合议庭在核实本案的事实、证据并听取各方意见后表示，经审理查明，被告人李某行为已构成妨害传染病防治罪，判处其有期徒刑一年三个月，缓刑一年六个月。
