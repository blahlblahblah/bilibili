澎湃新闻记者 张唯据华尔街日报3月12日报道，美国国立卫生研究院（NIH）过敏和传染病研究所(NIAID)主任安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）当日在一次听证会上表示，在新型冠状病毒爆发期间，美国的疾病检测系统失败，因为人们通常需要医生的许可才能进行检测。
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told a hearing the same day that during the new coronavirus outbreak, the United States' disease-testing system failed because people usually needed doctors' permission to do so.
“这个系统并没有真正适应我们现在的需要。
"The system is not really what we need right now.
”“这是一个失败。
"" It was a failure.
我们承认吧。
Let us admit it.
”安东尼·福西3月12日在听证会上表示美国的疾病检测系统失败。
Anthony Fauci told a hearing on March 12 that the nation's disease-testing system had failed.
安东尼·福西表示，随着新型冠状病毒向全国传播，美国“没有真正准备好”执行所需的新冠病毒检测量。
Anthony Fauci said the United States was "not really ready" to carry out the new coronavirus test as the new coronavirus spread across the country.
他认为，美国不能像其他国家那样迅速、轻松或以同样的数量处理新冠病毒检测，即使病毒已经扩散到44个州，这是“失败的”。
He said the United States could not treat the new crown virus test as quickly, easily or in the same amount as other countries, even if the virus had spread to 44 states, which was a "failure."
福西称，美国在病毒检测方面面临着特别的困难。
The United States faces particular difficulties in testing for the virus, Fossi said.
“任何人都能轻松进行（检测）的想法，其他国家和地区的人正在做的事情，我们没有为此做好准备。
"Anyone can easily think [of testing] what people in other countries and regions are doing, and we are not prepared for that."
我认为应该这样做，但我们没有。
I think that should have been done, but we did not.
”美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC，简称“美国疾控中心”）报告的数据显示，到目前为止，CDC对超过11000个样本进行了新冠病毒检测。
CDC has so far tested more than 11,000 samples for the new crown virus, according to data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
由于患者通常会提供至少两个样本进行测试，因此实际检测的人数可能会少得多。
Since patients usually provide at least two samples for testing, the actual number of people tested is likely to be much lower.
美国疾控中心主任罗伯特·雷德菲尔德称，目前CDC有能力每天处理300到350次检测。
CDC has the ability to process 300 to 350 tests a day, according to CDC Director Robert Redfield.
这个数据远远少于其他国家。
This figure is much lower than in other countries.
据BBC报道，韩国已经测试了21万多人且每天测试近20000名患者，英国测试了29700多人，每天进行1000多次测试。
South Korea has tested more than 210,000 people and tested nearly 20,000 patients a day, while the UK has tested more than 29,700 people and conducted more than 1,000 tests a day, BBC reported.
在加拿大，目前大约有100例确诊病例，其中约有一半在安大略省，而该省已经测试了大约4185个样本。
In Canada, there are currently approximately 100 confirmed cases, about half of which are in Ontario, and approximately 4,185 samples have been tested in the province.
目前，美国的新冠肺炎确诊人数超1300人，造成至少38人死亡。
More than 1,300 people have been diagnosed with pneumonia in the United States, killing at least 38 people.
确诊病例蔓延至全美44个州，包括华盛顿特区。
Confirmed cases spread to 44 states across the United States, including Washington, D.C.
据美国财经媒体CNBN报道，福西当日表示，CDC目前正试图在6个城市进行更广泛的病毒测试。
The company said the same day it was trying to conduct more extensive virus testing in six cities, according to US financial press CNBN.
他们将对所有出现冠状病毒流感症状的患者进行检测，以估计美国人口中有多少人感染了冠状病毒，而不是等待人们要求检测。
They will test all those who show signs of coronavirus flu to estimate how many people in the US population are infected with coronavirus, rather than waiting for people to ask for a test.
CDC主任罗伯特·雷德菲尔德在3月11日的众议院预算听证会上说，资金短缺阻碍了联邦政府对疫情的反应。
CDC Director Robert Redfield told a House budget hearing on March 11 that funding shortages were hampering the federal government's response to the epidemic.
CDC的病毒检测在初期由于质量问题而受到影响，这导致部分认为自己感染新冠病毒的美国人推迟了检测，同时促使纽约等一些州寻求紧急批准以使用自己的试剂盒。
CDC virus detection was initially affected by quality problems, which led some Americans who believed they were infected with the new crown virus to delay testing and prompted some states, such as New York, to seek urgent approval to use their own kits.
