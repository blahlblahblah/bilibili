一份落款为武汉市客运出租汽车管理处的红头文件在网络上传播。

如今武汉市每日新冠确诊患者数量已回落到每日十数例，武汉出租车要恢复运营了吗？3月10日，《财经》记者致电武汉市交通运输局，了解到这份文件属实，出租车恢复正常运营后，市民乘车需要实名登记，但“具体方案还没有定，只是个别人自己把文件发到网上，没经过最后审核。
Today, the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan has dropped to more than a dozen a day, and Wuhan Taxi Service has been called by Caijing to find out that the document is true. After the taxi resumed normal operation, the public need to register by real name.
”至于出租车何时恢复正常运营，武汉市交通运输局相关人士告诉《财经》记者，目前还不清楚时间，全市防疫一盘棋，需要配套复工复产的时间来决定。
As for when taxis will resume normal operation, relevant figures from Wuhan Transport Bureau told Caijing that it was not clear when the city would resume full-scale epidemic prevention.
该人士提醒，对出租车公司以及司机来说，这份文件是提前布置工作、提出要求；对于市民来说，就是得到了实名乘车的信号。
For taxi companies as well as drivers, the document was a reminder that the document was pre-arranged and required; for the public, it was a real-name bus signal, the person warned.
同时，武汉市客运出租汽车管理处相关人士也对《财经》记者表示，除武汉外，全国许多其他城市都在做出租车乘车实名登记，要求实名登记并不代表恢复公共交通。
Besides Wuhan, many other cities around the country are using real-name registration for taxis. Requiring real-name registration does not mean restoring public transport, said Caijing.
《财经》记者从多家网络巡游出租车处得到回应称，尚未得知启动运营的消息。
Caijing reporters from a number of network patrol taxis received a response that the start of the operation has not been known.
