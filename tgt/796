_上游催款、下游催货、手中资金吃紧，随着4000万贷款及后续信贷资金快速落袋，这家奋战在疫情一线的药企老板终于不再为医疗物资储备费用发愁了_文|《财经》记者 张颖馨编辑|袁满“打仗是最好的团建，经历困难也是。
With $40 million in loans and follow-up credit in short supply, the struggling drug owner is finally no longer worried about the cost of storing medical supplies. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
一起吃过香，一起啃过糠，一起扛过抢，一起打过胜仗才是真正的命运共同体。
Have eaten incense together, together gnaws the bran, has carried the gun together, has fought together to win the battle is the true destiny community.
军心在，精神在！“这是一名餐饮企业董事长近日在微信朋友圈的发文。
"The heart of the army, spirit in!" This is a restaurant business chairman recently in micro-letter circle of friends.
新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎（下称“新冠肺炎”）疫情蔓延下，多个行业遭受冲击，身处其中的企业更是不可避免。
New coronavirus infection pneumonia (hereafter referred to as "New Coronavirus") the spread of pneumonia, a number of industries have been hit, in which the enterprises are inevitable.
但《财经》记者注意到，尽管面临诸多挑战，中国的民营企业家依然在通过自己的方式积极“抗疫”。
But despite the challenges, China's private entrepreneurs are actively fighting the disease in their own way, Caijing noted.
本文的主人公是身处抗战一线的湖北某医药企业负责人，自新冠肺炎疫情发生后，他及自己的团队已向前线紧急调度医疗物资过亿元。
The protagonist of this article is the head of a pharmaceutical company in Hubei province on the front line of the war.
此前，他亲自去美国采购了一批体温检测设备等物资，并通过各种途径送回湖北。
Previously, he personally went to the United States to purchase a batch of temperature testing equipment and other supplies, and sent back to Hubei through various channels.
这个春节，对他来说是特别的：安静、冷漠，也备感温情。
The Spring Festival, for him, is special: quiet, cold, but also warm feeling.
他对部分人把武汉的老百姓当作“瘟神”而忿忿不平，他为被感染新冠肺炎的员工而痛心，他也遇到了物资运送、资金流吃紧等难题，因此对“雪中送炭”的人倍感珍惜……“一步都不能退。
He deplored the fact that some people treated Wuhan as a "plague," lamented employees infected with the new crown pneumonia, and faced problems with transportation and funding shortages.
”电话那头的他，声音中夹杂着哽咽。
At the other end of the line there was a lump in his voice.
他说，之所以向《财经》记者讲述这些内容，是希望更多的人关注到民营企业的真正难题和需要，更希望金融机构能把国家政策落到实处，给民营企业足够的成长空间。
'I want more people to pay attention to the real problems and needs of private enterprises, 'he said.' I want financial institutions to put national policies into practice and give private enterprises enough room to grow.
以下为这名湖北医药企业主的自述，《财经》记者进行了部分删减。
Here's the self-report of the Hubei medical entrepreneur, a partial cut by Caijing.
三次被拒贷不改初心从疫情爆发到现在，我平均每天就休息两个小时。
From the outbreak of the disease until now, I have had an average of two hours off a day.
不仅仅是我，我们公司的很多员工也是如此，尤其是调度员、司机，彻夜未眠运送物资。
Not only I, but also many of our employees, especially dispatchers, drivers, sleepless nights.
我们的工作主要是向医院、疾控中心等，提供包括防护服、口罩、消毒水、护目镜、体温枪等在内的医疗物资。
Our work is mainly to provide hospitals, CDC, etc., including protective clothing, masks, disinfectant, goggles, body temperature guns and other medical supplies.
目前我们已经调度并向相关方供应了超过1亿元的医疗物资。
So far, we have dispatched and supplied more than 100 million yuan of medical supplies to the parties concerned.
虽然这些是我们日常工作的一部分，但在疫情下，日常工作却变得就像“大山”压在我们身上。
While these are part of our daily routine, routine work becomes like a mountain to us in the face of an epidemic.
以往熟悉得不能再熟悉、顺利得不再顺利的环节，现在可能都成了我们抗疫工作中的“拦路虎”。
Once familiar with no longer familiar, smooth no longer smooth links, may now become our anti-epidemic work in the "Land Rover."
比如说物资的供应、调配、运输等工作。
For example, the supply of materials, deployment, transportation and other work.
春节期间，所有工厂全部放假，这是中国的传统，即便你给员工加几倍的钱，也不见得就能立即开工。
It is a Chinese tradition that all factories will be closed during the Spring Festival. Even if you add several times as much money to your employees, you won't be able to start right away.
再者，为了防止疫情蔓延，很多地方采取了封路等措施，员工无法及时到岗，不少工厂难以恢复生产。
Moreover, in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, many places have adopted road closures and other measures, staff can not be on duty in time, many factories can not resume production.
当前，包括医疗等物资的储备、供应、运输等，都存在一定难题。
At present, there are some difficulties in the storage, supply and transportation of medical and other materials.
我这次来美国购买医疗物资，返回时就只能先乘坐飞机至中国周边国家，再通过绿色通道送至湖北。
I came to the United States to buy medical supplies, on my return only to fly to China's neighboring countries, and then through the Green Channel to Hubei.
而比物资更让我头疼的，是如何补足资金缺口。
And more than the material worries me, is how to make up for the funding gap.
举个例子，平常我们可能每个月就供应1亿元左右的物资，但在疫情出现后，每个月可能就需要供应3亿元左右的物资。
For example, we may supply about 100 million yuan of supplies every month, but we may need to supply about 300 million yuan per month after the outbreak.
之前拿1亿元的物资，前期我只需支付3000万元，后续7000万元慢慢付。
Before taking 100 million yuan of materials, I just need to pay 30 million yuan, 70 million yuan to pay slowly.
但现在，要拿到1亿元物资，我就得把1亿元现款先交出去，而且还只能拿回5000万元的物资，因为大家都在排队等货。
But now, to get 100 million yuan, I have to hand over 100 million yuan in cash, and only get 50 million yuan worth of goods back, because everyone is waiting in line.
货紧、上下游供应商存在一定程度的涨价、打款后排队等货、下游（医院、疾控中心等）无法及时付款……这些情况都指向同一个问题：资金。
Shortage of goods, higher prices for upstream and downstream suppliers, queuing for delivery, delays in payment downstream (hospitals, CDC, etc.)... all point to the same problem: funding.
通常情况下，我们公司账面上会有5000万-6000万元的现金，目前已储备并供应了超过1.2亿元的医疗物资。
Normally, our company has between 50 million and 60 million yuan in cash on its books, and it has already stockpiled and supplied more than 120 million yuan in medical supplies.
但若按照未来两个月的储备供应计划，还需要3.5亿-4亿元左右的资金。
But a further $350 million to $400 million would be needed if the next two months of supply of reserves are to be met.
除了医院和疾控中心，我们的物资会供应到药房等地，这样基本能保证一半的资金回流，但依然还存在1.8亿-2亿元的资金缺口。
In addition to hospitals and CDC, our supplies will be supplied to pharmacies and so on, basically ensuring half of the funds flow back, but there is still a funding gap of 180-200 million yuan.
怎么办？如果资金缺口补不上，就无法采购到足够多的货。
If the funding gap is not filled, we will not be able to purchase enough.
更准确地说，是“抢”不到更多的货。
More precisely, it is not possible to "grab" more goods.
重压之下，只能向平常与我们有业务往来的金融机构寻求资金支持。
Under heavy pressure, we can only seek financial support from financial institutions that do business with us on a regular basis.
彼时，我们立即向一家湖北省外的城市商业银行提交了贷款申请，对方最初回复他们还没有上班；上班后我们再次提交申请，对方说额度受限；于是我们重新进行申请调整，对方则建议“还是找本地银行更好”。
At that time, we immediately submitted a loan application to a city commercial bank outside Hubei Province. The other party initially replied that they had not yet gone to work.
我从银行内部人士打听到，对方一方面是担心我们后续无法及时还款，另一方面是觉得异地放款所需要的程序和手续麻烦，不便进行。
I learned from bank insiders that the other side was worried that we would not be able to repay on time, and that the procedures and procedures required for a different loan were cumbersome and inconvenient.
从风险角度来说，这样的考虑我可以理解。
From a risk point of view, I understand that.
但是三次拒绝，消耗了不少沟通时间，最关键的是资金还没能及时到位。
But three refusals, consumed a lot of communication time, the most critical is that the funds have not arrived in time.
另外，从我们2019年的经营情况来看（营收近33亿元，净利润超2亿元），还款不存在太大问题。
In addition, judging from our business situation in 2019 (with close to 3.3 billion yuan in revenue and a net profit of over 200 million yuan), there is no major problem with repayment.
上游催款、下游催货、手中资金吃紧，再加上银行的拒贷，心理真的是五味杂陈。
Upstream demand, downstream urges, tight funds in hand, combined with the bank's refusal to lend, psychology is really mixed.
不身处这个位置，你永远无法体会这是怎样的一种压力和滋味。
Without this position, you will never know what kind of pressure and taste it is.
30小时内获4000万元贷款正是因为吃过“闭门羹”，才能更深刻地体会到“雪中送炭”的珍贵。
30 hours of loans of 40 million yuan is precisely because of the "closed door", can more deeply experience the "snow in the delivery of carbon" precious.
就在之前提到的那家银行第一次拒绝贷款时，我就意识到了处于非常时期，即便是平常银行眼中的“优质客户”，可能也不一定能顺利得到资金支持。
When the bank in question refused to lend for the first time, I realized that even a "good customer" in the usual bank's eyes might not always be well funded.
于是我亲自与一家政策性银行支行行长联系，说明了当前由于医疗物资采购调度，需要大量资金支持。
So I personally contact the president of a policy bank branch, explained that the current procurement of medical supplies due to the scheduling, need substantial financial support.
这名支行行长立即将我们的情况反馈给地方分行行长，后者又反馈至省分行行长，再反馈至总行一位副行长处。
The president of the branch immediately reported our case back to the local branch governor, who in turn reported it back to a vice-president of the head office.
随后，该银行启动了绿色通道和相应的应急方案，总行授权省分行，由省分行相关负责人立即启动相关程序。
Subsequently, the bank launched the Green Channel and corresponding emergency plan, the head office authorized provincial branches, and the relevant provincial branch officials immediately initiated the relevant procedures.
当天，这家银行相关负责人紧急召开贷审会，展开对我们的项目调查、信贷审核、合规审查等工作，直到凌晨，大家还在通过微信视频或电话等方式推进。
On the same day, the relevant officials of the bank urgently convened a loan committee to start the investigation of our project, credit audit, compliance review, and other work, until the early hours of the morning, people are also through micro-mail video or telephone.
过程中，因为封城导致一些材料无法及时送达，我们便只能将扫描件提交给银行。
During the process, we had to submit the scanned copies to the bank because some materials could not be delivered in time because of the blockade.
对方也考虑到我们的情况，对于一些无法立即提交的文件，同意我们后续补齐。
The other side also took our situation into account, for some documents that could not be submitted immediately, agreed to our follow-up.
最终，该银行支行将4000万元发放到我们的账户中，从申请贷款到资金入账，整个过程所花费的时间不超过30小时。
Eventually, the branch issued $40 million into our account, and the whole process took no more than 30 hours from the time the loan was requested to the account.
与平常向银行申请贷款相比，任何一个程序都没有少，但之前不用十天半个月，是无法完成的。
There is no less procedure than applying to a bank for a loan, but it cannot be completed before it has taken ten days or half a month.
后来我听这家银行内部的人说，这应该是该银行史上在应急事件中支持企业最快的一笔贷款。
Later I heard from people inside the bank that it should be the fastest loan in the bank's history to support a business in an emergency.
资金一到账，我就赶紧排队“抢货”，不夸张地说，我当时都掉了眼泪。
As soon as the money arrived, I quickly queued up to "grab the goods." I wept, to put it bluntly.
能这么快拿到这笔4000万元的信用担保贷款，除了之前这家银行对我们经营情况有一定了解外（有业务往来），确实是对方考虑到当下，越快越多的资金到位，我们才能去调度采购更多的医疗物资，救更多人的性命。
The fact that the bank has some knowledge of our business is that the faster the funds become available, the more medical supplies we can arrange to purchase more medical supplies and save more lives.
疫情发生后，紧急调度采购医疗物资。
After the outbreak of the emergency dispatch procurement of medical supplies.
受访者供图我很感谢这家政策性银行，在我压力最大的时候“雪中送炭”。
Interviewees: I am grateful to this policy bank for "delivering in the snow" at my most stressful times.
近日，我们又向这家银行申请了一笔2000万元的贷款，也迅速得到了响应。
Recently, we applied to the bank for a loan of 20 million yuan, and we got a quick response.
银行对企业的支持应该是一种使命和担当，不应只考虑到自己的业绩和利益。
Bank support for enterprises should be a mission and responsibility, not just take into account their own performance and interests.
任何一家大企业都是从小企业发展而来。
Any big business has grown out of a small business.
金融系统的不少政策都是很好的，但依然有很多小企业贷不到钱，最终因资金断裂而倒下。
Many of the financial system's policies were good, but there were still many small businesses that could not afford to lend and eventually collapsed because of the collapse of capital.
这其中肯定有不少是经营不善引起，但是对于那些有发展潜力的企业，银行应该多一分支持和帮助。
A lot of this must be due to bad management, but banks should be more supportive and helpful to those with growth potential.
在经济下行的环境中，银行的钱不能躺着“睡觉”。
In an economic downturn, banks cannot "sleep" on their money.
值得庆幸的是，疫情之下，国家监管部门也在通过出台相关政策加大对疫情防控相关重点企业，甚至是对受疫情影响的其他行业里中小企业的扶持。
Fortunately, the epidemic situation, the national regulatory authorities through the introduction of relevant policies to increase the prevention and control of key enterprises, even in other industries affected by the epidemic support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
截至目前，我们已经得到了来自中国农业发展银行、武汉农商行、交通银行和光大银行的贷款支持。
So far, we have received loan support from Agricultural Development Bank of China, Wuhan Agricultural Bank, Bank of Communications and Everbright Bank.
至少最近两个月的医疗物资储备所需费用，我们是充足的。
At least for the last two months, we have been able to cover the cost of medical supplies.
经历过这些，再来看金融机构对企业的支持，我只有一个建议，就是“落到实处”。
After all this, and looking at the financial institutions to support the enterprise, I have only one suggestion, is to "get down to earth."
落实，就是不要来虚的落实，不说虚话，也不说套话，你落实就行，真正的去帮助企业。
Implementation, is not to empty implementation, do not say empty words, do not say cliche, you just implement, really to help enterprises.
比如新增贷款、延期、降息、不抽贷断贷等等，只要能落到实处，很多好的企业都死不了。
For example, new loans, extensions, interest rates, non-loan loans and so on, as long as the implementation of many good enterprises can not die.
再好的政策，一旦不落到实处，即便是经营没问题的企业，都可能会死掉。
No matter how good the policy, once the implementation, even if the business is not a problem, may die.
一句话，政府拿出政策，银行则得拿出实实在在到位的力度。
In short, the government comes up with policies, and banks have to come up with concrete measures.
“舍小家为大家”物质上的压力有所缓解，但是精神上的压力也着实不小。
The "small house for everyone" material pressure has eased, but the mental pressure is not small.
中国今年的春节极其不平凡，它是安静的，但同时也是冷漠的。
Chinese Spring Festival this year is very unusual, it is quiet, but also indifferent.
说“安静”，春节本是走亲访友的时候，如今大家却因为疫情被“隔离”在家。
Say "quiet", Spring Festival is a visit to friends and relatives, but now because of the outbreak of "isolation" at home.
安静之中，它又是冷漠的。
Quiet, it is cold.
在国外，其他国家的人会用异样的眼神或措施对待中国人，比如他们看到中国人，便会赶紧捂住鼻子；我去美国入关时，就被一遍又一遍地审查。
Abroad, people in other countries treat the Chinese with strange eyes or measures. When they see a Chinese, for example, they always cover their noses.
而在国内，不少人则把从湖北来的人当作“瘟神”，唯恐避之不及；我们的调度员在连夜进行跨省调度时，忍受着饥饿和冷眼……理性地思考，湖北的老百姓也是“受害者”，他们没有错，不应该遭受“特殊”对待。
But at home, many people from Hubei people as "Misery", for fear of escape; our dispatchers in the night when cross-provincial dispatch, endure hunger and cold eyes... rational thinking, Hubei people are also "victims", they should not be "special" treatment.
还有人说，现在所有行业都不行，唯医药行业独好。
Still others say that all industries are failing these days, and that the pharmaceutical industry is in a unique position.
说句心里话，无论是有疫情，还是没有疫情，医药行业都不会差。
To tell you the truth, whether there is an epidemic or not, the pharmaceutical industry will not be bad.
但如果在疫情出现的时候，我们一门心思去赚钱，赚黑心钱，肯定可以实现暴利。
But if we focus on making money and making money in the event of an epidemic, we can make a lot of money.
但我们能这样做吗？答案是否定的。
But can we do that? The answer is no.
即便国家没有相关规定，我们的良心也过不去。
Even in the absence of State regulation, our consciences do not prevail.
更何况，相比起赚钱、“独好”来说，我们谁不希望将自己与病毒隔离，不去一线冒险，与家人团聚。
What's more, none of us want to isolate ourselves from the virus, risk taking the first steps and reunite with their families, as opposed to making money and being "alone."
但从春节前一天开始，我们公司的全部采购人员就没有放假，一直到今天，每天连续18小时作战。
But from the day before the Spring Festival, our company's entire procurement staff did not have a holiday, until today, 18 hours a day in a row.
整个团队40余人，坚持“抗疫”。
The entire team of more than 40 people, adhere to "anti-epidemic."
工作人员连夜未休，向一线运送医疗物资。
Staff stayed overnight to deliver medical supplies to the front line.
受访者供图他们冒着最易被感染的危险，他们极度劳累，他们家里有小孩住院，老人在病中，小区被封闭。
Respondents put them at greatest risk of infection. They were extremely tired, their children were hospitalized, the elderly were ill and the community was closed.
他们不谈任何条件，保证随叫随到，接受任务、执行命令，“舍小家为大家”。
They do not talk about any conditions, guarantee on-call, accept the task, carry out the command, "small house for everyone."
即便做好了相关防护，依然有两名调度员被感染：其中一个病情危重，在医院治疗；另外一个在家中自我隔离，服药治疗。
Even with the protection in place, two dispatchers were infected: one was in critical condition and was treated in hospital; the other was isolated at home and was on medication.
我心里特别不好受，本可以让全部员工停止工作，回家“隔离”病毒，但我不能。
I was particularly upset that I could have had all my employees stop working and go home to "isolate" the virus, but I couldn't.
我们不是什么伟大的人，在自己的国家、家乡遇到困难的时候，即便我们做的事是沧海一粟，但也要负重前行，不能往后退一步。
We are not great people, in their own country, home when the difficulties, even if we do a drop in the ocean, but also have to bear the burden of moving forward, can not step back.
再寒冷的冬天总会过去，再迟到的春天终将到来。
No matter how cold the winter is, the late spring will come.
既然遭遇磨难，除了勇敢面对，我们别无选择。
Since suffering, we have no choice but to face it bravely.
但只要全国人民上下齐心，疫情结束指日可待。
But the end of the epidemic is within reach as long as the nation works together.
届时，武汉还是那个武汉，但中国人却连接得更加紧密。
At that time, Wuhan is still that Wuhan, but the Chinese people are more closely connected.
