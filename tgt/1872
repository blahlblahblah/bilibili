“武汉的疫情现在应该是控制住了，转机随时可能出现”文/夏春平，中国新闻社副社长、副总编辑因新冠肺炎疫情而“封城”中的武汉从来没有像今天这样受世人关注，著名作家方方每天一篇的“武汉日记”也因此走红网络。
Wuhan, the vice-president and deputy editor of the China News Agency, has never received as much attention as it does today, and the famous writer Fang Fang's "Wuhan Diary," a daily article written by Fang Fang, has also gained popularity.
其平实的语言、生动的叙事、真切的情感、敢言直言的风格感染着每一位读者，被网民争睹为快。
Its plain language, vivid narrative, real emotion, dare to speak the style of direct words infect every reader, by the netizen for quick.
“武汉日记”的作者、著名作家方方2月22日在武汉接受中新社记者独家采访。
Wuhan Diary, the author of the famous writer Fang Fang, gave an exclusive interview to the China News Agency in Wuhan on February 22.
中新社记者全安华摄喝长江水长大，十分熟悉武汉世间百态和风土人情的方方今日在武汉接受中新社记者独家专访时说：“我只是想记录一下，你也看到，很多琐碎事。
"I just want to record that, as you can see, there are many trivial matters," Fang Fang, a journalist with Xinhua News Agency, told China Daily in an exclusive interview in Wuhan today.
而且最初也没打算天天记。
And I didn't mean to remember it every day.
完全没有想到会有这么多人愿意读。
Little did I expect so many people to read it.
我一直觉得很奇怪。
I always thought it was weird.
”中断小说创作，改写“武汉日记”谈起写作“武汉日记”的初衷，方方告诉记者，受新冠肺炎疫情影响，当下许多武汉人在受难，在与死神较量。
"Wuhan Diary" about the original intention of writing "Wuhan Diary," Fang Fang told reporters that due to the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, many Wuhan people are suffering and fighting death.
没有从小到老都生活在武汉的人，恐怕很难有这样的心情，也很难理解这份伤痛，而自己却根本无力相帮，所以她的内心也有创伤。
It is difficult for a person who has not lived in Wuhan from childhood to old to have such a feeling, it is difficult to understand the pain, but he is powerless to help, so her heart is also traumatized.
“很多人留言，说每天看了我的武汉日记他们才安心。
"Many people leave a message saying that they are relieved to read my Wuhan diary every day.
这真是让我在惊讶之中，也深感荣幸。
It was a surprise and a privilege.
果真这样，我愿意为他们天天写。
If so, I would like to write for them every day.
”方方说。
"said Fang.
从正月初一开始，方方通过“武汉日记”记录自己的所见所知，每天在网上发布。
From the first day of the first month, Fang Fang through the "Wuhan Diary" record their own what they know, published daily on the Internet.
“对于因疫情隔离在家里的人，文学在此时显得很无力。
"Literature is powerless at this time for those who are isolated from their homes by the epidemic.
但记录下真实的场景和自己的想法，却是很重要的。
But it is important to document the real situation and your own thoughts.
”方方告诉记者：“其实，有几天看的人太多让我有恐惧感，它在网络上传播得太快了，使得我这种习惯小众阅读的人很不适应。
"In fact, I was afraid of seeing too many people for a few days," Fang told reporters. "It spread so fast on the Internet that people like me, who read in small groups, were not used to it.
我几乎就不想写了，但我同学和朋友他们仍然鼓励我继续写，一直写到‘封城’解封那天为止。
I hardly ever wanted to write, but my classmates and friends encouraged me to continue writing until the day the 'Seal' was unsealed.
”“武汉日记”的作者、著名作家方方（左）2月22日在武汉接受中新社记者独家采访。

中新社记者全安华摄　方方坦言，她根本没想过“武汉日记”如此受到读者追捧。
Xinhua News Agency reporter Quan An Hua Fang admitted that she never thought "Wuhan Diary" was so popular with readers.
“‘武汉日记’里面就是些零碎事，加上一点自己的感想，也没有像写散文那样去考究用词用句。
"Wuhan Diary" is some fragmentary things, plus a little bit of their own feelings, also did not like to write prose to study the use of terms.
而微博本来就是个闲扯的地方，想到哪写到哪，随意自由，还经常不小心有错漏字。
And microblogging is a place to gossip, think where to write, free at will, and often careless mistakes and omissions.
我也很奇怪，不知道为什么大家这样喜欢。
I am also very strange, do not know why people like so much.
我本来是准备在春节期间完成一部中篇小说的，现在也完成不了。
I was going to finish a novel during the Spring Festival, but I can't finish it now.
我的心和全国众多网民一样都集中在疫情上，定不下心来写小说，而写‘武汉日记’可以让我的心安定下来。
My heart and the nation's many netizens are focused on the epidemic, can not resolve to write novels, and 'Wuhan Diary' can let my heart settle down.
”疫情转机随时可能出现对于疫情的走势，方方认为：“武汉的疫情现在应该是控制住了，转机随时可能出现。
"The situation is likely to turn the tide of the epidemic at any time, Fang Fang said:" Wuhan epidemic should now be under control, turning the corner at any time.
疫情的发展经历过几个阶段。
The epidemic has gone through several stages.
一是经历过六神无主的恐慌阶段，这一阶段应该到初一那天结束。
One is to go through a panic phase, which should end on the first day of junior high school.
全国开始关注，高层发有指示，各地也派援手。
National attention, high-level instructions, local help.
老百姓心里知道，一旦成为国家行动，以中国的方式，肯定能控制住。
The common people know that once it becomes a national action, the Chinese way will certainly be able to control.
所以武汉市民就不再恐慌了。
So Wuhan city people no longer panic.
但意想不到的是，此后大量的病人开始发作，武汉人进入了极其痛苦的阶段。
But unexpectedly, since then, a large number of patients began to attack, Wuhan people have entered a very painful phase.
发病的人越来越多，医院在猝不及防中根本无力救助到这么多人，而且医护人员也大量感染。
The number of cases is increasing, hospitals are overwhelmed by the inability to reach such a large number of people, and medical personnel are also heavily infected.
那些天病人到处奔走，呼救无用就医无门，医护人员也快崩溃，这也是最压抑最无助最难过的阶段。
Those days, patients everywhere, call for help no access to health care, medical staff is about to collapse, this is also the most oppressive, the most helpless and sad phase.
应该说，省市换将，以及方舱医院建立，十九个省份驰援湖北，这个局面才慢慢缓解下来。
It should be said that the provincial and municipal changes of generals, and the establishment of the square cabin hospital, 19 provinces to help Hubei, the situation slowly eased.
现在已经见不到呼救无门的情况了，现在重症病人，几乎都是以前的存量。
There was no way to call for help, and now patients with severe illnesses are almost always in stock.
因为没有得到医治，拖延成重症。
Failure to receive medical treatment delayed serious illness.
重症病人数量很大，因此死亡率还没有降下来。
The number of seriously ill patients is so high that the mortality rate has not yet fallen.
”图为武汉客厅“方舱医院”里的医护人员。
The picture shows the medical staff in the Wuhan living room's "Fang Cao Hospital."
中新社发 高翔 摄方方露出久违的笑容说：“有了全国各地的支持，武汉的疫情正在朝拐点迈进。
"With support from all over the country, the epidemic in Wuhan is moving towards an inflection point," said Fang Fang, a senior Chinese news agency.
许多患者经过治疗已经出院，痊愈者的脸上都露着笑容，这不是装出来的笑容，而是发自内心的笑容，尽管这些笑容不久前满街都是，今天看着有久违感。
Many patients have been discharged from the hospital after treatment, and the faces of those who have recovered are beaming, not with a fake smile, but with a smile of the heart, despite the fact that not so long ago all over the street, it seems to be a long time ago.
但有了这样的开始，后面的满街笑容不也会很快到来吗？”“武汉人民真是太好了！”“武汉人民真是太好了，为让国人生活如常，他们扛下灾难。
But with such a beginning, the smile on the back of the street will not come soon.Wuhan people are so kind, they carry the disaster in order to make people live as usual.
总体上武汉市民都是相当配合的，他们被关在家里几乎一个月，这是件非常不容易的事。
Generally speaking, Wuhan city people are quite cooperative, they are locked up at home for almost a month, which is a very difficult thing.
”方方动情地说：“成年人，理智一点还算好，那些家庭有孩子的，或是有其他非新冠肺炎疾病的，那些必须时时用药的慢性病人，如白血病患者需透析的，还有那些被堵在城外的五百万回不了城的人的日子都很艰难，他们都在为疫情付出代价。
"Adults," Fang said feelingly, "those families with children or other non-Newly Crowded Pneumonia, chronic patients who have to take constant medication, such as leukaemia, and the five million people who are stuck outside the city and cannot return to the city, are paying the price for the epidemic.
”2月9日，武汉汉口将军路一家快递公司的快递点，快递员们整理到站的快件。
On Feb. 9, couriers packed express mail to a express delivery company on Wuhan Hankou General Road.
新冠肺炎疫情之下，大批民众选择线上购物，快递员比往常更忙碌。
With the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, people are choosing to shop online and couriers are busier than usual.
中新社记者 张畅 摄“武汉‘封城’近一个月了，千万人口的城市却一如既往地井然有序。
Zhang Chang, a reporter for the China News Agency, said: "Wuhan has been closed for nearly a month, but tens of millions of people in the city as always orderly.
在我眼前出现最多的有四种人，一是送外卖的小哥，他们仍然骑着小车奔波在路上；二是警察，寒冷的天气中他们大多站在各个路口和医院门口，往往直面各种人等，执行必须执行的任务；三是基层社区工作人员，辛苦地挨家挨户地上门查访；四是环卫工人，尽管行人少，路面没那么脏，只有一些树叶，但他们恪尽职守，认真打扫。
Four people appeared before my eyes: the delivery boy, who still rode the car on the road; the police, who stood mostly at junctions and hospital gates in cold weather, often facing people directly; the grass-roots community workers, who worked hard from door to door; and the sanitation workers, though few pedestrians and not so dirty, but with some leaves.
从疫情开始到现在，他们一直以从容的姿态留在我们眼里，默默无闻地镇定着我们整个城市的心。
From the beginning of the epidemic to the present, they have remained calm in our eyes, quietly calming the hearts of our whole city.
”方方说。
"said Fang.
“连我都想找心理咨询师”方方对记者说：“对武汉这样千万人口的城市实行‘封城’，史上未有，而老百姓也从未这样被关在家几十天的经历。
"I even wanted to see a counselor," Fang told reporters. "There has never been a time in history when Wuhan was a city with a population of 10 million people, and people have never been so confined to their homes for dozens of days.
这些生活在武汉的人几乎人人心里都有创伤，这恐怕是绕不过去的一件事。
These people living in Wuhan almost everyone has a wound in their hearts, I am afraid it is impossible to avoid the past.
就像我在2月12日的‘武汉日记’中写道：‘无论是关在家里一个尚且健康的人群，或是曾经顶着冷雨满街奔波过的病人，更或目送亲人装入运尸袋被车拖走的医护人员……’譬如疫情过后大家出门，敢不敢摘口罩？与人谈话，敢不敢近距离？可能都会有心理障碍。
As I wrote in the Wuhan Diary on Feb. 12, 'Whether it's a healthy person at home, or a patient who has run through the cold rain, or a loved one in a body bag pulled away by a car...' For example, if you go out after the epidemic, dare not take off your mask?
而病人家属和亡者家属的创痛应该更深，当有一天武汉‘解封’会数家欢喜数家悲伤，没有得病的市民大都会很高兴，毕竟自由了，但那些病亡家属，必然格外悲伤，灯火万家，独少一人。
When Wuhan 'unsealed' will one day be happy to count the families of the sad, not sick citizens will be happy, after all, free, but those of the sick and dead families, will be exceptionally sad, lights, alone.
这种家破人亡的痛感只有自己知道。
The pain of a broken home is only self-evident.
”　　2月8日，正值元宵节，中国多地亮起灯光，为武汉加油！为中国加油！图为武汉市多处地标建筑亮起了加油标语。
On Feb. 8, during the Lantern Festival, China lit more lights to cheer Wuhan! Come on to China! Picture shows refueling slogans for many landmark buildings in Wuhan City.
中新社记者 安源 摄方方呼吁，疫情过后，政府应该组织大批心理咨询专家，对武汉人进行心理治疗和人文关怀，这是非常必要的事。
After the outbreak, the government should organize a large number of psychological consultants to provide psychological treatment and humanistic care to the Wuhan people, which is very necessary.
有些人可能会不承认自己有心理阴影，但实际上，这些阴影也许会伴随终身，形成困扰。
Some people may not admit that they have a psychological shadow, but in reality, these shadows can be a lifelong obsession.
严重者，比如曾经四处求医四处碰壁者，会时时有噩梦。
Serious people, such as those who have sought medical treatment everywhere, will have nightmares from time to time.
当然，也得有些专业人士出面引导大家，让自己学会疏导自己。
Of course, some professionals have to come forward to guide us, let themselves learn to channel themselves.
“连我自己都想找一名心理咨询师，疏导心理问题。
"I even wanted to find a counselor myself to deal with psychological problems.
我天天写‘武汉日记’，也算是自己疏导情绪的一种方式吧。
I write 'Wuhan Diary' every day, is also a way to channel their emotions bar.
”方方说。
"said Fang.
“我不是挑刺，而是反思”方方在“武汉日记”中曾偶尔夹有直言和批评。
"I am not a thorn, but reflection" Fang Fang in the "Wuhan Diary" once in a while there were direct remarks and criticism.
对此，方方解释，正如她在2月4日的“武汉日记”中写的：“这么大的灾难扛得住扛不住都得硬扛死扛。
In response, Fang explained, as she wrote in her February 4 "Wuhan Diary," that such a disaster cannot be carried without being carried.
但是就算扛着终也有憋闷不住的时候，我替你扛，你也得让我骂。
But even carrying the end of a suffocating time, I carry for you, you have to let me scold.
”方方坦承，在“武汉日记”中自己也偶有对武汉市对前期疫情处理失误的埋怨和温和批评。
Fang admitted that he occasionally complained and mildly criticized Wuhan for its handling of the previous outbreak in the Wuhan Diary.
“如果连发泄一下痛苦都不准，连几句牢骚和反思都不准，难道真想让大家疯掉？”方方说。
"If even vent the pain is not allowed, even a few words of complaint and reflection are not allowed to let everyone crazy?" Fang Fang said.

“我有时候也会问自己，跟世界上许多的城市相比，武汉并不是一个宜人之地，尤其气候令人讨厌。
"I sometimes ask myself that Wuhan is not a pleasant place to live in compared with many other cities in the world.
那么我到底会喜欢它的什么呢？是它的历史文化？还是它的风土人情？更或是它的湖光山色？其实，这些都不是，我喜欢它的理由只源于我自己的熟悉。
So what do I like about it? Its history and culture? Or its customs? Or its lakes? Actually, none of this is true. The reason I like it is only because I know it well.
因为，把全世界的城市都放到我的面前，我却只熟悉它。
Because, to put all the world's cities in front of me, but I only know it.
就仿佛许多的人向你走来，在无数陌生的面孔中，只有一张脸笑盈盈地对着你，向你露出你熟悉的笑意，这张脸就是武汉。
As if a lot of people came to you, in countless strange faces, only a face smiling at you, you show you the familiar smile, this face is Wuhan.
”方方告诉中新社记者这是她多年前在一篇文章中所写，“诗云：相看两不厌，唯有敬亭山。
"Fang told China News Agency that this was what she wrote in an article many years ago." Poetry clouds: never tire of seeing each other, only Jingting Mountain.
武汉就是我的敬亭山。
Wuhan is my Jingting Mountain.
”　　方方直言：“我写‘武汉日记’的基调始终秉持与政府绝对保持一致，绝对配合政府的每一项举动，并且努力帮助政府说服不理解的人们，帮助政府安抚焦虑的人们。
"The tone of my 'Wuhan Diary' has always been based on absolute consistency with the government, absolute cooperation with the government's every move, and efforts to help convince people who do not understand, and help the government to appease anxious people.
只是我们在方式上各有不同，可能在写作的过程中，偶尔会冒出自己的感想，说几句反思的话，如此而已。
But we differ in the way we write, and may occasionally come up with our own thoughts and reflections, and that's all.
毋庸讳言，这次武汉疫情暴露出政府在治理中的许多问题。
Needless to say, this Wuhan epidemic exposed the government in the governance of many problems.
如果我们反思了，吸取教训，并将结论付诸行动才不至于对不起在这次疫情中死去的百姓。
If we reflect, draw lessons, and put our conclusions into action, we will not be sorry for the people who died in the epidemic.
”　　她说：“我不是一个专门挑刺的人，对治理难处也多有体谅。
"I'm not a particular prick," she said. "I'm also considerate of governance difficulties.
对自己所看到的明亮之处，也在‘武汉日记’中及时给予呈现。
The bright spot that sees to oneself, also in 'Wuhan Diary' gives in time to present.
”　　“疫情过后，武汉人便会回到以前的生活轨迹。
"After the epidemic, Wuhan people will return to their previous life trajectory.
生活就是这个样子，像长江，永远奔腾，不会停歇。
This is life, like the Yangtze River, forever Pentium, will not stop.
”方方说。
