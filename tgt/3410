“在疫情前，武汉的医疗废物产生量是每天40多吨。
"Before the outbreak, Wuhan generated more than 40 tons of medical waste a day.
随着病例的逐渐增加，最高峰，医疗废物的产生量达到240多吨。
With the gradual increase of cases, the peak of the production of medical waste reached more than 240 tons.
”“现在一个医废桶大概三四十公斤，最重时，甚至超过五六十公斤。
'Now a bucket is about thirty or forty kilograms, and at its heaviest, fifty or sixty kilograms.
”湖北襄阳一家环保企业企管部副总监孙瑜告诉《中国新闻周刊》，武汉封城后，公司接到武汉市生态环境局的电话，要求驰援武汉，帮助清运医疗垃圾。
"After Wuhan Fengcheng, the company received a call from Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Ecological Environment to help clear medical waste," Sun Yu, deputy director of an environmental protection enterprise in Xiangyang, Hubei province, told China News Weekly.
随着疫情暴发，医疗废物不仅数量暴增，种类也超出以往。
As the outbreak unfolded, not only did the quantity of medical waste increase, but so did the variety.
孙瑜说，平时常见的医疗废物，包括针管、盐水袋、棉签、口罩、防护服，这些东西装在一个医废桶里不算重。
The usual clinical waste, including syringes, salt water bags, cotton swab, masks and protective clothing, is not too heavy in a medical waste bin, Sun said.
但疫情期间，所有病人接触过的东西，都被视为医疗废物，包括生活垃圾、床褥、甚至病人的呕吐物等。
During the outbreak, however, all patients were treated as medical waste, including household waste, bedding, and even the patient's vomit.
“在疫情前，武汉的医疗废物产生量是（每天）40多吨。
"Before the outbreak, Wuhan produced more than 40 tons of medical waste each day.
随着病例的逐渐增加，最高峰，医疗废物的产生量达到240多吨。
With the gradual increase of cases, the peak of the production of medical waste reached more than 240 tons.
”3月11日，生态环境部应急办主任赵群英在国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上指出，这次疫情暴露出湖北武汉医疗废物处置能力差距比较大的情况。
Zhao Qunying, director of the emergency department of the Ministry of Ecological Environment, told a news conference at the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism that the outbreak had revealed a large gap in the medical waste disposal capacity of Wuhan, Hubei Province.
医废“井喷”2月13日，王春山带领7辆医废运输车，花了5个多小时，从襄阳开往武汉，又在城区辗转6个小时，才到达湖北省人民医院，连夜开始收集武汉的医疗废物。
Medical waste "blowout" February 13, Wang Chunshan led seven medical waste trucks, spent more than five hours from Xiangyang to Wuhan, and toss and turn around the city for six hours before arriving at the Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, where he began collecting medical waste overnight.
王春山是湖北中油优艺环保科技有限公司（简称中油环保）董事长。
Wang Chunshan is chairman of Hubei Zhongyou Eco Environmental Protection Co. Ltd.
应武汉市生态环境局要求，1月29日，中油环保派出首批团队驰援武汉，包括5辆车、12名工作人员。
At the request of Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Ecological Environment, on January 29, the first team sent to Wuhan, including five vehicles, 12 staff.
2月13日，已经是公司派出的第三批支援团队。
February 13, has been the company's third support team.
医疗废物是一种特殊垃圾，可能具有感染性、毒性或者其他危害，需要特殊处置。
Medical waste is a special type of waste that can be infectious, toxic or otherwise hazardous and requires special disposal.
“疫情之前，有时候我们会隔天去一次医废的集中收集点。
"Before the outbreak, sometimes we would go to a collection point every other day.
而在疫情最严重时，有的医院我们一天要去两次，保证医废及时清运。
And in the worst of the epidemic, some hospitals we have to go twice a day, to ensure the timely removal of waste.
”孙瑜介绍，疫情期间的工作量是平时的数倍。
The workload during the outbreak was several times greater than usual, Sun said.
疫情之前，按照规定，医疗废物暂时贮存时间不得超过72小时，如果公司遇到窑炉检修或者其他问题，有3天时间暂存。
Prior to the outbreak, clinical waste was required to be stored temporarily for no more than 72 hours and for three days if the company experienced kiln repairs or other problems.
疫情期间，按照要求，必须在24小时内对所有医废日清日结。
During the outbreak, all medical waste must be closed within 24 hours, as required.
据孙瑜介绍，截至目前，公司往武汉派遣了85名工作人员，35辆车。
So far, the company has sent 85 staff members and 35 vehicles to Wuhan, according to Sun.
其中运力14吨的大车10辆，专跑长途；25辆小车，运力1.5吨，辗转于武汉市内各家医院和处理场。
Of these, 10 carts with a capacity of 14 tons run long distances, and 25 small cars with a capacity of 1.5 tons, tossing and turning at hospitals and treatment sites in Wuhan.
小车和大车不停接力，高强度运转。
The car and cart run continuously with high intensity.
往常，一辆运力1.5吨的小型运输车，跑几家医院收集医废，才能把车厢装满。
Normally, a small truck with a capacity of 1.5 tons runs several hospitals to collect medical waste before filling the carriages.
2月份疫情最严重时，一家医院的医废就能填满一辆车，小车必须直接去处置点或者中转点清空医废，才能前往其他医院。
At the height of the epidemic in February, a hospital's waste could fill a car, which had to go directly to a disposal point or a transit point to empty it before going to another hospital.
“疫情最严重的时候，一辆车一天要从各医院到处置工厂往返3～4次。
"At the height of the epidemic, a car had to travel three to four times a day from hospitals to disposal plants.
”孙瑜说，在武汉市内，工作人员要忙到晚上八九点才能停下来。
In Wuhan, staff will not be able to stop until eight or nine o'clock in the evening, she said.
同时，装满了医疗废物的大车正在赶回工厂的路上，深夜十二点左右到，卸完车，把空桶、中转桶装回车上，已经是凌晨1、2点。
At the same time, a cart full of medical waste was on its way back to the factory. It was 1 or 2 a. m., when the truck had been unloaded and empty barrels and barrels were being loaded back into the truck.
到了下午，司机继续开车回武汉，开始新一轮接力。
In the afternoon, the driver continued to drive back to Wuhan, began a new relay.
医疗垃圾太多，医废桶也很快告急。
There was too much medical waste, and the bucket was fast running out.
来到武汉之后，中油环保分三次采购了5000个医废桶，240升的大容量，齐腰高，一次性投放到武汉。
Wuhan, China oil environmental protection in three procurement of 5,000 waste barrels, 240 litres of large capacity, waist-high, one-time into Wuhan.
医废桶是周转容器，清运车到医院，医疗垃圾不能从桶里倒出来，而是要直接将桶装载到车上，运到处理厂，卸载下来后消毒，再返还到医院。
Instead of being emptied from the bucket, the garbage can is loaded directly onto the vehicle, transported to the treatment plant, unloaded and disinfected, and returned to the hospital.
孙瑜介绍，“比如说，一家医院装载一天的医废量，需要500个桶，那我们就得备下1000个。
"For example, if a hospital carries 500 barrels a day of medical waste, we will have to reserve 1,000," Sun said.
这是额外投入，实际上平常用到的桶并不多。
This is an extra input, and not many barrels are actually used in practice.
”医院最初也难以招架，医废堆积如山却运不出去，在武汉多个定点医院都曾出现过。
"Hospitals were also initially difficult to rack, the accumulation of medical waste mountain can not get out, in Wuhan a number of designated hospitals have appeared.
武汉优抚医院是当地一家二级医院，2月14日，被列为新冠肺炎患者定点救治医院，增加了900张床位。
Wuhan Youcai Hospital is a local level II hospital, February 14, was listed as the new crown pneumonia patients targeted treatment hospital, an increase of 900 beds.
随后，医废产生量大增。
Subsequently, medical waste generation increased significantly.
武汉汉氏环保工程有限公司是武汉市唯一一家具备处理医疗废物资质的企业。
Wuhan Hanshi Environmental Protection Engineering Co. Ltd is the only enterprise in Wuhan that has qualified to deal with medical waste.
疫情期间，公司早已超负荷运转。
The company was already overloaded during the epidemic.
该公司一名员工曾对媒体表示，公司目前每天处理约2500多箱医疗垃圾，接近疫情前的两倍。
An employee of the company told the media that the company now handles about 2,500 cases of medical waste a day, nearly double the pre-epidemic level.
武汉本地处理能力严重不足，开始向外地寻求增援。
Wuhan seriously inadequate local processing capacity, began to seek assistance from the outside world.
起初，中油环保只是受武汉委托，支援医废的清运。
At first, China Oils environmental protection was only commissioned by Wuhan to support the clean-up of medical waste.
2月上旬，除了运输，他们还要负责将一部分医疗垃圾运回相应工厂，焚烧处理。
In early February, in addition to transportation, they were also responsible for returning some of the medical waste to their respective factories and burning it.
除了中油环保，环境部南京所、南京中船绿洲环保有限公司等省外单位也都参与了运输和处置医疗废物。
In addition to CNPC environmental protection, the Ministry of the Environment Nanjing Institute, Nanjing Oasis Environmental Protection Co. Ltd. and other provincial units are involved in the transport and disposal of clinical waste.
进入3月，疫情趋缓，医废处理的高峰也随之过去了。
In March, the epidemic has slowed down and the peak of waste disposal has passed.
孙瑜说，目前不再满负荷运转，“清运车到医院，医疗垃圾开始装不满一车了，有的车甚至当天不用出去转运垃圾了。
Now that the system is no longer operating at full capacity, "medical waste is beginning to load up to less than a load," Sun said. "Some cars don't even have to go out to transfer rubbish that day.
”长期被忽视：支出大、收益小、落地难有专家指出，此次疫情中，医废处置能力和支撑技术都存在问题。
Long-term neglect: big spending, low returns, difficult to land experts point out that waste disposal capacity and supporting technology are both problematic in this outbreak.
生态环境部环境规划院环境工程部主任孙宁概括为“三缺乏一隐患”。
Environmental Engineering Department of the Ministry of Ecological Environment and Planning Director Sun Ning summed up as "three lack of a hidden danger."
“三缺乏”是指缺乏医疗废物应急设施、缺乏医疗废物转运车辆和转运箱、缺乏应急设施现场处置人员。
The "three shortages" refer to the lack of emergency medical waste facilities, the lack of medical waste transfer vehicles and containers, and the lack of on-site emergency facility disposal personnel.
“一隐患”是指处置设施、处置效果方面，难以达到正常情况下环境排放标准要求。
"A hidden danger" refers to the disposal facilities, disposal effect, it is difficult to meet normal environmental emission standards.
火神山和雷神山采用的应急焚烧处置设施，总体技术水平较低，设施体系不健全，给环境和现场操作人员身心健康带来隐患和威胁。
The emergency incinerator disposal facilities in Flamingo Hill and Luishen Mountain are of low level of technology and inadequate facilities system, posing hidden dangers and threats to the physical and mental health of the environment and operators on site.
同时废物具体类型复杂，含水量比正常情况下收集废物的含水量明显偏高，对焚烧设施的运营不利。
At the same time, the concrete waste types are complex, the water content is higher than the normal water content of the collected waste, which is unfavorable to the operation of incineration facilities.
不仅是武汉，全国各地医疗废除处理能力也暴露了不同程度的短板。
Not only Wuhan, but also across the country's medical abolition treatment capacity also exposed different degrees of short board.
生态环境部应急办主任赵群英介绍，疫情以来，全国22个城市医疗废物处理在超负荷运行，还有28个城市是满负荷和接近满负荷运行。
Zhao Qunying, director of the emergency department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said that since the outbreak, 22 cities across the country have been operating under overload, and 28 more cities are operating at full capacity and near full capacity.
在上海同济大学循环经济研究所所长杜欢政看来，这次暴露出的问题，更主要不是技术上的，“是管理的问题。
Du Huangzhong, director of the Institute of Circular Economics at Tongji University in Shanghai, said the problems exposed were not primarily technical but "managerial."
”首先是缺乏医废应急处置的意识。
First, there is a lack of emergency medical waste disposal awareness.
杜欢政告诉《中国新闻周刊》，不少政府和医疗机构对重大疫情是否会发生抱有侥幸心理，“大家觉得，平时能应付过去就好了，对应急处置的认识不到位。
Du told China News Weekly that many governments and medical organizations were left to chance of a major outbreak. "It was felt that we should be able to deal with the past in normal times, and that the understanding of emergency response is not in place.
”还有的城市管理者有应急意识，但更在乎成本。
Some city managers have a sense of urgency, but care more about costs.
大多数地方在安排资金时，只考虑现有医废处置，不会考虑对医废处置的应急能力进行拨款。
In most places, only existing medical and waste disposal is considered when arranging funds, and no provision is made for emergency medical and waste disposal capacity.
2003年“非典”后，国务院批准实施《全国危险废物和医疗废物处置设施建设规划》，要求以地级市为单位，集中建设运营医疗废物集中处置设施。
After SARS in 2003, the State Council approved the implementation of the National Plan for the Construction of Hazardous Wastes and Medical Waste Disposal Facilities, which calls for the establishment and operation of centralized facilities for the treatment of medical waste, with cities at the local level as the unit.
但实际上，即使过去17年，并非每个地方都能做到。
In practice, however, not every place has been able to do so, even over the past 17 years.
2017年11月2日，国家卫健委曾公布，全国还有近1/5的地级城市无医疗废物集中处理单位。
On 2 November 2017, the National Health Commission announced that nearly one fifth of the country's municipalities had no centralized units for the treatment of medical waste.
最主要的原因，关乎成本和收益。
The most important reason is the cost and benefit.
医废处置行业，支出大、收益小。
Waste disposal industry, large expenditure, small income.
杜欢政解释，有的地方平时医废量不多，单独建设处置设施，企业规模太小，难以盈利。
Du Huangsheng explained that in some places, the amount of medical waste is not much, separate construction disposal facilities, enterprise size is too small to make profits.
现实中，一些城市会将医疗垃圾运往附近城市的处置企业。
In reality, some cities ship medical waste to disposal companies in nearby cities.
但是这会带来极大隐患：一些城市为了节约运输成本，会分出一些被认为没有危害的医废，当做生活垃圾丢弃，其中一些可能重新流入市场。
But there is a big danger that some cities, in an effort to cut transport costs, will siphon off some of the waste deemed harmless and discard it as domestic waste, with some of it likely to re-enter the market.
2019年的3·15晚会，央视曾曝光了河南省濮阳县的医疗废物处置黑色产业链：未被集中无害化处置的医疗废物被加工成破碎料，卖给下游企业，加工成塑料网袋、菜袋、洗脸盆、卫生盆等日用品。
At the March 15 evening of 2019, CCTV exposed the black industrial chain for the disposal of medical waste in Pu Yang County, Henan Province: medical waste not disposed of in a concentrated and harmless manner was processed into scrap and sold to downstream enterprises and processed into plastic mesh bags, vegetable bags, washbasins, sanitary basins and other daily necessities.
医废处置项目落地难，也是长久以来困扰行业的问题。
Waste disposal project landing is difficult, is also a long-standing problem plaguing the industry.
即使能达标排放，医废处置项目也很难被周边居民接受。
Even if can achieve the standard discharge, the medical waste disposal project is also very difficult to accept by the surrounding residents.
2011年，《人民日报》曾报道，6年时间，选址20多处，湖南湘潭医废集中处置中心项目因村民反对，无法开工。
In 2011, the People's Daily reported that over a period of six years, more than 20 sites were selected and the Hunan Xiangtan Hospital Waste Centralized Disposal Centre project could not start work because villagers objected.
“各种问题交织在一起，常规的处置项目都难以落地，更别说考虑应急状态。
"Problems are so intertwined that conventional disposal projects are hard to land, let alone emergency situations.
”杜欢政说。
"said Du.
此次疫情将医废处置困境进一步放大。
This epidemic will further amplify the dilemma of waste disposal.
近日，卫生健康委联合生态环境部等十个部门，联合印发《医疗废弃物综合治理工作方案》，要求到今年年底，每个地级市都要建成一个规范的处理医疗垃圾的处置场。
In recent days, the Health Commission, together with ten other departments, including the Ministry of Ecological Environment, has jointly issued the Work Program for the Integrated Management of Medical Waste, which requires that by the end of this year, each prefecture-level city should have a standardized disposal site for medical waste.
应急能力也需要提升。
Emergency response capacity also needs to be upgraded.
杜欢政建议，有些地方正常容量是50吨，建设时，可以设计成60吨处理能力，适当大一点，兼顾成本。
Du suggested that some places with normal capacity of 50 tons, when built, can be designed to 60 tons of treatment capacity, appropriately large, taking into account costs.
对一些医废产生量不大的城市，未来可使用移动式处理方法解决。
In the future, mobile treatment can be used to solve the problem in some cities where the amount of medical waste produced is small.
应急时，这些移动设备能灵活调往有需要的城市。
In case of emergency, these mobile devices can be flexibly transferred to cities in need.
