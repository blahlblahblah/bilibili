澎湃新闻记者 陈斯斯 栾晓娜在上海，已经治愈出院的新冠肺炎患者要如何随访？上海市公共卫生临床中心康复随访门诊医生林逸骁告诉澎湃新闻记者，3月3日上午，他一共随访了20多位患者。
Pang journalist Luan Si-lang in Shanghai, has cured patients discharged from the new crown pneumonia how to follow up? Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre rehabilitation follow-up doctor Xiao Xiao peer told Peng Pai, March 3 morning, he followed a total of more than 20 patients.
按照国家要求，所有患者在出院两周后都要到医院来随访，而上海标准就是希望他们能够尽早来随访，万一出现咽拭子阳性等所谓“复发”病人，或者有其他问题，可以尽早发现。
According to state requirements, all patients come to the hospital for follow-up two weeks after discharge, and the Shanghai standard is to expect them to come as soon as possible, in the event of a so-called "relapse," such as swabs positive, or other problems that can be detected early.
但到目前为止，并没有发现复阳的病人。
But so far, no patients have been found in Fuyang.
Play视频记者 邹桥 陈斯斯 编辑 曾茵子(01:40)上海：建议出院后一周和三周都要随访“患者出院后7-14天，就要到我们这边进行第一次随访，随访项目包括咽拭子、胸部CT、血常规等。
SAN JONES (01: 40) SHANGHAI: It is recommended that patients be followed up within a week and three weeks after they are discharged from hospital. The patient will come here for the first follow-up visit including swabs, chest CT, blood routines, etc.
” 林逸骁表示，通过对患者的血液、CT、小便等进行一系列检查，发现可能会对病毒感染或本身基础性疾病产生的一些指标上的异常。
Master peer said that through a series of blood, CT, urine and other patients, found that the virus infection or its underlying disease caused by a number of indicators.
他还表示，刚开始对第一批出院病人做门诊随访时，并没有做咽拭子，但是后来，广州、武汉等地有出院病人出现复阳的情况，上海便马上开始对所有患者进行咽拭子的随访，对有些患者还会进行大便的检查。
He said he had not swabbed his pharynx at the start of the first outpatient follow-up visits to patients discharged from hospitals in Guangzhou and Wuhan, but that Shanghai immediately began to follow up on all patients with pharyngeal swabs and, in some cases, stool examination.
上海的出院病人，门诊随访的频率是怎么样的？“国家的标准是出院后两周，我们上海是建议出院后一周和三周都要入院随访。
What is the frequency of outpatient follow-up for patients discharged from Shanghai The state standard is that two weeks after discharge, we in Shanghai recommend hospitalization for both a week and three weeks after discharge.
”林逸骁告诉记者，三周以后根据病人的恢复情况，如果CT显示，病灶都吸收很好了，其他指标也比较正常了，也就没必要一直让病人接受这些检查了。
Xiao Xiao peer told reporters, three weeks later according to the patient's recovery, if CT shows that the focus is well absorbed, other indicators are more normal, there is no need to keep patients under these tests.
但如果在随访检查中，显示肺部CT不好或者有其他指标异常，肯定会建议再来复查。
However, if the follow-up showed poor CT or other abnormalities in the lung, a second review would be recommended.
上海所有复查病人无一例咽拭子复阳根据要求，病人出院后要自家隔离满14天，那么，上海建议7天后就去医院进行随访，会不会有潜在的风险？林逸骁对此表示，他们会根据病人的实际情况，和病人沟通。
Shanghai all review patients without a pharyngeal swab Fuyang As required, patients after discharge from the hospital to their own isolation for 14 days, then Shanghai recommended seven days to go to the hospital follow-up, will not be a potential risk?
第一，要看有没有症状，如果出现了发烧、咳嗽等症状，那肯定是越早看越好，不能因为一定要居家隔离满14天，就不看病了。
First, to see if there are symptoms, if there is a fever, cough and other symptoms, it is certainly better to see the sooner, not because must be isolated at home for 14 days, do not see a doctor.
另外，病人在出院时，是符合了多项标准，包括核酸检测连续两次阴性等，才可以解除隔离出院的。
In addition, patients discharged from hospital after meeting a number of criteria, including nucleic acid testing negative twice in a row, before being released from isolation.
“出院后又隔离了7天以后，如果病人有意愿，希望尽早来复查，我们会建议他们自驾车，或联系好社区护送，尽量减少对公众的影响。
"After seven days of isolation, if the patient wishes to come back as soon as possible, we will advise them to drive their own car or contact the community escort to minimise the impact on the public.
”林逸骁告诉记者，绝大多数来随访的病人，都是自驾车或社区安排好了过来，也有病人打车过来。
Xiao Xiao peer told reporters, the vast majority of patients to follow up, are self-driving or community arrangements over, there are patients taxi to come.
在这个过程中，医生都会叮嘱他们，一定要戴好口罩。
In this process, the doctor will tell them to wear a mask.
“到目前为止，上海所有的复查病人，没有一例是咽拭子复阳的。
"So far, none of the patients reviewed in Shanghai has been swabbed by pharynx.
”林逸骁表示，即使是按广州等地的研究，有的病人虽然出院后复阳，但并没有传染给最亲近的人。
Master peer said that even according to the research in Guangzhou and other places, some patients although discharged from the hospital Fuyang, but did not infect the closest people.
因此，患者在7-14天来医院门诊进行复查是安全的。
Therefore, it is safe for patients to come to the hospital clinic for a review within 7-14 days.
出院后一个月内尽量居家休养从已开展两周的门诊随访情况看，有什么需要提醒出院患者的？林逸骁说，出院患者中，也有人有一些不舒服的症状，绝大多数患者咳嗽较多，有些存在慢性咽炎、慢性支气管炎，需要逐渐恢复，也有些存在胸闷、心悸，还有些患者基础性疾病多，医生帮他们调整控制，还有患者存在心理焦虑，担心会复发传染给其他人，医生会告诉他们不要有这种担心。
After discharge from the hospital within one month as far as possible home rest and recuperation from the two-week out-patient follow-up, there are some patients out of hospital, some patients cough more, some chronic pharyngitis, chronic bronchitis, need to recover gradually, some patients have chest tightness, palpitations, and other patients have many basic diseases, doctors help them adjust their control, and patients have psychological anxiety, fear of relapse to other people, doctors will tell them not to have such fears.
“这是一个新的疾病，对于所有患者来说，康复期过程的整个表现是什么样的，我们都还在摸索过程中。
"It's a new disease, and for all patients, we're still trying to figure out what the whole recovery process is all about.
”林逸骁告诉记者，因此，对于新冠肺炎来讲，复查是非常重要的，希望所有出院病人都能到医院来做一次随访复查。
Xiao Xiao peer told reporters, so, for the new crown pneumonia, review is very important, hope that all discharged patients can go to the hospital for a follow-up review.
“有些出院患者可能会认为，我已经好了，不需要复查了，但我们发现，有些病人在住院时指标好的，但出院后可能会发生一定的异常，这是需要我们注意的。
"Some discharged patients may think I'm well enough not to need to be re-examined, but we find that some patients who are well in hospital may experience some abnormalities that need our attention.
”他说。
'he said.
林逸骁同时提醒患者，新冠肺炎毕竟是一次较重的肺炎，患者出院过程中，免疫力是下降的。
Master peer also reminded the patient, after all, the new crown pneumonia is a severe pneumonia, patients discharged from the process, immunity is reduced.
因此，不能过度乐观地把自己完全当做正常人来对待，还是要注重休养，至少在出院后一个月内，一定要注意休息，把身体调养到比较好的状态。
Therefore, we should not be overly optimistic to treat themselves as normal people, or pay attention to recuperation, at least within a month after discharge, must pay attention to rest, physical fitness to a better state.
“我们发现，有些没有把肺部病灶吸收非常好的病人，他可能自己觉得很好，就出去跑步或其他运动，这样其实会对自己的病情造成不太好的影响。
"We found that some patients who did not absorb lung lesions very well might feel good about themselves and go for a run or other exercise that would actually have a negative impact on their condition.
”林逸骁说，因此，建议出院病人在出院后一个月内还是尽量以居家休养为主，因为这段时间的免疫力偏差，万一再感染了其他病毒或细菌，影响可能会比较大。
Xiao Xiao peer said, therefore, discharged patients are advised to stay at home within a month after discharge or rest, as this period of immune deviation, in the event of re-infection with other viruses or bacteria, the impact may be greater.
