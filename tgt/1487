截至目前，还没有证据表明，此次新冠病毒疫情像SARS那样出现超级传播者事件，但医务人员感染以及防护失败的具体原因仍有待深入调查文|《财经》记者 信娜 辛颖 王小编辑|王小“虽然新型冠状病毒具有高度传染性，但大多数患者为轻症表现，粗病死率低。
So far, there is no evidence of a new outbreak of the new strain of the virus like SARS. But the exact cause of the infection and failure remains to be fully investigated. & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
”这是2020年2月17日，中国疾控中心（CDC）新型冠状病毒肺炎应急响应机制流行病学组在《中华流行病学杂志》上刊发论文给出的一个结论。
This is a conclusion drawn from a paper published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology on February 17, 2020 by the Epidemiology Unit of the China CDC's New Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Mechanism.
研究者分析了截至2020年2月11日中国内地共报告的72314病例，他们发现，85.8%例病例具有武汉暴露史。
The researchers analyzed 72,314 cases reported from the mainland of China as of February 11, 2020 and found that 85.8 percent of the cases had Wuhan history of exposure.
另外，在确诊病例44672例中，共有1023例死亡，粗病死率为2.3%。
In addition, of the 44,672 confirmed cases, 1,023 were fatal, with a crude death rate of 2.3 per cent.
湖北省的粗病死率为2.9%，高出其他省份（0.4%）7.3倍。
The crude death rate in Hubei Province was 2.9 per cent, 7.3 times higher than in other provinces (0.4 per cent).
该论文指出，此次新冠病毒疫情发的早期，令人联想到SARS和MERS，发现了一种与冠状病毒密切相关的，以前从未描述过的病原体，预示了潜在的医院传播和所谓的“超级传播者”事件。
The paper points out that the early stage of the outbreak, reminiscent of SARS and MERS, revealed a pathogen closely related to the coronavirus that had never been described before and foreshadowed potential hospital transmission and so-called "super-disseminators."
不幸的是，新冠病毒确实通过医院传播感染了医务人员，大多数病例为轻症患者（85.4%）。
Unfortunately, the new crown virus does infect medical personnel through hospital transmission, with the majority of cases being mild (85.4 per cent).
不过，截至目前，还没有证据表明，在任何一家为新冠病毒肺炎患者提供过服务的医疗机构中发生了超级传播事件。
So far, however, there has been no evidence of super-transmission in any of the health-care facilities that provide services to patients with Newcastle virus pneumonia.
“这是新发传染病，具体解除人员流动限制，需要流行病学专家根据病例情况分析计算（来决策），如感染率、发病率、病死率等指标会随着时间推移变化，且逐渐更具代表性。
"This is a newly emerging infectious disease, and specific lifting of mobility restrictions will require epidemiological experts to calculate (for decision-making purposes) indicators such as infection rates, morbidity and mortality rates that change over time and become more representative.
”原中国疾控中心传染病所研究员崔步云对《财经》记者说。
Cui Buyun, a former CDC infectious diseases researcher, told Caijing.
这篇题“新型冠状病毒肺炎流行病学特征分析”，正是通过报告的超过7万病例的流行病学特征进行研究得出。
"Epidemiological analysis of the new coronavirus pneumonia" is based on the epidemiological characteristics of more than 70,000 reported cases.
截至2月17日24时，全国现有确诊病例58016例，其中重症病例11741例，累计治愈出院病例12552例（北京核增7例），累计死亡病例1868例，累计报告确诊病例72436例（新疆生产建设兵团核增2例），现有疑似病例6242例。
As at 2400 hours on February 17, there were 58016 confirmed cases nationwide, of which 11,741 were serious cases, 12,552 cumulative cases of discharge (7 cases of nuclear increase in Beijing), 1,868 cumulative cases of death and 72,436 cases of confirmed cases (2 cases of nuclear increase in the XPCC).
累计追踪到密切接触者560901人，尚在医学观察的密切接触者141552人。
A cumulative total of 560,901 contacts were traced, with 141,552 close contacts still under medical observation.
第一个流行峰已过该论文对新冠肺炎的发病流行曲线分析得出，总体呈现暴发流行模式。
The first epidemic peak has been analyzed by the epidemiological curve of the new crown pneumonia, and the epidemic pattern appears in general.
按照全部患者的发病时间，1月24日－28日为第一个流行峰，在2月1日出现单日发病日的异常高值，然后逐渐下降。
The first epidemic peak occurred on 24-28 January, with an unusually high number of one-day days on 1 February, followed by a gradual decline, depending on the onset of all patients.
按确诊病例的发病日期和报告日期，发病人数在1月初开始迅速上升，在1月24日－28日达到第一个流行峰，后缓慢下降，但在2月1日出现单日发病日异常高值，后逐渐下降；报告病例数在1月10日后快速上升，在2月5日达到流行峰，然后缓慢下降。
The number of cases began to rise rapidly in early January, peaking at the first epidemic on 24-28 January and declining slowly, but declined after a single-day high on 1 February; the number of reported cases rose rapidly after 10 January, peaked on 5 February and then slowly decreased.
2019年12月发病的病例，可能为小范围暴露传播模式；2020年1月，可能是扩散传播模式。
The cases that occurred in December 2019 are likely to be patterns of transmission of small-scale exposure; in January 2020, they are likely to be patterns of spread.
湖北省以外病例发病高峰期为1月24日－27日。
The peak of cases outside Hubei province was 24-27 January.
68.6%的病例报告发病前14天内在武汉居住或去过武汉，或曾与武汉患者有过密切接触。
Sixty-six per cent of the cases were reported to have occurred in Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of illness or had close contact with Wuhan patients.
该论文指出，这种暴发流行的时间趋势与先前调查结论一致，即武汉华南海鲜市场可能有野生动物交易，使得新型冠状病毒从一种仍然未知的野生动物传染到人类，继而实现在人与人之间的传播。
The paper said the timing of the outbreak is consistent with previous research that a possible wildlife trade in Wuhan South China seafood market could spread the new coronavirus from an unknown wild animal to a human being, and vice versa.
总体流行曲线的下降趋势表明，限制人员流动、减少接触、多渠道高频率地传播关键的预防信息，例如洗手、戴口罩和求医信息等，以及动员多部门快速反应，有助于遏制疫情。
The downward trend in the overall prevalence curve suggests that restrictions on the movement of people, reduced exposure, multi-channel and high-frequency dissemination of key prevention messages, such as hand-washing, wearing masks and seeking medical information, as well as the mobilization of multisectoral rapid response, can help contain the epidemic.
随着人们返回工作岗位，仍需积极应对可能出现的疫情反弹。
As people return to work, there is still a need to respond positively to a possible rebound in the epidemic.
复工有三个指标作为参考，首先是病例数拐点，看每日疑似病例新增数；第二是潜伏期；第三复工对扩散的影响不会太大。
There are three indicators for returning to work, the first being the inflection point in the number of cases per day, the second being the incubation period and the third not having a significant impact on proliferation.
错峰复工，“开始恢复上班、返城、回潮肯定是会带来新增病例，有小的波动。
staggered resumption of work, "began to return to work, back to the city, the tide is sure to bring new cases, there are small fluctuations.
但是如果前期的隔离工作确实做好了，那么不会影响太大。
But if the early separation is actually done, it won't make much difference.
”一位传染病研究人员对《财经》记者分析。
An infectious-diseases researcher analyzed Caijing.
医务人员感染和防护失败原因待查明卫健委数据显示，截至2月11日24时，全国共报告医务人员确诊病例1716例，占到全国确诊病例的3.8%。
As of 2400 hours on February 11, 1,716 cases of infection and failure of medical personnel were reported nationwide, accounting for 3.8 percent of the confirmed cases nationwide.
其中有6人不幸去世，占全国死亡病例的0.4%。
Six of them died, accounting for 0.4 per cent of all deaths in the country.
其中，湖北省报告1502例医务人员确诊病例，占全国医务人员确诊病例的87.5%，武汉市报告了1102例。
Of these, 1502 confirmed cases were reported by medical personnel in Hubei Province, accounting for 87.5 percent of cases confirmed by medical personnel nationwide, and 1,102 cases were reported in Wuhan city.
上述论文指出，医务人员病例发病的高峰期可能出现在1月28日。
According to the paper, the peak of medical cases is likely to occur on January 28.
在为新冠肺炎患者提供诊治服务的422家医疗机构中，共有3019名医务人员感染了新冠病毒，其中1716名确诊病例。
A total of 3,019 out of 422 health-care facilities providing treatment for patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia have acquired the new crown virus, of which 1,716 have been confirmed.
同时，1688名医务人员确诊病例具有病情严重程度信息， 这些确诊医务人员集中在武汉（64%）和湖北其他地区（23.3%）。
At the same time, 1,688 medical personnel diagnosed with information on the severity of the disease, these confirmed medical personnel concentrated in Wuhan (64%) and other areas of Hubei (23.3%).
医务人员确诊重症比例在武汉为17.7%，湖北10.4%，全国湖北以外为7.0%。
The rate of severe cases diagnosed by medical staff was 17.7% in Wuhan, 10.4% in Hubei and 7.0% outside Hubei.
此次医患人员感染者大多数病例为轻症患者（85.4%）。
The majority of cases were mild (85.4 per cent).
主要原因与年龄有关，医务人员都是在职人员，一般都在60岁以下，而死亡主要发生在60岁以上的患者。
The main causes are age-related, with the medical staff being employed, generally under the age of 60, while the majority of deaths occur among patients over the age of 60.
医护人员感染的病死率低于其他病例。
Health-care workers have lower death rates than other cases.
整体看，新冠肺炎患者集中在30岁—79岁（86.6%），该年龄组占确诊病例总数比例，武汉市为89.8%，湖北省为88.6%，全国为86.6%。
Overall, the incidence of New Crown Pneumonia is concentrated in the 30-79 age group (86.6%), which accounts for 89.8% of confirmed cases in Wuhan city, 88.6% in Hubei province and 86.6% in China.
最易中招的是具有高血压、糖尿病、心血管疾病和呼吸道传染病的患者，比例分别为12.8%、5.3%、4.2%和2.4%。
The most common causes are hypertension (12.8 per cent), diabetes (5.3 per cent), cardiovascular diseases (4.2 per cent) and respiratory infections (2.4 per cent).
自疫情出现后，医务人员感染时时发生。
Since the outbreak, infections among medical personnel have been frequent.
武汉大学中南医院重症医学科主任彭志勇的研究样本中，1月1日到1月28日，该院138名患者确诊，有40位是医务工作者。
From January 1 to January 28, a sample of 138 patients at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, a director of the department of severe medicine, identified 40 medical workers.
其中，受感染最多的不是来自重症监护室，而是自普通科室的医护人员，共31人占比77.5%。
Of these, the most affected were not from intensive care units, but from the general service, with a total of 31 patients (77.5 per cent).
上述论文提到，截至目前，还没有证据表明，在任何一家为新型冠状病毒肺炎患者提供服务的医疗机构中发生了超级传播者事件。
So far, there has been no evidence of a 'super-spreader' incident in any of the medical facilities serving patients with the new coronavirus pneumonia, the paper said.
超级传播者事件，即一次性暴露造成10人以上的续发病例。
The Super Communicator Incident, a one-time exposure, resulted in more than 10 secondary cases.
2003年SARS疫情中，曾出现一人传染数十人的超级传播者事件。
In the SARS epidemic of 2003, there was a one-to-dozens transmission of super-carriers.
彭志勇观察认为，与SARS病毒相比，此次新冠病毒的传染性更强。
Peng Zhiyong observed that compared with the SARS virus, the new crown virus is more infectious.
早期医护被感染是因为不知道人传人，没防护，当知道人传人后，已有大量病人涌进医院，防护不够，医护面临的感染风险丝毫未减。
Early care has been infected because there is no known human-to-human transmission, no protection. When it is known that human-to-human transmission, a large number of patients have flooded the hospital with inadequate protection, leaving the risk of infection undiminished.
1月10日前后，一名患者因腹部不适，被中南医院收治。
Around 10 January, a patient was admitted to the South-Central Hospital because of abdominal discomfort.
此时，新冠病毒人传人的特点还未被官方确认。
At this point, the new crown virus human-to-human characteristics have not been officially confirmed.
在彭志勇的研究样本中，最早引发医护感染的正是这名腹病患者，他感染了相关的10余名医护人员，其中一名医生又将病毒传染给了家人。
In Peng Zhiyong's study, it was the abdominal patient who first triggered the infection, infecting more than a dozen health-care workers, one of whom passed the virus on to his family.
在早期，中南医院已加强重点科室防护。
In the early period, the central and southern hospitals have strengthened key department protection.
“疫情发展的风声很紧，院内已经预警”，彭志勇说，在可能遇到感染者的门诊、急诊和呼吸科都加强防控，让医生戴口罩。
"The spread of the epidemic is very tight, the hospital has been warned," said Pang Zhiyong, in outpatient, emergency and respiratory departments at risk of infection to strengthen prevention and control, let doctors wear masks.
上述论文指出，此次疫情中，医护人员群体也可能存在非职业暴露造成的感染。
The above-mentioned paper points out that in this epidemic, the health-care workers may also have non-occupational exposure to the infection.
但迄今为止，医务人员感染以及防护失败的具体原因仍有待深入调查。
So far, however, the specific causes of infection and failure of medical personnel have yet to be thoroughly investigated.
