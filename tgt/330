肖雅星告诉新京报记者，最早是在网上看到很多医生护士加班后在办公室和病床上睡觉的图片，觉得应该要做点什么。

At the beginning of the support alliance operation, most of the staff of Xinjing Newspaper saw the information sent by hotel staff and volunteers on the internet and contacted the hotel directly.
城市便捷连锁酒店青少年宫店主管江恒说，他起初也是把电话和酒店地址在网上公布，但后来发现这样与医护人员一一沟通耽误时间，他便与医院直接对接，“让医院内部协调好人员，集体入住，节省沟通成本。
Jiang Heng, director of the Urban Convenience Chain Hotel, said he also posted phone and hotel addresses online at first, but when he found it took time to communicate with medical staff, he docked directly with the hospital.
”他的酒店有108间房，几乎天天满房，主要住的是武汉市第六医院和协和医院的员工。
His hotel, which has 108 rooms and is almost full every day, is staffed mainly by staff at Wuhan Sixth Hospital and Concorde Hospital.
也有的医院会集中就近为员工安排酒店。

A medical worker at Wuhan Three Hospital told the Beijing News that employees who live far away and are inconvenient to return home can apply to the administrative department, which reports to the hospital union, which will contact the hotel.
据他介绍，三院的定点酒店离医院只有一公里多。
The hotel in the hospital is just over a kilometer away, he said.
安全问题，是医生驿站需要考虑的首要问题。
Safety is the first consideration in doctor's post.
城市便捷青少年宫店工作人员吴洁自上岗以来，很少见到医护人员，她组建了一个微信群，入住的医护人员都在群里，平日里基本上没有说话，除了有人问电视机怎么开、遥控器要更换电池等。
Wu Jie, an urban youth-friendly shop worker, has met few health-care workers since she took office. She has formed a small group of doctors and nurses who are in the group and usually speak little, except when asked how to turn on the TV or change the batteries for the remote control.

Visible problems and invisible risks The afterlife told reporters that the three main problems facing doctors' stations were: hotel staff, shortages of protective equipment and operating costs, in addition to security risks.

In the afterlife, as many staff return home for the holiday, the company has called on those who remain in Wuhan to return to work, with some taking 12 to 15 hours a day on duty.
”相比人力，物资的缺乏更让人担忧。
The lack of supplies is more worrying than the lack of manpower.
来世明说，医护人员虽然是高危行业，但是有专业防护和知识，酒店一线员工只有一个口罩、一瓶84消毒液，“每天都有疑似感染、后面又排除的，总怕狼真的有一天来了。
Despite their professional protection and knowledge, the front-line staff of the hotel has only one mask and 84 disinfectant. "Every day there is a suspected infection, after the exclusion, always afraid the wolf will come one day.

江恒介绍，城市便捷青少年宫店是由医院安排人员进行专业消杀，一天两次。
Jiang Heng introduced, the city convenient youth palace store is arranged by the hospital personnel to carry out professional sterilization, twice a day.
但像悦东方这样的小型酒店，医院不能提供专业消杀。
But in a small hotel like Yue Orient, hospitals can't offer professional sanitizers.
肖雅星告诉新京报记者，“单体酒店大多数没法让医院来做消杀，联系不到院领导和后勤。
Xiao told the Beijing News that "most single hotels cannot be used by hospitals to kill, without contacting hospital leaders and logistics."
”即便是让住在酒店的医护人员跟医院传话或要医院领导联系方式，都没有人能提供。
Not even the hospital staff who live in the hotel can communicate with the hospital or ask for the contact information of its leaders.

新京报记者向凯 摄即便是大型连锁酒店，成本也是困扰它们的一大问题。
Costs are also a big problem for reporters at the Beijing News, which sells even large hotel chains to Kay.
来世明介绍，目前对接的几十家酒店，除极个别政府征用的有意向提出补助外，目前大部分都没有任何补助。
At present, the dozens of hotels docked, except for a few government requisition of the intention to submit subsidies, most do not have any subsidies at present.
肖雅星的悦东方酒店属小型酒店，约有50间房，开销主要是电费，一天至少1200元。

And for the single hotel, in addition to the visible problems, but also face invisible risks and doubts.
1月27日，肖雅星团队的志愿者开车去仙桃拉一家企业捐赠的口罩、防护服等物资，由于道路禁行，出入武汉需要通行证明，他们费了好大劲从武昌区卫生健康局弄到一张通行证出了武汉，但从仙桃回武汉还要进入武汉的通行证。
On January 27, volunteers from Xiao Yaxing team drove to a nectara enterprise donated masks, protective clothing and other materials, because of the road ban, Wuhan needs to pass, they took a lot of trouble from Wuchang District Health Bureau to get a pass out of Wuhan, but from Xiantao back to Wuhan to enter Wuhan.
“物资车辆进来要医院专门的接收函，但是很多医院不肯开。
"Supplies and vehicles came in for special hospital reception letters, but many hospitals refused to open them.
”肖雅星说，很少有医院能主动提供接收函。
Few hospitals offer to receive letters, says Xiao.
“我们想要医院出具一个为他们医护人员提供免费住宿的公函证明，很多医院都不愿意。
"We want an official letter from the hospital that provides free accommodation for their staff," he said. "Many hospitals are reluctant.
”肖雅星说，自从支援联盟呼吁为医护人员提供住宿以来，手套、口罩、防护服等，都需要自己解决。
Mr. Xiao said gloves, masks and protective clothing needed to be addressed by the support group since it called for medical staff to be accommodated.
酒店缺防护物资，她便组织志愿者一个一个厂家打电话问，筹集运输车去把消毒水运回来，装消毒水的桶都是东挪西借才找到。
The hotel is short of protective materials, she organized volunteers one factory after another to ask, to collect a transport truck to transport back the disinfectant water, disinfectant barrels are found everywhere.
此外，酒店还面临着外面的流言蜚语，“比如有人说我们店里住了感染的医护人员，这样传来传去，以后生意肯定没法做了。
In addition, the hotel is faced with rumors outside that "someone said we had an infected paramedic in the store and it was passed on so that business would not be done."
还有不少酒店的工作人员听说老板接待了医护人员，都离职不回来上班。
There are also many hotel staff heard that the boss has received medical staff, are unable to leave work.
”肖雅星说。
"said Xiao Yaoxing.
转场再战，为社区提供防护物资1月31日，支援联盟宣布159家单体酒店、民宿、公寓和小型连锁酒店将不再接待医护人员和客人，并在1月31日18点前清空房间，做好消毒工作的准备。

支援联盟公告显示，停止服务的主要是单体酒店、民宿等，其余62家酒店以及包括东呈在内的大型连锁酒店继续为医护人员提供住宿。
According to the Support Alliance announcement, the remaining 62 hotels, as well as major hotel chains including the East, continue to provide accommodation for medical staff.
据来世明的观察，现在政府部门正在摸排各区域酒店情况，有统筹安排的趋势。
According to the observation of afterlife, now the government departments are mapping out the regional hotel situation, there is a trend of integrated arrangements.
“每个区有一个指挥中心，对辖区酒店进行摸排，如果酒店符合要求就会来跟酒店协调。
"Each district has a command center that maps the hotel in its area and coordinates with the hotel if it meets the requirements.
”医务人员的出行条件也在改善，武汉市组织了免费公交和滴滴打车，专门服务医护人员。
Conditions for medical staff are also improving, and Wuhan City has organized free public transport and drip-drip taxis to serve medical staff.
1月29日，一名武汉市中心医院后湖园区的医护人员告诉新京报记者，公交车已经开始运行，专门接送医护人员上下班。
On January 29, a medical worker at the Houhu District of Wuhan Central Hospital told the Beijing News that the bus had started to run and transport medical personnel to and from work.
全国各地的医疗救援队到来之后，医护人员的工作强度有所减缓。
The arrival of medical rescue teams throughout the country has reduced the intensity of the work of medical personnel.
在准备退出的同时，肖雅星已经开始另一项工作——她和志愿者们通过之前募集到的资金为支援联盟里的159家小型酒店购买整体消杀服务，而她作为一个民间组织者积累的社会资源、筹集的物资，将提供给最紧缺的社区。
As she prepares to quit, Xiao has begun another project, in which she and her volunteers use the money raised to buy a holistic antiseptic service for 159 small hotels in the support league, while her accumulated social resources and resources as a civic organizer will go to the neediest communities.
“现在最希望的是把事情做到有始有终。
"The best thing to do now is to stay the course.
”按照武汉市政府安排，社区承担了筛查、隔离和运送发热病人的工作，成为接触发热病人的最先一道防线。
Under the Wuhan municipal government, communities have taken on the task of screening, quarantining and transporting febrile patients, becoming the first line of defence in reaching febrile patients.
肖雅星介绍，“物资捐赠从基层开始，先满足基层社区再到机关。
"Material donation starts at the grass-roots level and first satisfies the grass-roots community and then the authorities," Xiao said.
”最近几天，他们捐赠给政府部门、医院、社区服务中心、酒店的物资，每捐赠一批物资，都要进行拍照、登记，让对方提供接收证明和盖章，“因为之前出现过冒领的情况。
"In recent days, they have donated goods to government departments, hospitals, community service centers and hotels. Every donation must be photographed, registered and sealed by the recipient," because of previous cases of counterfeiting.
”1月30日，捐赠给社区的口罩和防护服。
On January 30, masks and protective clothing were donated to the community.
新京报记者向凯 摄在靠近武昌火车站的一个小院子里，有一家肖雅星经营的酒店，由于位置比较偏僻，没有接待医务人员，肖雅星将从外地运回的物资放在这里，再分配。
In a small courtyard near Wuchang railway station, reporters for the Beijing News reported that there was a hotel run by Xiao Yaxing, which, because of its remote location, did not receive medical staff.
一名从事酒店布草洗涤工作的志愿者运回来两个一吨重的装水容器，调配消毒水。
A volunteer who worked as a laundry service for the hotel brought back two one-ton water containers to mix the disinfectant.
肖雅星告诉记者，虽然159家单体酒店、民宿、公寓和小型连锁酒店将不再接待医护人员，但其余的112家连锁酒店将继续为医护人员提供住宿服务。
Xiao told reporters that while 159 individual hotels, residences, apartments and small hotel chains will no longer receive medical staff, the remaining 112 hotel chains will continue to provide accommodation for medical staff.
按评估，即使停止部分单体酒店、小型连锁酒店等接待工作，应该也能满足目前需求。
According to the assessment, even if the suspension of some single hotels, small hotel chains and other reception work, should also be able to meet the current demand.
“我们还在考虑，如何为加入的这些酒店拓宽推广渠道。
"We're also thinking about how we can broaden our marketing channels for these hotels.
