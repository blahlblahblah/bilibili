现在我的妈妈再和我视频，我会告诉她，事实证明她看到的电视新闻是假的。
Now that my mom is on video with me again, I'll tell her that the TV news she saw turned out to be fake.
儿子在上海很安全就是最好的证明。
The best proof is that my son is safe in Shanghai.
尽管她还是每天看电视新闻，但真的不哭了。
Although she watches the news on TV every day, she really doesn't cry.
口述 |塔瑞克整理 |姜浩峰我是塔瑞克（Tariq），上海师范大学本科二年级的留学生，来自也门。
I am Tariq, a sophomore at Shanghai Normal University, from Yemen.
今年放寒假，我没有回国，而是选择留在上海。
This winter vacation, I did not return to China, but chose to stay in Shanghai.
在新冠肺炎疫情起来的时候，远在也门的我的父母，我的姐姐、弟弟妹妹们都为我担忧。
My parents, my sisters, brothers and sisters in Yemen were worried about me when the outbreak of pneumonia began.
其中，最为我担忧的就是我的妈妈。
Of these, my mother is the one I worry most about.
1月下旬的时候，我的妈妈每天看电视。
In late January, my mother watched TV every day.
我们也门能看到一些西方电视频道。
We can see some Western TV channels in Yemen.
我妈妈看了那些电视上对中国疫情的报道，非常害怕。
My mother watched the TV coverage of the epidemic in China and was very scared.
在视频连线中，她总是在哭，要我抓紧回国。
In the video link, she is always crying, I hasten to return to the country.
我知道她担心什么。
I know what she's worried about.
我告诉妈妈，这些电视上的东西都是假的！我呆在上海很安全。
I told my mother that all the things on TV were fake! I was safe in Shanghai.
中国湖北省的武汉确实有疫情，我们上海也看得到报道，并且每天都看得到武汉、全中国和世界各地新冠肺炎确诊、疑似人数的变化。
Wuhan in Hubei Province of China does have an epidemic situation, and we in Shanghai can see the change in the number of confirmed and suspected cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, all over China and around the world every day.
我告诉家人，武汉的病例多，我自己在上海则很安全。
I told my family that Wuhan had many cases and that I was safe in Shanghai myself.
我在暑假期间刚回过也门，这次寒假就不回国了。
I just returned to Yemen during the summer vacation, this winter vacation will not return home.
塔瑞克妈妈一开始确实非常担心我的健康。
Turek's mother was really worried about my health at first.
可通过视频，她看到我身体健康，情绪稳定，逐渐化解了这种担心。
But through the video, she saw that I was healthy and emotionally stable, gradually defusing this concern.
我们上海师范大学这里，在1月下旬也开始做一些封闭校门的措施。
Here at Shanghai Normal University, we also began to close our doors in late January.
一开始，我确实觉得不习惯，感觉不是很好。
At first, I really didn't get used to it and I didn't feel very good.
可逐渐地，我发现学校真是为我们学生好。
But gradually, I found that the school was really good for us students.
比如宿管阿姨天天来为我们量体温；老师在线答疑，但不派我们做任何要出校完成的事。
For example, Aunt Cebu comes every day to take our temperature. The teacher answers questions online, but doesn't send us to do anything we have to do outside school.
作为一个来自阿拉伯国家的留学生，我能吃到学校清真食堂的饭菜。
As an international student from Arab countries, I can eat the meals in the school halal canteen.
校园里的超市也开着。
Supermarkets on campus are open, too.
学校甚至提前发放了2月份的奖学金。
The school even offered scholarships for February ahead of schedule.
我把这些情况都和家里说了。
I told the whole story to my family.
我爸爸妈妈听说之后，也就放心了。
My parents were relieved when they heard about it.
爸爸还特地写了一封感谢信给上海师大。
Dad also wrote a thank-you note to Shanghai Normal University.
当我把这封阿拉伯语的感谢信翻译成英语给到学校国际交流处留学生办公室时，老师们很惊讶——这时候竟然收到这么一封家长来信。
When I translated this letter of thanks in Arabic into English for the Office of Foreign Students at the International Exchanges Office, the teachers were surprised when I received such a letter from my parents.
塔瑞克告诉上海师大国际交流处老师，爸爸发来一封“跨国家长信”我爸爸在信中写道：“自从我得知新型冠状病毒在中国传播后，我们一家都非常焦虑。
"Ever since I learned that the new coronavirus has been spreading in China, our family has been very worried," his father wrote to a teacher at the International Exchanges Office of Shanghai Normal University.
我劝儿子早日回国。
I urge my son to return home soon.
但令我感到惊讶的是，他说他很安全，没必要因为这个事情回国。
But to my surprise, he said he was safe and there was no need to return home because of it.
学校并没有让他失望，所有留校的学生得到了学校的极大关注，还求我不用再担心他的安全。
The school didn't disappoint him. All the students who stayed in school got a lot of attention from the school and asked me to stop worrying about his safety.
我对此感到非常放心，也让我对中国这个伟大的国家感到非常感激。
I feel very reassured about this, and let me also be very grateful to China, a great country.
”其实，我之所以能到中国留学，是受了爸爸很大的影响。
"Actually, the reason why I was able to study in China was greatly influenced by my father.
我读高中的时候，我们也门正值战乱。
When I was in high school, we were at war in Yemen.
当时在我们国家，如果一个高中生成绩优秀，很大概率会想方设法出国去读大学。
In my country, if a high school student got good grades, he would try his best to go abroad to go to college.
当时，我和同学商量，大家都想去荷兰留学。
At that time, I discussed with my classmates, we all want to study in Holland.
我把想法告诉了爸爸。
I told Dad what I thought.
爸爸给我的建议是去中国。
My father's advice to me is to go to China.
我的爸爸是一名历史老师。
My father is a history teacher.
他的看法很有见地。
His views are very insightful.
在当时的我心目中，他是个什么都知道的人。
In my mind at the time, he was a man who knew everything.
他告诉我，中国现在跑得很快。
He told me that China is running very fast now.
中国这么一个大国、古国，跑得这么快，未来一定有很多机会。
China is such a big country and an ancient country, it runs so fast that there must be a lot of opportunities in the future.
爸爸告诉我：“塔瑞克，你有很多梦想。
Dad told me, "Tarek, you have a lot of dreams.
对你来说，最适合圆梦的地方就是中国！”塔瑞克父亲写给上海师大的信当时在也门，我对中国也是有不少印象的。
For you, the best place to interpret a dream is in China.My father's letter to Masters University in Shanghai was in Yemen at the time, and I was impressed with China.
比如中国人帮我们造了很多桥梁。
For example, the Chinese have built many bridges for us.
我们当地最大的一个医院也是中国人造的。
The biggest hospital in our area is also made in China.
于是我接受了爸爸的建议。
So I accepted my father's advice.
就这样，我真的来到了中国。
In this way, I really came to China.
一来到上海，我就喜欢上了这座城市。
As soon as I came to Shanghai, I fell in love with the city.
我先在同济大学学中文课程。
I studied Chinese at Tongji University first.
那时候就认识了一位中国朋友。
I got to know a Chinese friend at that time.
后来，我还去这个朋友家玩，他们家人都把我当自己人，我觉得特别开心。
Later, I also went to this friend's home to play, their families take me as their own, I feel particularly happy.
经过8个月的中文学习以后，我来到了在也门填报志愿的上海师范大学。
After eight months of studying Chinese, I went to Shanghai Normal University to volunteer in Yemen.
我就读的专业是信息与机电工程。
My major is Information and Mechanical Engineering.
今年寒假，我的在上海的也门同学们，有不少人回国了。
This winter vacation, many of my Yemeni classmates in Shanghai have returned home.
这是他们本身计划好的。
It was planned by them.
我之所以没有回国，本身是因为去年寒假期间，曾经为一些也门公司做过翻译工作等。
I did not return home because I worked as an interpreter for some Yemeni companies during the winter vacation last year.
本想这个寒假再接受一些历练。
I would like to take some more experience this winter vacation.
现在疫情来了，我只能呆在宿舍里。
Now that the outbreak is here, I can only stay in the dormitory.
不过，好歹学校的安排特别周密，我的感觉还不错。
However, the good or bad school arrangements are particularly elaborate, I feel good.
举个例子，在疫情防控措施实施以后，我们学校老师给我们留学生分别建了几个微信群——会阿拉伯语的一个群，会俄语的一个群……大家在群里聊天，原本来自不同国家、不认识的同学，现在认识了，还在群里聊得很嗨。
For example, after the implementation of the epidemic prevention and control measures, our school teachers set up several micro-groups for our foreign students - an Arabic-speaking group, a Russian-speaking group... everyone was chatting in the group.

我发现，他们的学校也给他们安排得很好。
I found out that their school also arranged for them very well.
包括吃饭、学习等等方面的问题，学校都考虑得很周详。
The school thought very carefully about everything from eating to studying.
虽然那边疫情暂时有点严重，但只要个人不随便出门，就能够安全。
Although the epidemic there is a little serious for the time being, as long as individuals do not go out freely, can be safe.
现在我的妈妈再和我视频，我会告诉她，事实证明她看到的电视新闻是假的。
Now that my mom is on video with me again, I'll tell her that the TV news she saw turned out to be fake.
儿子在上海很安全就是最好的证明。

尽管她还是每天看电视新闻，但真的不哭了。
