澎湃新闻记者 黄霁洁 实习生 陈媛媛2月7日凌晨2点58分，武汉市中心医院眼科医生李文亮因感染新冠肺炎离世。
Liu Yuanyuan, an intern with a large newspaper, died February 7 at 2: 58 a.m. of Liu Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital.
李文亮的离世触动了众多关切，为何原本病情平稳或好转的新冠肺炎患者，却在短期突然恶化？李文亮于1月10日出现咳嗽症状，12日住院。
Li Wenliang's death touched many concerns about why a patient with pneumonia, which had stabilized or improved, suddenly deteriorated in a short period of time.
治疗近一个月后的2月3日，他曾在大学群里发言，说自己早上血气好些了，氧分压100，还是不能动，一动就喘，其他还好，估计两周后出院。
Almost a month later, on February 3, he spoke to a group of university students. He said he was better in the morning, oxygen pressure was 100, or he could not move, he gasped.
一度好转，5日，他的病情却骤然直下。
Once better, on the 5th, his condition suddenly straightened out.
6日，在武汉市中心医院后湖院区，重症医生采用ECMO（体外膜氧合肺，俗称人工肺）为李文亮进行支持，但最终未能抢救回来。
6, Wuhan city central hospital Houhu courtyard district, severe doctors used ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygen lung, commonly known as artificial lung) to support Li Wenliang, but ultimately failed to rescue him.
这一现象并非孤例。
This phenomenon is not alone.
1月29日，一项针对金银潭医院1月1日至1月20日的所有新冠肺炎确诊病例的研究发表于医学杂志《柳叶刀》。
On January 29, a study of all confirmed cases of pneumonia in the gold and silver pool hospital from January 1 to January 20 was published in the medical journal Lancet.
研究显示，99个病例中，17名患者出现急性呼吸窘迫综合征，其中，11例患者病情在短时间内恶化，死于多器官衰竭。
The study showed that 17 out of 99 cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome, of which 11 cases deteriorated within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.
1月24日，在武汉大学中南医院重症隔离病房，医护人员为病人治疗。
January 24, in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital intensive care unit, hospital staff for the treatment of patients.
新华社 图2月7日，另一项武汉大学中南医院在医学杂志《JAMA》发表的针对138个住院病例的回顾性研究显示，新冠肺炎从最初出现症状到呼吸困难需要的中位时间为5天，到住院需7天，到急性呼吸窘迫综合征需8天。
Another retrospective study of 138 hospitalized cases published in the medical journal JAMA by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital on Feb. 7 showed that the median time between onset of symptoms and dyspnea was five days, hospitalization seven days and acute respiratory distress syndrome eight days.
对此，一些专家提出“炎症风暴”的解释，也称细胞因子风暴，意指某些病毒感染或当机体免疫功能异常时，促炎性细胞因子持续大量产生，不断活化更多的免疫细胞聚集到炎症部位，过多的免疫细胞及多种促炎细胞因子引起组织充血、水肿、发热、损伤，还可能引起其它继发性感染甚至导致“全身炎症反应综合征”，最终患者因多器官衰竭而死亡。
In response, some experts have proposed an explanation for "inflammatory storms," also known as cytokine storms, which mean that certain viral infections or inflammatory cytokines continue to proliferate when the body's immune function is abnormal. Excessive immune cells and a variety of inflammatory cytokines cause congestion, oedema, fever, injury and possibly other secondary infections and even systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
澎湃新闻查询发现，“炎症风暴”并非一个新的概念，一篇2015年发表在《生命科学》上的论文《细胞因子风暴：急性呼吸窘迫综合征中的主宰生命之手》指出，多种病毒感染，如SARS冠状病毒、2009 甲型H1N1流感病毒、禽流感病毒，以及某些纳米材料，均可导致细胞因子风暴，进而引起ARDS（急性呼吸窘迫综合征），而ARDS的病死率达40%-70%。
A 2015 paper published in Life Sciences, Cytokine Storm: The Hand of Dominant Life in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, found that a number of viral infections, such as SARS coronavirus, H1N1 2009, avian influenza virus, and some nanomaterials, can cause cytokine storms that cause ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), while ARDS has a mortality rate of 40-70%.
2月9日，澎湃新闻对话在武汉金银潭医院支援的上海中山医院重症医学科副主任钟鸣、武汉大学中南医院呼吸与危重症医学科主任程真顺、黄冈市中心医院呼吸内科副主任黄虎翔，试图进一步揭示“炎症风暴”。
February 9, Pai news dialogue in Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital support of the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Zhong Ming, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital Respiratory and Critical Medicine Director Cheng Zhengshun, Huanggang Central Hospital Deputy Director of Respiratory Medicine Huang Huxiang, in an attempt to further reveal the "inflammatory storm."
上述医师们表示，目前关于新冠肺炎中“炎症风暴”的机理及为何病程突变仍不清晰，但大多数死亡的患者中曾出现这一类似反应。
The doctors said the mechanism of the "inflammatory storm" in new crown pneumonia and why the disease mutated were unclear, but a similar response had been found in most patients who died.
_【对话】澎湃新闻：在治疗新冠肺炎患者时，你遇到过病人病情快速恶化的情况吗？钟鸣：有，之前相对稳定，很快病情加速，演变成多器官功能衰竭，许多死亡的病人经常会经历这样一个过程。
Q: Have you ever experienced a rapid deterioration in the treatment of patients with pneumonia? Bell-ringing: Yes, it was relatively stable before, and it quickly accelerated into multi-organ failure, a process that many dead patients often go through.
如果是面对这样的重症病人，我们之前的许多治疗经验都可能派不上用场，我相信很多医生都可能遇到了这样的情况。
Many of our previous treatment experiences might not have been useful in the face of such a severe case, and I am sure many doctors would have experienced it.
黄虎翔：是有2-3天病人突然恶化的情况，要不就是病毒潜伏在体内没有完全清除，因为病毒生长、繁殖速度非常快，可能一下子又爆发了。
Huanghuxiang: There are 2-3 days of sudden deterioration of the patient, or the virus has not been completely eliminated from the body, because the virus grows and multiplies very fast, and can break out again.
我们也碰到病人明明核酸检测转阴之后，复查变成阳性了，说明没清除干净。
We also encountered the patient when the nucleic acid test turned cloudy, the review turned positive, indicating that the clean.
也有在恢复期或隔离期，本来（病情）没什么，突然一下子加重的。
There is also a recovery or isolation period, the original (illness) nothing, suddenly aggravated.
但这样的病人还是少数，只是在住院时病人病情会有反复。
But such patients are still a minority, only in hospital patients will have repeated illness.
虽然任何疾病都会，但新冠病毒来得更凶险、更快。
Although any disease will, but the new crown virus more dangerous, faster.
澎湃新闻：有学者提出，这与一种称为“炎症风暴”的现象有关，你怎么看？钟鸣：在这些天的临床一线工作中，我发现有类似炎症风暴的现象，跟我在过去治疗其他疾病中遇到的炎症风暴的表现很像，但是现在还没有足够证据来证明具体的机制。
What do you think of the phenomenon called "inflammatory storms"? Bell-ringing: In my clinical frontline work these days, I find inflammatory storms similar to the ones I've had in the past to treat other diseases, but there's not enough evidence to support a specific mechanism.
目前的工作环境没法让我像以前那样去实验室做检查来证实我的想法，还是一种对以往经验的总结和猜测。
The current working environment does not allow me to go to the laboratory for the tests I used to do to confirm my ideas, or to summarize and speculate on past experience.
多数危重病人在最初发病后10天到2周，会出现这种临床表现。
This clinical manifestation occurs in most critically ill persons between 10 and 2 weeks after the initial onset of the disease.
程真顺：所谓的炎症风暴，在包含病毒性肺炎在内很多肺炎过程中都可能会发生。
Cheng Zhengshun: The so-called inflammatory storm may occur in the course of many pneumonia including viral pneumonia.
炎症风暴是指，病原菌在破坏我们的肺组织的时候，同时诱发我们体内的免疫反应，体内就会产生大量的炎性介质或细胞因子，本来的目的是想去对抗病原菌，但是这些炎性介质或细胞因子却可能会造成肺组织以及其他器官的损伤。
Inflammatory storms are those in which the pathogen destroys our lung tissue and elicits the immune response in the body, producing large amounts of inflammatory agents or cytokines, which are intended to fight pathogens, but which can cause damage to lung tissue and other organs.
对于有些病人，会导致弥漫性的肺的破坏，从而造成ARDS（急性呼吸窘迫综合征），呼吸衰竭，就有生命危险。
For some patients, it can lead to diffuse lung damage, resulting in ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), respiratory failure, life-threatening.
黄虎翔：早期比较平稳、后期凶险，是和炎症风暴有关，也叫细胞因子风暴，就是指任何一种感染（细菌、病毒、真菌等）会导致体内的炎症反应，如果炎症反应过强，会对其他正常组织产生损害，也会导致白肺。
Huang Huxiang: The early stage is more stable, the later dangerous, is related to the inflammation storm, also known as cytokine storm, that is, any kind of infection (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.) will cause inflammation in the body, if the inflammation too strong, will cause damage to other normal tissues, will also cause white lung.
最后造成全身炎症反应综合征，进一步可能导致多器官功能衰竭，最后脓毒症、休克，这是我们最害怕的。
Finally, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which may further lead to multiple organ failure, finally sepsis, shock, this is what we fear the most.
一般，病情加重会出现在第7-10天，如果疾病的进展2周之内没有危及到生命，痊愈的可能性还是比较大。
In general, the severity of the illness will occur in days 7-10, and the likelihood of recovery is high if the disease does not endanger life within 2 weeks.
在我们收治的患者中，重症和危重症的比例为20%。
Of the patients admitted to our hospital, 20 per cent are critically ill and critically ill.
澎湃新闻：在你的临床观察中，什么样的病人会出现这样的现象？钟鸣：我们接触的病人中，经历这种快速恶化的病人多数是年龄大的、有合并症的，尤其是高血压。
High surging news: What kind of patients do you see in your clinical observations? Bell-ringing: Most of the patients we came into contact with experienced this rapid deterioration were elderly, syndromic, especially hypertension.
程真顺：炎症风暴和免疫反应有一定关系。
Cheng Zhengshun: Inflammatory storm and immune response to a certain relationship.
理论上，免疫反应越强，越容易发生炎症风暴。
In theory, the stronger the immune response, the more likely inflammatory storms are to occur.
我自己接触的病例中有一个年纪较轻的患者，开始症状不明显，仅有轻微呼吸困难，在10天后，突然就出现呼吸窘迫，CT影上出现白肺。
One of the cases to which I was exposed was a younger patient with a mild onset of symptoms, only mild respiratory distress, sudden respiratory distress after 10 days, and a white lung on a CT image.
这个病例比较幸运，我们用了激素来抑制炎性介质风暴和有效无创呼吸机支持治疗，3天后病人的情况就稳定了，现在呼吸平稳，脱去了呼吸机。
Luckily, we used hormones to suppress inflammatory media storms and effective non-invasive ventilator support. After three days, the patient stabilized and now breathlessly breathless.
黄虎翔：一般是有基础疾病的，都是老年人。
Huanghuxiang: Generally there are basic diseases, are old people.
年轻人有，但很少见，出现这样情况大部分也能扛。
Young people do, but rarely do, and most of these situations can be carried out.
澎湃新闻：炎症风暴会出现在轻症病人身上吗？钟鸣：从轻症到重症，重症再到危重，都有可能快速发展。
Pound News: Can Inflammatory Storms Appear in Patients with Minor Disease? Bell-ringing: From mild to severe, from severe to critical, there is a possibility of rapid development.
程真顺：炎症风暴是导致呼吸衰竭，病情加重的主要原因，因此，临床上多见于重症患者。
Cheng Zhengshun: Inflammatory storm is the main cause that causes respiratory failure, the condition aggravates, therefore, sees in the serious patient clinically.
黄虎翔：很少，除非有的轻症病人肺部影像学显示病变很大，也会产生这样的炎症风暴。
Huang Huxiang: Very few, unless some light patient lung imaging shows very big pathological changes, also can produce such inflammation storm.
澎湃新闻：对于启动炎症风暴的病人，会采取什么样的治疗？钟鸣：目前工作中碰到的最大的困难就是我们还不知道为什么会出现刚才提到的病情突然恶化，因此也没有太好的针对性治疗，只能给予非特异性的生命和器官支持治疗。
Pound News: What kind of treatment will be given to patients who start inflammatory storms? Bell says: The biggest difficulty we face at work is that we don't know why the condition just mentioned suddenly deteriorates, so there is no good targeted treatment, only non-specific life and organ support treatment.
支持手段对一些病人有效，但是真正到那个阶段，即使用最强的支持手段，比如ECMO（俗称人工肺）、血液净化，这些过去对很多疾病都会有效的支持治疗方法，在这些病人身上效果都不一定好。
Support works for some patients, but at that stage, using the strongest support tools, such as ECMO, blood purification, which used to be effective in supporting treatments for many diseases, does not necessarily work well in these patients.
程真顺：所有肺损伤的病人，肺部必然有炎性介质反应，我们的身体会自我修复、平衡;如果炎症风暴造成器官损害非常严重，或有这个趋势，在临床上比较多用抑制炎性介质反应的药物如激素，减少对器官进一步的炎性介质打击，同时还需要器官功能支持治疗，如呼吸支持。
Cheng Zhengshun: All patients with lung injury, the lung must have inflammatory media reaction, our body will repair, balance; if inflammation storm caused organ damage is very serious, or there is a trend, more clinical use of anti-inflammatory media such as hormones, reduce further inflammatory media attacks on organs, and organ function support treatment, such as respiratory support.
黄虎翔：抗病毒没有特效药，主要是对症治疗，还有药物，营养支持等，帮病人渡过这个阶段，说不定就好了。
Huanghuxiang: There are no specific antiviral drugs, mainly symptomatic treatment, but also drugs, nutritional support, to help patients through this stage, perhaps better.
往往有些病人开始出现轻度缺氧或者较轻的呼吸衰竭，我们要及早启动呼吸支持，最常见的就是采用无创呼吸机和经鼻高流量给氧，这样就不会转变成很严重的呼吸衰竭，痊愈的几率就会增加。
Often some patients begin to experience mild hypoxia or mild respiratory failure. Early initiation of respiratory support, most commonly non-invasive breathing machines and high nasal flow, does not translate into severe respiratory failure and increases the chance of recovery.
澎湃新闻：发生炎症风暴的病人，死亡率是多少？钟鸣：进入这种阶段的危重病人死亡率，我并没有具体的统计数据。
Pound News: What's the fatality rate of patients with inflammatory storms? Bell-ringing: I don't have specific statistics on the fatality rate of critically ill patients entering this stage.
这个需要在一个整体发病的基数上计算才有意义。
This needs to be calculated on the basis of an overall incidence to make sense.
同时，对这一现象是否存在，或者是另有其他机制导致的这种临床表现还不清楚，所以无法明确定义这个现象，因此无法完成死亡率统计。
At the same time, it is not clear whether this phenomenon exists or whether it is the result of other mechanisms, which makes it impossible to define the phenomenon clearly and therefore to complete mortality statistics.
程真顺：炎症风暴不是死亡的唯一原因，但确实很多炎症风暴导致ARDS（急性呼吸窘迫综合征），是病情恶化并死亡的主要原因。
Cheng Zhengshun: Inflammatory storms are not the only cause of death, but it is true that many inflammatory storms cause ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and are the main cause of deterioration and death.
