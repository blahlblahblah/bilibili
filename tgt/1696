澎湃新闻记者 刘栋 实习生 刘宇锟岩田健太郎在24小时内获得过百万次的点击后，日本传染病专家岩田健太郎在20日清晨删除了他在社交媒体上发布的视频。
Japanese infectious-disease expert Kenshiro Iwata deleted his social media video in the early hours of the morning after Liu Dong intern Liu Yutong got a million hits in 24 hours.
“我认为由于没有必要进一步讨论，因此我删除了视频。
"I don't think there's any need for further discussion, so I deleted the video.
对于受到影响的人，我深表歉意，谢谢大家。
To those who have been affected, I apologize. Thank you.
”岩田健太郎在社交媒体上说道。
"Mr. Iwata said on social media.
18日晚，岩田通过社交网站披露了他当天登上“钻石公主”号邮轮后的见闻。
On the night of the 18th, Iwata revealed through social networking sites what he had seen when he boarded the "Princess Diamond" cruise.
在发布的视频中他严厉批评船上防疫管理松懈，官僚负责一切，缺少专家，导致病毒“无处不在”，并坦承自己作为资深的防疫专家，也“非常害怕”被感染。
In the video he released, he harshly criticized lax epidemic prevention on board, bureaucrats in charge of everything and a shortage of experts, leading to the "ubiquity" of the virus and admitting that he was "very scared" of infection as a senior anti-epidemic specialist.
视频发布后，在日本国内引发了极大的关注。
After the release of the video, in Japan caused a great deal of attention.
日本政府、在野党和民众纷纷发表了不同的看法。
Different views have been expressed by the Japanese government, opposition parties and the public.
“政府在长达两周内没有公开任何关于邮轮内部的信息，使得人们根本无从得知邮轮上发生了什么。
"For two weeks the government did not disclose any information about the contents of the cruise ship, making it impossible to know what happened on the ship."
”岩田健太郎在19日晚回复澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）的采访时说道。
"Iwata replied in an interview on the evening of the 19th to the roaring news (www.thepaper.cn).
次日清晨，他删除了自己的视频，表示不方便接受进一步的采访。
Early the next morning, he deleted his video, saying it was inconvenient for him to be interviewed further.
19日，日本政府已启动邮轮上的游客下船程序。
On the 19th, the Japanese government has initiated procedures for the disembarkation of tourists from cruise ships.
首批500名乘客当天下船。
The first 500 passengers disembarked the same day.
同一天，邮轮上再新增新冠病毒感染者79人，累计确诊人数达621人。
On the same day, 79 people were newly infected with the virus and a total of 621 people were diagnosed.
20日，日本政府消息人士透露，2名被确诊感染新冠肺炎的“钻石公主”号邮轮乘客死亡。
Two passengers aboard the MV Princess Diamond were found dead after being diagnosed with pneumonia, a Japanese government source said Tuesday.
同日，将有更多的乘客下船，踏上回家之路。
More passengers will disembark on the same day on their way home.
当事官员：岩田因不能胜任工作被赶下船19日晚，日本厚生劳动省官员高山义浩在社交媒体上发表了长文，承认自己就是最初帮助岩田医生上船的官员，并对岩田在视频中提出的诸多问题做出了回应。
Officials involved: Iwada was thrown out of the boat late Thursday night because he was unfit for work. Takahiro Ko, an official of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, made a long statement on social media, admitting that he was the first official to help Dr. Iwata board and responding to many of the questions raised in the video.
“对于不认识岩田老师的人来说，他的表述或许太强烈了。
"For someone who doesn't know Mr. Iwata, his words may be too strong.
这些内容可能会对乘客和在现场努力的工作人员们造成负面影响。
Such content could have a negative impact on passengers and staff working on the ground.
所以在承认事实的同时，作为视频中涉及的当事人，请允许我澄清被误解和遗漏的内容。
So while acknowledging the facts, as the party involved in the video, allow me to clarify what was misunderstood and omitted.
”他说道。
'he said.
对于岩田上船过程的“艰辛”，最后只能以日本灾难医疗响应小组（DMAT ）的成员而非传染病专家的身份上船。
The "hardships" of getting on board the ship were ultimately limited to members of the Japan Disaster Medical Response Team (DMAT), not infectious disease experts.
高山解释称，是因为现场正在进行乘客下船的相关操作，在这种情形下，如果突然有专家指导，害怕岩田先生会被“敬而远之”，也影响下船行动的继续。
Ko explained that because the scene was carrying out passenger disembarkation-related operations, in which case, if there were sudden expert guidance, it was feared that Mr. Iwata would be "avoided," which would also affect the continuation of the disembarkation.
高山表示，事实上，岩田只在船上待了2个小时就被赶下了船。
In fact, he said, Iwanda was driven off the ship after only two hours on board.
他主要看到的地方是在大厅周围的区域。
The main place he saw was in the area around the hall.
“我认为邮轮是个比较特殊的空间，并不是环视一下就能给出意见的。
"I think the cruise is a special space and I don't have to look around to give advice.
”他说道。
'he said.
岩田健太郎在视频中称现场十分“混乱”，船上没有区分未被感染的“绿区”（安全区）和可能被病毒污染的“红区”（危险区）。
In the video, Mr. Iwata described the scene as "chaotic," with no distinction made between uninfected "green areas" (safe areas) and "red zones" (dangerous areas) that could be contaminated by viruses.
他描述称，“发烧的人从自己的房间出来步行去医务室”，“人们穿着个人防护装备到处走来走去，在同一个地方吃饭，甚至吃饭的时候还戴着防护手套。
"People with a fever come out of their rooms and walk to the infirmary," he said. "People walk around in personal protective gear, eat in the same place, and even wear protective gloves while eating.
”对此，高山回应称，“作为一个传染病医生，（岩田把现场）形容为混乱，这点我可以理解。
In response, Alpine responded, "As an infectious disease doctor, [Iwata described the scene] described as chaotic, and I understand that.
但是他的表达方式会让人们产生误解，觉得现场完全没有分区。
But his way of expressing himself can lead people to misunderstand that there is no partition at all.
但事实上现场严格执行了分区。
In fact, zoning was strictly enforced.
尽管可能不完美。
Not perfect though it may be.
”而对于走动的人员，高山认为不是病人而是部分乘客。
For those who walked, the mountain did not think of them as patients but as part of the passengers.
“即使是乘客，我认为这种情况也很少见。
"Even for passengers, I don't think it's very common.
”他说。
'he said.
“的确，如果是在发达国家的医院，或者是发展中国家或国际组织建立的医疗中心，会实施更为复杂的感染控制。
"Indeed, more complex infection control is practised in hospitals in developed countries, or in medical centres established by developing countries or international organizations."
但是突然之间，在一艘有大约3700人的船上(而且有很多老年人)……隔离任务是极其复杂的。
But all of a sudden, in a ship with about 3,700 people (and a lot of old people)... the task of segregation is extremely complex.
”他解释道。
'he explained.
岩田还在视频中表示，“20多年的防疫工作经历中，我从未感到自己的感染风险如此之大。
"I've never felt so high a risk of infection in more than 20 years of immunization work," Iwata said in the video.
即使在非洲抗击埃博拉病毒与在北京抗击SARS（非典型肺炎）时，也没有那么令人恐惧。
Even when fighting Ebola in Africa is less frightening than fighting SARS in Beijing.
”对此，高山表示，“这是岩田老师敏感性的问题，所以我不会否认。
"This is a sensitive issue for Mr. Iwata, so I won't deny it," Ko said.
在船只这样的特殊封闭空间里发生了传染病，你不可能不害怕。
You can't be unafraid of an infectious disease occurring in a special confined space like a ship.
但是，我希望你们能够理解，有些人正在继续努力。
But I hope you will understand that some are continuing their efforts.
”“虽然有很多挑战，但是我们已经有了一点点的进步，当然还有改进的空间。
"" There are many challenges, but we have made a little progress and there is certainly room for improvement.
至少在所有行动完成之前，我们不能让乘客上岸。
At least until all operations are completed, we can't disembark the passengers.
他说道。
'he said.
对于岩田称自己给出的建议未被采纳，反而让一些官员不高兴，最终赶他下船的抱怨。
Mr Iwata said his advice was not heeded, but upset some officials and eventually drove him off the ship.
高山回应称，“船上除了DMAT，还有厚生劳动省、自卫队、以及最重要的以船长为首的邮轮方，所以有很多决策流程要走。
Alpine responded, "In addition to the DMAT, there are the Ministry of Health, Labour, Self-Defense Forces and, most importantly, the ship's captain, so there are many decision-making processes to follow.
（岩田先生）没有理解其中复杂性，违背了我们的约定。
(Mr. Iwata) did not understand the complexities involved and reneged on our agreement.
至少他给我打个电话沟通一下就好了，但是他直接就从各方面给出感染防控的意见。
At least he'd give me a call to communicate, but he'd give me direct advice on all aspects of infection control.
”“因为他不能胜任工作，所以被迫下船。
"" Because he wasn't up to the job, he was forced to disembark.
当然，作为一名传染病医生，岩田先生的建议大体上是合理的。
Of course, as an infectious-diseases physician, Mr. Iwata's advice is largely sound.
但是如果我们只顾提出正确意见的话，组织有可能就无法运转。
But if we focus on making the right arguments, the organization may not work.
特别是在危机管理中，获得信任比什么都重要。
Especially in crisis management, gaining trust is more important than anything else.
”高山还进一步表示，“批评是可以的，但是我希望能够避免在无法解决问题的情况下制造恐慌……传染病医生需要有作为顾问的能力。
"Criticism is OK, but I hope to avoid creating panic in the absence of a solution... infectious disease doctors need the ability to act as advisers," Ko added.
这也是一种让人愿意倾听的能力。
It is also the ability to be willing to listen.
当别人没有听我的时候，我不认为是对方的错。
When people don't listen to me, I don't think it's their fault.
而是我解释的方式很糟糕。
It's the way I explain it.
”日本政府和专家各执一词对于岩田的视频，日本政府19日也作出了回应。
The Japanese government and experts agreed on the video of Iwada, Japan's government on the 19th also responded.
据日本《每日新闻》报道，日本内阁官房长官菅义伟在当天的记者会上回应称，日本政府采取了一切措施防止疫情扩大，并表示会虚心倾听社会上各式各样的批评意见。
Japan's top cabinet secretary, Naoto Kan, responded at a news conference that the government had taken all measures to prevent the disease from spreading, and said he would listen to all kinds of criticism from society with an open mind, the Daily News reported.
对于“安全区和危险区难以区分”的批评，菅义伟在记者会上称“无法用是或否来回答”。
Mr Kan told a press conference that "there is no way to answer yes or no" to the criticism that "safe areas and dangerous areas are difficult to distinguish."
关于防止传染的措施，他表示已确保每一位船员佩戴口罩、洗手并进行酒精消毒。
With regard to measures to prevent infection, he said that he had ensured that every crew member wore a mask, washed his hands and disinfected with alcohol.
如果船员被确诊感染，同一个房间的船员也将必须隔离以防止疫情扩大。
If the crew is diagnosed with an infection, the crew in the same room will have to be quarantined to prevent the outbreak from spreading.
《朝日新闻》援引一位日本厚生劳动省官员的话表示，岩田视频中的“船上没有传染病专家，全靠外行人来进行防治传染”这一指控不符合事实，船上有对传染病十分了解的医生和护士，船上的防疫工作也接受传染病学会的指导。
The Asahi Shimbun quoted a Japanese ministry official as saying that the allegation in the video that there were "no infectious disease experts on board, relying solely on lay people to prevent and treat infections," said the Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted a Japanese ministry official as saying.
不过曾经登船的日本环境感染学会成员、岩手医科大学教授樱井滋19日在接受采访时承认，并没有专家长时间待在船上。
But Sakurai, a former member of the Japan Society for Environmental Infection and a professor at Iwama Medical University, admitted in an interview on Tuesday that no expert had been on board for long periods.
对于“钻石公主”号邮轮上发生的新型冠状病毒肺炎集体感染现象，日本国立感染症研究所19日首次公布了一份分析结果，称很多乘客的感染是在隔离措施采取之前就已发生。
Japan's National Institute of Infection (NII) released its first analysis of a new case of coronavirus pneumonia on board the MV Princess Diamond, saying many of the passengers' infections occurred before the quarantine measures.
感染可能是通过船上举行的活动扩散的。
The infection may have spread through activities carried out on board ships.
同时，报告指出在10日以后船员出现感染的情况增多，研究认为是由于部分船员继续在从事维持邮轮运行的必需工作，导致隔离不彻底。
At the same time, the report noted an increase in the incidence of infection among crew members after 10 days, which the study attributed to incomplete isolation as part of the crew continued to carry out essential work to maintain the operation of the cruise ship.
樱井滋教授进一步指出，“船上的传染存在两个波峰……推测最初是通过参加派对及自助餐的乘客之间进行传播，之后通过船员提供服务而扩散”。
"There are two peaks in the ship's infection... presumably first spread among passengers attending parties and buffets and then spread through the services of crews," Sakurai added.
然而专家中也有意见认为，由于这份报告病例数有限，而且也有人目前没有症状但可能今后会发病，因此“无法断定游客被隔离在房间后的感染减少”。
However, the view was also expressed among the experts that, because of the limited number of reported cases and the fact that there are currently no symptoms but may develop in the future, "it is not possible to conclude that there is a decrease in infections when tourists are isolated in their rooms."
