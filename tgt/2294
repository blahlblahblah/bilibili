👆本号引起极度舒适，建议星标一下在疫情爆发之时，市场技术与效率优势填补了行政力量难以触达的盲点，行政力量随后成为了大局指挥的关键要素。
Comfort caused by this number, the proposed star signs in the outbreak of the outbreak, market technology and efficiency advantages to fill the administrative forces hard to reach blind spots, the executive power has become a key element of overall command.
但在新的阶段，当市场中各类经济体本身有了更多的常态化需求时，行政力量帮扶政策与一刀切式的掣肘却形成了一对矛盾。
But in the new phase, when there is more demand for normalisation among the various economies in the market, there is a contradiction between administrative-power-support policies and one-size-fits-all constraints.
在多轮自上而下动员、自下而上的权衡后，复工的节奏关乎某种平衡。
After several rounds of top-down mobilization and bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of returning to work is a matter of balance.
作者 | 刘浩川编辑 | 周亚波设计 | 范晓雯从关注抗疫的局面，到凝视疫情中的“人”与疫情期间的生活，再到聚焦疫情冲击之下各行各业的“受灾状况”以及“全面复工”，在抗疫情时期的中国舆论场，核心议题的扩充不仅仅丰富了讨论的维度，也扩大了舆情影响的阈值。
From keeping an eye on the epidemic, to staring at people and life during the epidemic, to focusing on the "disaster situation" and "getting back to work," the expansion of the core agenda has not only enriched the dimensions of the discussion, but also broadened the threshold of public opinion in an epidemic-resistant China.
《三声》（微信公众号ID：tosansheng）曾于《抗疫时期的中国舆论场③》中记录到，当疫情关注的焦点从关注抗疫局面本身到关注疫情中“我”的生活时，意味着“疫情对每一个舆论参与者的切身影响正在显著上升”，“这件事已经是每一个人的事”。
"Three voices" (ID: tosansheng) recorded in "China's Public Opinion Fields in the Epidemic Period," when the focus of the epidemic moved from concern about the epidemic itself to the focus on the lives of "me" in the epidemic, meant that "the epidemic's immediate impact on everyone involved is rising dramatically" and that "it is everyone's business."
如今，转变再度发生。
Today, the shift is happening again.
舆论场对疫情冲击之下各经济体现状的讨论继续成为增量。
Public-opinion discussion of the current state of economies under the impact of the epidemic continues to grow.
讨论不论聚焦于微观上的个人生活，还是国家的宏观经济脉络，都导向着“所有人都在成为疫情亲历者”的社会情感的进一步增强。
Whether the discussion focuses on individual lives at the micro level or on the country's macroeconomic context, it leads to a further strengthening of the social sentiment that "everyone is becoming a witness to the epidemic."
与此相伴，随着复工期的到来，“特殊时期”的讨论场景也正在客观上由“长假生活”转移到相对偏常态的日常工作。
Accompanied by this, with the restoration period, the "special period" discussion scene is also objectively transferred from the "long vacation life" to the relatively normal daily work.
疫情进程深入，影响不断深化、立体，讨论语境也从“紧急时刻”逐步过度到在一定时间内不得不接受的“新常态”。
As the epidemic progresses in depth, the impact is deepening and three-dimensional, and the context of the discussion is gradually changing from the "emergency moment" to the "new normal" that has to be accepted at a certain time.
伴随这一过程的，是商业力量这一主体在不同时期所扮演的舆论场景角色的变化：抗疫初期，疫情局面瞬息万变，不同企业抗击疫情的措施被重点关注。
Accompanying this process is the changing role of commercial forces as the main body of public opinion in different periods: in the early stage of the epidemic, the epidemic situation changed rapidly, and the measures taken by different enterprises to combat the epidemic were focused on.
商业力量是应对疫情局面的诸多社会力量中的一环。
Commercial power is one of the many social forces responding to the epidemic.
度过极速的信息发布期，报道的视角开始凝视疫情中受影响的不同个体。
After a period of intense information dissemination, the perspective of the report begins to gaze at the different individuals affected by the outbreak.
这种个体“自然人”过渡到了“企业个体”。
This individual "natural person" has made the transition to "individual enterprise."
此时，因为疫情而经营状况大受影响，现金流吃紧的一众中小企业成为舆论生态的主角。
At this time, because of the epidemic and operating conditions greatly affected, cash flow tight a number of small and medium-sized enterprises have become the protagonist of public opinion ecology.
企业在舆论中被重点关注的角色，从抗击疫情的奉献者变为疫情中的受害者。
The role of business in public opinion has been focused on, from fighting the devotees of the epidemic to becoming victims of the epidemic.
而伴随复工期的到来与舆论的发酵，呼吁减少一刀切防疫管制，促进企业复工的声量不断提高。
With the arrival of the resumption period and the fermentation of public opinion, calling for a reduction in one-size-fits-all epidemic control, promote the sound of enterprises back to work.
人们对企业的关注点，回归到企业何时能承担起本来的角色。
The focus is on when the company will return to its original role.
百年之前，李普曼曾于舆论学的经典《大众舆论》中写到，现代社会如此庞大复杂，以至于我们只能依托于我们脑海中由各类信息编织而成的我们对世界的认知图景（拟态环境）展开行动。
One hundred years ago, Lipman wrote in his classic opinion piece, "Public Opinion," that modern society is so vast and complex that we can only act on the cognitive picture of the world (mimicry) that we weave in our minds from a variety of information.
大众脑海中对世界认知图景的集合，便形成了舆论。
Public opinion is formed when the public mind gathers views of the world.
舆论场与现实，从来在相互构建，相互影响。
The public opinion field and the reality, have always been in the mutual construction, the mutual influence.
百年之后，情况依然如此。
One hundred years later, that remains the case.
舆论场中商业力量的形象不断变化，同时，商业力量的面貌不断被形塑的过程中，现实与舆论场绞合而成的巨大张力推动我们每个人从一个由疫情占据的当下，逐步走向受疫情影响的未来。
The image of commercial power in the media is constantly changing, while the face of commercial power is constantly being shaped, and the enormous tension between reality and public opinion is pushing each of us from an epidemic-dominated present to an epidemic-affected future.
01 | 动员与响应1月20日是较多舆论总结的全民抗疫认知原点。
Mobilization and response January 20 was a major public awareness rallying point for the epidemic.
在社会认知上是钟南山的公开讲话，而在行政认知上，则是当日最高领导人对新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情作出重要指示。
The social cognition is Zhong Nan Shan's public speech, but in the administrative cognition, is the day the top leaders of the new coronavirus infection pneumonia made important instructions.
两条线均发布自主流媒体，“抗疫”成为面向社会各个主体发布的社会动员。
Both lines released their own media, "anti-epidemic" has become a social mobilization issued to all the main social mobilization.
1月23日，武汉封城。
Wuhan Sealed on January 23.
武汉市生活与抗疫物资不断告急。
Wuhan city life and anti-epidemic materials are constantly in crisis.
驰援武汉成为抗疫工作的中心任务。
The rescue of Wuhan has become the central task of anti-epidemic work.
面对仍不明朗的疫情发展趋势，也已有媒体撰文分析抗疫局面下互联网企业所面临的任务与挑战，并总结企业的应对措施。
In the face of the still unclear epidemic trend, the media has written to analyze the challenges faced by Internet enterprises in the epidemic situation, and to summarize the enterprises' countermeasures.
1月22日，燃财经公众号发表文章：《互联网迎战新型肺炎》。
On January 22, the Financial and Economic Journal published an article titled "The Internet versus the New Pneumonia."
文章总结到，在医疗物资供应领域，口罩供应紧张，价格上涨，并总结了电商平台、与上游医疗企业所发布的不允许涨价同时宣布加大生产力度的公告。
The article concluded that in the supply of medical supplies, supply of masks was tight, prices rose, and announcements were made that electricity business platforms, together with upstream medical companies, would not allow price increases while announcing increased production.
在旅游业方面，面对交通、住宿等领域的大量退订退单情况，携程、飞猪、同程艺龙等几乎所有差旅平台业发布了退改保障措施公告。
In the tourism industry, in the face of a large number of traffic, accommodation and other areas of refund, Ctrip, Pig, the same trip arts dragon and almost all travel platform industry issued a notice of safeguard measures.
1月23日，三声也发表报道《「封城」前后的商业总动员》，以武汉封城为中心节点，分析封城前后商家所发布的相关保障措施。
On January 23, the three voices also published a report on "Business Mobilization Before and After the Closure of the City," taking Wuhan Sealing as the central node and analyzing the relevant safeguard measures issued by businesses before and after the closure of the city.
除了盘点了封城前电商、差旅平台发布的口罩禁止涨价加大口罩供应以及优惠退改票的保障措施之外，三声还记录到封城后各企业为保障武汉市日常生活供应所做的努力，如针对武汉市生活物资短缺的情况，武汉盒马发布公告，将全力保障不打烊、不涨价。
In addition to an inventory of the pre-city electricity business, travel platform issued by the respirator ban on price increases increase the supply of face masks and preferential refund guarantee measures, the three also recorded enterprises after the closure of the city to guarantee the supply of daily life in Wuhan, such as Wuhan issued a notice, will not closed, do not increase prices.
但是在封城前后的舆论场中，对企业举动的报道与盘点仍然较少。
But before and after the closure of the public opinion field, the enterprise's behavior is still less reported and inventory.
对于大多数媒体而言，此时的报道重点仍聚焦于瞬息万变的疫情发展形式上。
For most media, the focus is still on the rapidly changing form of the epidemic.
同时，大多数企业的抗疫举措仍然以声明为主，具体措施处于起步阶段。
At the same time, the majority of enterprises' anti-epidemic initiatives remain declarative, with specific measures in their infancy.
1月29日，经济观察报发表报道《“悬空”的武汉，一场企业抗疫的接力赛正在进行》，以实地采访的形式带回了企业抗疫的实况：文章采访了德邦快递管理层员工闫东方。
On January 29, the Economic Observer published "Suspended" Wuhan, an enterprise anti-epidemic relay race is underway, "in the form of a field interview to bring back the reality of the epidemic: the article interviewed Debang express management staff Yan Eastern.
在董事长崔卫星的牵头下，德邦物流在封城后第一时间组织起47人应急小组，利用公司自有货车资源为封城的武汉运送救灾物资。
Under the leadership of Chairman Cui Satellite, Debang logistics in the first time after the closure of the organization of a 47-member emergency team, using the company's own truck resources for the closure of Wuhan to transport relief supplies.
文中还报道到，1月25日，菜鸟网络联合中通、德邦、AirCity等海内外物流企业，开通国内及全球绿色通道，免费从海内外各地为武汉地区运输社会捐赠的救援物资。
On January 25, the rookie network joined forces with domestic and foreign logistics companies such as China Tong, Germany and AirCity to open domestic and global green channels to transport free relief materials from home and abroad to Wuhan.
1月27日，三架顺丰专机为武汉运来进70吨救灾物资。
On January 27, three Shunfeng planes brought in 70 tons of relief materials for Wuhan.
同时，本文还就企业高效运送医疗物资这一现象提出一个重要观点，“在武汉，企业这一组织正在在政府的调配下，填补行政权力难以触达之处，承担起一部份疫情应对的职责。
At the same time, this paper also raises an important point about the phenomenon of efficient transportation of medical materials by enterprises. "In Wuhan, the organization is under the control of the government to fill the administrative power difficult to reach, to assume a part of the responsibility for the epidemic.
与行政体系相较，这些企业总体更加灵活、高效，并拥有更专业的装备设备和技术储备。
These enterprises are generally more flexible and efficient than the administrative system and have more specialized equipment and technical reserves.
”与这一观点交叉印证的一个核心舆论热点是全民对武汉医疗物资紧缺的关注。
A central issue of public opinion that crosses from this point of view is the public's concern about the scarcity of medical supplies in Wuhan.
至1月23日，武昌医院、华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院等多家医院于互联网上发布医疗资源告急的求助书，向社会请求捐助护目镜、N95口罩等防护用品。
By January 23, many hospitals, including Wuchang Hospital and Tongji Medical College Affiliated Concorde Hospital of Tongji Medical School of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, posted on the Internet urgent requests for medical resources and requested donations of protective equipment such as goggles and N95 masks.
于互联网上引起广泛讨论。
has been widely discussed on the Internet.
1月30日，「每日人物」公众号所发调查报道《那些储备的医用物资都去了哪儿》近一步的论述了医疗物资供应难题的症结：供应层面，在既有的医疗物资供应体系层层报批效率较低：如果出现应急响应，施工单位需要口罩，先联系政府，政府应急办的工作人员联系卫健委，卫健委再经由专门科室由供应商层层传达到工厂。
On January 30, the Daily People survey reported that "Where are all the medical supplies stored?" took a closer look at the crux of the medical supply problem: on the supply side, construction units need masks in case of emergency response.
工厂生产完毕由卫健委相关科室开车拖走联系后续运输。
Factory production by the relevant departments of health care drag-and-drop contact follow-up transport.
如果跨省调用资源则有国家统一部署。
If resources are transferred across provinces, countries are deployed uniformly.
而导致的结果则是武汉疫情的巨大物资缺口，严重考验了行政速度。
The result was a huge material gap in Wuhan, which severely tested the administrative speed.
官方物资难以及时运达。
Official supplies are difficult to arrive in time.
“而互联网信息交换速度之快、调用资源能力之强，叠加公民的参与热情及行动力，也许会比行政速度跑得更快。
"But the speed of Internet information exchange, the ability to mobilize resources, superimposing citizens' enthusiasm for participation and action, may be faster than administrative speed."
”同时，运输层面，无论是官方救援物资还是海内外的社会捐助物资也都面临运力不足的问题1月25日，三联生活周刊于调查文章《武汉医疗物资之困：我们能做什么？》中报道到，武汉普仁医院一位医生向记者反应，自从求救信息发出后，医院其实接到了许多物资捐助的电话。
At the same time, the transport sector, whether official relief goods or donations from the public at home and abroad, also faces a shortage of transportation capacity.
然而，这其中大多数的电话却并不能转化为有效的救助，原因是“物资进不来”。
Most of these calls, however, do not translate into effective relief because "supplies do not get in."
结合当时舆论场呈现的信息，一方面，微博、微信等社区搭建的基础信息分享平台，成功扮演着社会捐助物资的聚拢者的角色；另一方面，阿里京东等电商平台整合医疗生产资源加紧生产，并组织物流力量进行配送等一系列抓手，在当时的环境里体现了十分重要的价值。
On the one hand, the basic information-sharing platform set up by micro-blogging and micro-letter communities has successfully played the role of the converger of social donation materials. On the other hand, Arijingdong and other electronic commerce platforms consolidated the medical production resources to step up production and organize logistics forces to distribute.
除了物资运输方面之外，从媒体的实时报道中我们也发现：商业力量也在社会动员的其他环节持续发挥作用，与行政力量配合发力，弥补行政力量的空缺。
In addition to the transport of goods, real-time media coverage reveals that commercial forces also continue to play a role in other aspects of social mobilization, working hand in hand with the executive to fill the gaps in the executive power.
经济观察报报道，1月24日，滴滴成立了一支100位司机组成的“医疗保障队”，对接武汉3家医院，为封城期间因公共交通工具停运而出行有困难的医护人员提供服务。
On January 24, the Economic Observer reported, drip-drip set up a "medical security team" of 100 drivers to dock three hospitals in Wuhan to provide services to medical staff who had difficulty travelling during the city's closure because of public transport.
1月25日，新京报、南都周刊等媒体纷纷报道武汉酒店业陆续自发组织邀请医护人员免费就近入住，逾235家武汉酒店免费接待医护工作者。
On January 25, the new Beijing News, Nandu Weekly and other media reported that Wuhan hotel industry has spontaneously invited medical personnel to live near free of charge, more than 235 Wuhan hotels free of charge to receive medical workers.
而在1月末2月初引发举国关注的湖北红十字会事件中，在被几乎所有媒体曝光捐增物资于红十字会仓库中大批积压却难以分发到医院手中之后，1月31日，九州通医药物流公司正式协助武汉红十字会分装物资。
In the case of the Hubei Red Cross, which sparked national concern in late January and early February, Kyushu Medical Logistics formally assisted the Wuhan Red Cross in reloading on 31 January, after a huge backlog of donations in Red Cross warehouses that had been exposed by almost all media outlets was difficult to distribute to hospitals.
在凤凰新闻的现场报道中提到，九州通一位工作人员称紧急的医疗物资在2小时内即能完成到货到分配的过程。
A Kyushu staff member said emergency medical supplies could be delivered to distribution within two hours, according to a Phoenix News live report.
同时，2月3日，南方周末也对九州通入驻后的物资分配情况做了跟进报道：《“外援”协助武汉红十字会后：理货效率提高，调配要听指令》。
Meanwhile, on February 3, Southern Weekend also made a follow-up report on the distribution of materials after the arrival of Kyushu: "Foreign Aid" to help Wuhan Red Cross Society: improve efficiency of handling goods, deployment should follow the instructions.
经过事实与舆论场的双重发酵，企业在救灾中的技术与效率优势也逐渐得到官方的肯定与回应：2月10日新闻发布会上，民政部基层政权建设和社区治理司司长陈越良呼吁阿里腾讯等大型网络公司为社区防疫工作者开发社区公共软件，提供给社区工作者使用。
After a double fermentation of facts and public opinion, the technological and efficiency advantages of enterprises in disaster relief were gradually recognized and responded to by officials: At a press conference on 10 February, Chen Yuliang, Director of the Department of Grassroots Power-Building and Community Governance of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, called on large Internet companies such as Alitensen to develop community public software for community cordon workers to use.
并表示“一个有益的公益软件比捐10个亿还管用。
A useful public-interest software donation would help more than a billion dollars.
”随后阿里与腾讯分布于微博进行了回应，表示已准备好阿里云回应到：阿里云联合支付宝、钉钉推出免费的智能社区疫情防控小程序，可以帮助社区一线工作人员完成出入登记、健康打卡、疫情通知等工作。
Ali and Tencent distributed in a Weibo response, saying Ali Yun was ready to respond: Aliyun paid treasure, nailing out free small procedures for intelligent community disease prevention and control, which could help front-line community workers with access registration, health cards, notification of outbreaks, etc.
腾讯回应：社区疫情管理工具已准备好。
Tencent response: Community-based disease management tools are ready.
2月8日腾讯海纳社区电子出入证已上线，全体居民申报健康信息，实现政府部门分级查看疫情数据。
Tencent Hena Community Electronic Pass went online on February 8, all residents declare health information, the realization of government departments to view epidemic data.
02 | 扶持与自救时间来到1月末，伴随着媒体报道视角的深入与抗疫工作的逐步展开，舆论场呈现的重点从对局面的聚焦来到对疫情中“人”的关切。
Support and self-help came at the end of January, as media coverage deepened and the fight against the epidemic unfolded, the focus of public opinion shifted from a focus on the situation to a concern for "people" in the epidemic.
在对诸多受疫情影响的主体的探访报道中，众多小微企业的命运逐渐引发人们的关注。
The fate of many micro and small enterprises has attracted more and more attention in the visiting reports of many subjects affected by the epidemic.
整个商业界在疫情期间于大众认知中所扮演的角色，也逐渐由抗疫工作的参与者转变为疫情风险的承担者。
The role of the business community as a whole in public perception during the epidemic has also gradually shifted from being a participant in the fight against the epidemic to being the bearer of the epidemic's risks.
首先被关注到的是旅游业、餐饮业这两个损失了大批春节期间客流的服务行业：1月31日，经济观察报文章《疫情中受创行业里的他们：复工无期 月亏房租十几万 期盼扶持政策》报导了作为导游的边丽夫妇和在朝阳区经营烧烤店的“腰子哥”所面临的困境。
The first is the tourism and catering industries, two service industries that lost a large number of passengers during the Spring Festival: January 31, the Economic Observer's article They in the Trained Industry of the Epidemic: Back to Work Monthly Deficit Rent Deficit of Hundreds of thousands of Expected Enabling Policies reported the plight of the wenlii couple as tour guides and the "kidneys" running barbecues in Chaoyang district.
类似的，燃财经《自救与救他，一家餐饮企业的生死240小时》，财新网《疫情下的餐饮业：租金人工成本难压缩 现金流高度紧张》都将餐饮业当作疫情影响所冲击的典型行业样本进行分析。
Similarly, Flaming Finance, "Save and Save him, 240 Hours of a Restaurant," Caixin Caixin's Restaurant Industry: Rent Labor Costs Difficult to Compress Cash Flow, both analyze the catering industry as a typical sample of industries hit by the epidemic's impact.
2月1日，大型连锁餐饮企业西北莜面村董事长贾国龙在接受投中网采访时表示“疫情致2万多员工待业，贷款发工资也撑不过3个月”。
On February 1, large restaurant chain Northwest naked oats village chairman Jia Guolong said in an interview on the net: "The epidemic caused more than 20,000 employees to be unemployed, loans to pay wages will not last three months."
“西北莜面村现金流业无法支撑三个月”。
"Northwest naked face village cash flow industry can not support three months."
大型餐饮企业西北莜面村针对自身危机进行的“自曝”进一步引发了社会对餐饮业危机的强烈关注。
The "self exposure" of naked oats village in northwest of large catering enterprises in response to its own crisis further aroused the strong attention of the society to the catering industry crisis.
在行业领域上，经过几天的舆论发酵，聚焦的行业进一步拓展：经济观察报2月4日的报道《母婴店歇业引发的产业链考验：做好了熬半年的准备》以母婴行业为切入视角，描绘了许多制造业一整个产业链所面临的窘境：“零售门店供应商一边正在面临终端不活跃带来的回款停滞、一边是货款压在品牌方处却拿不到货，只能消耗库存的压力；品牌方们则扛起了新货生产不出来、旧货又流通不起来，但是成本消耗一天都不少的重负。
In the industry, after days of fermenting public opinion, the focus industry has expanded further: The Economic Observer's February 4 report, "Testing the industrial chain as a result of the closure of mother and child stores: getting ready for half a year" portrays many manufacturing and industrial chains struggling with stagnant payouts from sluggish end-of-life sales.
”同时，在创投领域，朱啸虎、王冉、吴世春等投资人对创投者与机构给出了几乎相同的建议：“严控成本、开源节流，死卡现金流”。
Meanwhile, in the field of venture capital, investors such as Zhu Xiaoxu, Wang Ran and Wu Shichun have come up with almost the same advice to venture capitalists and institutions: "Tighten costs, cut corners and cash flow from deadlocks."
究其原因，一方面，投资活动受疫情影响，收入锐减。
On the one hand, investment activity was affected by the epidemic and income fell sharply.
如投资人王冉在演讲《王冉：当前疫情对上半年创业企业融资的影响》所给出的结论，“所有原本计划节后启动的融资，由于疫情的原因真正能够对外启动很可能要到3月，交易完成几乎肯定要到下半年”。
As investors Wang Ran in the speech "Wang Ran: the impact of the current epidemic on the financing of startups in the first half of the year," all originally planned post-festival financing is likely to be launched in March and almost certainly in the second half of the year due to the outbreak. "
同时，由于停工、交通管制等因素，新业务难以展开，收入业受很大影响。
At the same time, due to work stoppage, traffic control and other factors, new business is difficult to start, income industry is greatly affected.
1月31日，恒大研究院任泽平发布研究报告《疫情对中国经济的影响分析与政策建议》从宏观角度系统梳理了疫情对于行业以及经济宏观形势的冲击：报告中他分析到，中观行业上，疫情对餐饮、旅游、电影、交运、教育培训等行业冲击最大，医药医疗、在线游戏等行业受益。
On January 31, Ren Zeping of the Institute of Research of the University of Heng released his research report Analysis and Policy Recommendations on the Impact of the Epidemic on China's Economy. From a macro perspective, he analyzed the impact of the epidemic on industries such as catering, tourism, film, delivery, education and training.
而对微观个体的影响上“生产和营业停摆，收入和现金流中断，但是房租、工资、利息等费用刚性支付，企业将蒙受巨大损失。
And the impact on micro-individuals "production and business stoppage, income and cash flow disruption, but rent, wages, interest and other expenses rigid payment, enterprises will suffer huge losses.
经营中断可能导致订单合同违约、资金周转困难，部分体量较小、抗风险能力较弱的中小微企业将面临破产倒闭的困境，风险还可能沿着供应链和担保链上下及横向传导，引发局部性危机”。
Business interruption could lead to contract defaults, liquidity difficulties, insolvency for some of the smaller, less risk-resistant MSMEs, and local crises along and across supply chains and collateral chains. "
同时，针对中小企业经营状况的宏观统计数据也不断出现，数据显示的情况均十分严峻：中欧中创平台发布的，由清华大学经济管理学院金融系教授朱武祥，北京小微企业综合金融服务有限公司总经理刘军，北京大学汇丰商学院管理学教魏炜联名发布的针对995家中小企业的调研中显示，85.1%的中小企业表示账上现金余额能维持企业生存的时间不足三个月。
At the same time, macro statistics on the operation of SMEs continue to emerge, and the data show a grim picture: Zhuwu Xiang, Professor of Finance, School of Economics, Tsinghua University; Liu Jun, General Manager, Peking University; and Wei Wei, HSBC Business School Management, Peking University, showed that 85.1% of SMEs said cash balances on their books would last less than three months.
29.58%的企业估计疫情导致2020年营业收入下降幅度超过50%。
29.58 per cent of businesses estimated that the epidemic had led to a decline in operating revenue of more than 50 per cent in 2020.
舆论场中对中小企业生存境况的担忧渐成主流，舆论与现实的互动中，政府与平台商家两端对中小企业的扶持政策陆续出台。
In the public opinion field, the concern about the situation of the small and medium-sized enterprises has gradually become the mainstream. In the interaction between the public opinion and reality, the government and the platform businessmen have successively launched the supporting policies for SMEs.
一方面，龙湖、万达等地产平台商家发布租金优惠政策，同时，苏州市也率先于2月4日发布扶持市内小微企业的“苏十条”，提出了减免房租、提供稳定低息贷款等优惠方式。
On the one hand, Longhu, Wanda and other real estate platform businesses issued preferential rental policies, while Suzhou City on February 4 issued the first support for small and micro enterprises in the city, offering rent relief, stable low-interest loans and other preferential treatment.
同时，还针对中小企业在税费以及员工社会保险支出方面提出了减免措施，进一步降低企业支出额度。
At the same time, small and medium-sized enterprises in the tax and social insurance expenditures of employees proposed relief measures to further reduce the amount of enterprise expenditure.
一时间，各个省市，各个平台商家纷纷出台对旗下中小企业的保护政策，相关财经媒体对此进行了总结：例如，砺石商业评论总结到：《保护中小企业：疫情防控之外的第二战场》同时，在舆论场中，吴晓波、梁信军等企业界专业人士也纷纷就中小企业自救方法表达自己的观点：如公众号吴晓波频道发起“加油！老板”系列直播课，为中小企业主录制了8场应对疫情直播课。
However, there is no such thing as "Protect SMEs: A Second Battlefield Beyond Disease Prevention and Control." At the same time, business professionals such as Wu Xiaobo and Liang Xinjun expressed their views on SME self-help methods.
至2月21号，吴晓波频道公众号官方宣布已完成4场线上直播，观看数超1000万人次，同时后续企业课程包也收到了59987份来自企业的申请。
By February 21, Wu Xiaobo, the public, announced that it had completed four live broadcasts, watched more than 10 million views, and received 59987 applications from businesses.
危机客观上孕育着新的机会。
The crisis objectively breeds new opportunities.
商业的链接在传递风险的同时，也有可能传递价值：舆论场中，越来越多新鲜出现的线上经济形势被报道与关注。
Business links may convey value as well as risk: more and more new online economic situations are being reported and noticed in the media.
并渐渐催生出对“宅经济”火热的讨论。
And gradually give rise to the "home economy" fiery discussion.
南方周末发表报道：《生鲜电商“疫”外崛起》：报道了疫情环境中每日优鲜等生鲜电商采购量与消费量的大增。
Southern Weekend reported: "Fresh electricity business" outside the rise of "epidemic": reported in the epidemic environment, such as the daily good purchase volume and consumption of fresh electricity greatly increased.
三联生活周刊发表报道《无聊催生的狂欢：你“云蹦迪”了吗？》讲述了抖音上线的蹦迪直播的火热。
Triple Life Weekly reports "Boredom-induced Carnival: Are You" Cloud Jumping "?" about the fiery live Jumping on the Quiet Line.
而对于传统的线上娱乐游戏领域，各游戏媒体已纷纷以“最强手游春节档”描绘手游的强势表现。
For the traditional online entertainment game field, the game media have been "the strongest hand travel Spring Festival gear" to depict the strong performance of hand-travel.
在线上经济领域中，在线教育与在线办公承载了更多的关注与期待：梁信军在他于长江商学院所做的线上公开课中指出会把在线教育与在线办公两个行业“催熟”，培养用户与供应商两个主体的成熟度。
On-line economics, online education and online office bear more attention and expectation: In his online public lecture at Changjiang Business School, Mr Leung pointed out that he would "ripen" the online education and online office industries, developing the maturity of both users and suppliers.
有关二者的分析文章数量繁多。
There is a large number of analytical articles on both.
但是从之后舆论场的走向看，线上与线下仿佛没有那么容易割裂，仍存在许多需要解决的问题。
But after the trend of the public opinion field, online and offline seems not to be so easy to split, there are still many problems to be solved.
在线教育上，2月10日至2月24日，从小学至大学基本上迎来了“云开学”，社交媒体上时常出现“老师变主播”的调侃。
Online education, February 10 to 24, from the primary school to the university basically ushered in "Cloud School," social media often appear "teacher change anchor" ridicule.
但在最开始的新奇热度过后，一些讨论在线教育问题的报道开始出现：2月21日，公众号互联网江湖发表文章《集体“裸考”之后，在线教育没有“热度”》，分析在线教育存在“转化效果差、留存困难、在线学习效果难以比肩线下授课的弊端”。
But after the initial excitement, some discussion of online education began to appear: online education has no "heat" after the public Internet article "Naked Exam" on Feb. 21. Analyzing the disadvantages of online education are "poor transformation effect, retention difficulties and the difficulty in teaching online results."
而今日公众号半月谈发表文章《3亿师生“云开学”：差评不断，在线教育如何升级？》，主要讲述了，教师、家长、学生三方在新环境下所遭遇的难题，而对于线上办公来说，针对其固有的低效以及不适用性，自2月10日（周一）大范围复工日起，舆论场中关于“复工注意事项”、“复工小贴士”的内容也显著增多。
Today's half-month article, "300 million teachers and students" Cloud School: How to Upgrade Online Education ", mainly about the difficulties encountered by teachers, parents and students in the new environment, and the inherent ineffectiveness and inapplicability of the three-pronged approach to online work.
从聚焦危机，到讨论未来的风口方向，再到目前对线下复工的呼吁得到政府的引导与回应。
From focusing on the crisis to discussing the direction of the future, to the current call to resume work offline has been guided and responded to by the government.
商业界在逐渐回归常态与自身原本的角色。
The business community is gradually returning to normality and its original role.
然而对于中小企业来说，危机仍将长期客观存在。
However, for SMEs, the crisis will remain objective for a long time.
线上领域的短暂繁荣也需要依托于整体经济环境的常态化。
Short-term prosperity in the online world also depends on normalizing the overall economic environment.
对于不少行业的中小企业来说，尤其是线下餐饮、旅游业等依托于线下流量的产业而言，其消费性质的不可替代性客观上无法被解决。
For small and medium-sized enterprises in many industries, especially offline catering, tourism and other industries depending on offline flow, the irreplaceable nature of their consumption can not be objectively solved.
在持续的疫情影响中，很大一部分企业无法满足这种临时状态，需要一方面保证现金流通畅，一方面期盼真正的常态早日到来。
In the ongoing impact of the epidemic, a large proportion of enterprises are unable to meet this temporary situation, on the one hand to ensure smooth cash flow, on the one hand, and to hope for real normalcy as soon as possible.
03 | 坐标与平衡舆论场中，在全民持续严控疫情的同时，对另一种现象的反思开始出现。
At the same time as the population continues to maintain a tight grip on the epidemic, a rethink of another phenomenon has begun to emerge.
一方面，病例增长速度客观上出现下降，另一方面，过于“一刀切”防控措施带来的损失也进一步通过媒体和社交网络被看见。
On the one hand, there has been an objective decline in the rate of case growth, and on the other hand, losses from overly "one-size-fits-all" control measures have been increasingly visible through the media and social networks.
舆论场中呼吁社会从全面防治疫情的战时状态中解绑的声音开始显著出现，兼顾防疫与经济生活的观点在逐步抬头。
The voice of public opinion calling for the society to untie from the wartime state of comprehensive prevention and control of the epidemic began to emerge clearly, and the view of combining epidemic prevention with economic life gradually increased.
一刀切、层层加码的现象，具体表现在一些基层政府部门对于人员和物资流动的一刀切阻隔，将所属行政区域机械封闭。
One-size-fits-all, layer-coded phenomenon, concrete performance in some grass-roots government departments for the movement of people and materials across the cut-off, will be subordinate to the administrative region mechanical closure.
这样的防疫措施，成为加诸在企业头上的既疫情之外显性束缚。
Such epidemic prevention measures have become an overt straitjacket on top of the epidemic that afflicts enterprises.
早在一月末，就有媒体对以硬核防疫为名的一刀切防疫模式予以反思：1月29日，经济参考报发布时评《抗疫时评 | 升级防疫措施不能搞简单粗暴的“一刀切”》，文中提到，“一些地方政府尤其是基层政府已经将“防疫竞赛”蜕变成一哄而上的“军备竞赛”。
Back in late January, some media outlets reflected on a one-size-fits-all epidemic-prevention model in the name of hard immunization. When the Economic Reference Bureau issued its review on 29 January, it said that "some local governments, especially grass-roots ones, have transformed the epidemic prevention contest into a general arms race."
比如：国家卫健委提出“入网入格入家庭”筑牢社区疫情防控的第一道防线；有的地方政府随意升级防疫操作，默许或鼓励村委会挖路“封村”、贴标语“封户”，引发对武汉归乡人群的歧视和攻击；有的县政府印发红头文件禁止湖北、广东、浙江、重庆等省份车辆入境，激起了不同省份之间的官民对立。
For example, some local governments have raised the level of prevention and control of epidemic diseases in their communities; others have tacitly approved or encouraged village committees to dig roads and put up signs to seal the door; and some have issued red-headed documents forbidding entry of vehicles from provinces such as Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Chongqing, sparking official-civilian antagonism among different provinces.
个体再次成为反思的传播点，《人物》发表调查报道《在高速公路上漂流》，记录了货运司机肖红兵的故事：由于各地高速公路封闭，关口检查人员由于其车牌为湖北省而拒绝其进入，因而他无法进入驶入城市休息，只能于高速公路上不间断行驶4天4夜，最后与交警协商于服务区暂住。
Once again, the individual became a point of reflection, and People published a survey report, Drifting on the Highway, documenting the story of Xiao Hongbing, a freight driver who was denied entry because his license plate was Hubei Province. As a result, he could not enter the city to rest, drove continuously on the expressway for four days and nights, and finally settled in service areas with traffic police.
这样的“硬核防疫”措施原本是为疫情最严苛时期的湖北地区所指定，作用于初期的疫情防控严打期尚有其合理性所在。
Such "hard core epidemic prevention" measures were originally designated for Hubei area during the most severe period of the epidemic.
但是伴随着各省2月10日复工期的到来以及湖北以外地区疫情新增病例的连续降低，部分基层“运动式”的严控，让企业复工需求成为空中楼阁，导致舆论场中的反对声音越来越大。
But with the resumption of construction on February 10 in the provinces and the continuous decline in the number of new cases outside Hubei, some grassroots "sport-like" controls have made the demand for the resumption of work a castle in the air, leading to growing opposition in the public opinion.
2月10日，中国新闻周刊发表报道《首批复工企业难超三分之一，中小企业逼近生存红线》，表明很多企业因“外地员工无法返岗，物资无法送达，根本开不了工”。
On February 10, China News Weekly reported that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were close to the red line of survival after the first batch of enterprises returned to work, indicating that many enterprises were unable to return to work because of "the inability of non-resident workers to return to work, goods can not be delivered, simply can not open."
两天后，国务院常务会议与政治局常务会议释放出的政策信号，带动了舆论场中一系列对“一刀切”问题深入反思深入研究的文章的出现，也带动了之后一系列的政策变化。
Two days later, policy signals from the State Council's executive meeting and the Politburo's executive meeting prompted a series of in-depth reflections on "one-size-fits-all" issues in the public opinion, and a series of subsequent policy changes.
2月12日的国务院常务会议中，要求“在切实做好各项防控工作同时，有序推进企业复工复产，同时，明确提出“主要劳务输出地与输入地要做好农民工等重点人群返岗的对接和服务。
At the regular meeting of the State Council on February 12, the government demanded that "while effectively carrying out all prevention and control work, we should promote the resumption of industrial production in an orderly manner, and clearly state that" major labor exporting areas and receiving areas should do a good job of docking and serving key groups such as migrant workers. "
纠正对外来车辆和人员“一刀切”劝返等做法。
Correcting the "one size fits all" approach to persuasion of foreign vehicles and personnel.
”随后，政治局常务会议通稿发布，同样提到，非疫情防控重点地区要以实行分区分级精准防控为抓手，统筹疫情防控与经济社会秩序恢复。
Subsequently, the Standing Committee of the Politburo issued a circular, also mentioning that the key areas of non-epidemic prevention and control should focus on the implementation of zoning and precise prevention and control, and overall planning for disease control and economic and social order restoration.
要按照科学防治、精准施策原则，以县域为单元，确定不同县域风险等级，分区分级制定差异化防控策略。
In accordance with the principles of scientific control and precise policy, county areas as units to determine the risk level of different counties, zoning to formulate differentiated prevention and control strategies.
各级党委和政府要实事求是做好防控工作，对偏颇和极端做法要及时纠正，不搞简单化一关了之、一停了之，尽可能减少疫情防控对群众生产生活的影响。
Party committees at all levels and the government should do a good job in prevention and control, correct biased and extreme practices in a timely manner, and not simplify and stop them, so as to minimize the impact of epidemic prevention and control on people's lives and production.
“统筹疫情防控与经济社会秩序恢复”，纠正“对外来车辆和人员‘一刀切’劝返”等做法，成为官方释放的行政信号，表明中国社会在大方向上逐渐开始从全面抗疫的“战时状态”缓释。
"Overall planning for the prevention and control of the epidemic and the restoration of economic and social order," and rectifying practices such as "one-size-fits-all" advice to foreign vehicles and personnel, have become administrative signals of official release, indicating that Chinese society is gradually beginning to release from the "wartime state" of full-scale epidemic prevention and control.
随后，媒体对于一刀切的相关报道不断增多，呼吁全面复工的声音逐渐占据主流。
Subsequently, media coverage of one-size-fits-all coverage increased and voices calling for a full return to work gradually took hold.
2月13日，「泽平宏观」公众号发布恒大研究院相关研究报告，《警惕各地防控疫情“一刀切、层层加码”现象》，直接点名了即使有优惠政策，但目前的疫情防控体系仍在让企业蒙受大批损失的现状。
On February 13, the public issue of "Zepin Macro" released the related research report of the Hang Seng University Research Institute. "Beware of the phenomenon of" one-size-fits-all, layer-adding "epidemic prevention and control.
报告中提到，严厉疫情防控导致的人员返程受阻，物资运输不畅，以及许多政府仍在沿用的一刀切式停工令，让目前大批服务业企业仍然大面积停工、拖延复工，尽管种种配套措施已经下达，但是企业仍需要为停工损失买单，现金流压力剧增。
The report says severe disease control has hampered returns, disrupted supplies, and the one-size-fits-all shutdown orders still in use by many governments, leaving a large number of service-sector companies to shut down and delay the resumption of work. Companies still have to pay for work stoppage losses and cash flow pressures have soared.
2月16日起，《环球时报》总编胡锡进也发表了呼吁复工的微博，微博中提到，“鼓励复工也作为口号喊了起来，但是复工的很多现实条件仍然残缺不全，甚至缺少推动它们快速形成的实际动力，比如很多地方不鼓励在外地的工作者迅速返回，一些单位不敢让员工大规模上班，另外各地政府轻易不敢鼓励人们在加强自我防护的基础上外出消费，没有哪个城市敢在恢复社会正常状态方面冒头。
Since February 16, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, has also posted a micro-blog calling for a return to work. "Many of the practical conditions for resuming work are incomplete and lack the practical impetus to get back to work.
”在与舆论场的相互影响中，复工的步伐得以缓步推进，新一轮地方动员开始：2月16日，首趟农民工复工专列从贵阳出发，前往杭州返岗复工。
In the interaction with the public opinion field, the pace of returning to work has been slowed down and a new round of local mobilization has begun: on February 16, the first migrant workers returned to work from Guiyang by train from Guiyang.
随后，四川、重庆、河南、湖南纷纷开辟农民工返工专列，助力农民工返城务工。
Subsequently, Sichuan, Chongqing, Henan, Hunan Province opened up migrant workers to re-work train, to help migrant workers back to the city.
22日，「21世纪经济报道」公众号发布数据新闻作品全国复工地图，统计了各省工业企业的复工进度。
22, "21st Century Economic Report," the public release of data news works of the national map, industrial enterprises in the provinces to return to work progress.
总体数据，许多省份的工业复工率已在50%之上。
Overall, the industrial return rate in many provinces is above 50 per cent.
同时，南京、广州、甘肃等地也陆续宣布，餐饮业、商场等也可开工营业，在复工的浪潮中，企业在挣扎中尝试将经营生活恢复。
At the same time, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Gansu and other places have also announced that catering, shopping malls and so on can also start business, in the back of the wave of workers, enterprises in the struggle to restore business life.
自2月12号至今，恢复生产、全面复工已成为舆论场中绝对的主旋律：2月24日，《财新周刊》将封面报道定为了展现复工复产全过程的《复工预备起》，2月27日，《三联生活周刊》新冠特刊系列的第三期同样是全方位展现复工主题的《准备复工》。
From February 12 to the present, the resumption of production and full resumption of work has become an absolute theme in the media: On 24 February, the cover story was designated as Resumption of Work by the Financial Resources Weekly. On 27 February, the third issue of the special issue of Triple Life Weekly's new crown series was also a full-scale restarting work.
同时，封面报道「学会与疫情相处」的副标题同样引人注目。
At the same time, the subtitle "Learn to live with the epidemic" on the cover is equally striking.
对于大批企业来说，复工的浪潮并不意味着抗疫的结束，而是新一轮考验的到来。
For a large number of enterprises, the return to work wave does not mean the end of the epidemic, but a new test.
接下来，他们要面对的是如何与疫情相处，平衡将成为关键。
The next thing they have to face is how to get along with the epidemic, and balance will be the key.
任泽平表示，春节档的失去，返程复工的推迟造成的损失已不可挽回且难以估量，旅游、餐饮、酒店、交运、地产等受重灾行业，占GDP和就业比重高达30%，带来的是前途未卜的GDP走势与就业形势。
Ren said the loss of the Spring Festival holiday and the delay in returning to work were irreversible and incalculable, with tourism, restaurants, hotels, delivery and real estate suffering serious disasters accounting for as much as 30% of GDP and employment, creating an uncertain outlook for GDP and employment.
而梁信军在长江商学院的公开课上预测，受疫情影响，可能带来中小企业的倒闭、失业人口的增加、家庭收入的下降，进而形成第二波的需求和供应方面的冲击。
At the Changjiang School of Business, Liang predicted that the impact of the epidemic could lead to the collapse of small and medium-sized enterprises, an increase in unemployment and a decline in household income, creating a second wave of demand and supply-side shocks.
这个冲击，预计在四月五月也不会结束。
The shock is not expected to end in April or May.
当舆论场中对企业关注的焦点从抗疫变为开工时，本身就形成了一个融合了现状与未来的提醒。
When the focus of public opinion on business has shifted from fighting the epidemic to starting work, it is itself a reminder of the status quo and the future.
在“未来总会到来”的期盼下，对当下现象的记录，成为了社会组织进化的现实教案。
In the hope of "the future will always come," the record of the current phenomenon has become a reality of social organization evolution teaching plan.
在疫情爆发之时，市场技术与效率优势填补了行政力量难以触达的盲点，行政力量随后成为了大局指挥的关键要素。
When the outbreak occurred, market technology and efficiency advantages filled the blind spots difficult to reach the executive power, which then became a key element of overall command.
但在新的阶段，当市场中各类经济体本身有了更多的常态化需求时，行政力量帮扶政策与一刀切式的掣肘却形成了一对矛盾。
But in the new phase, when there is more demand for normalisation among the various economies in the market, there is a contradiction between administrative-power-support policies and one-size-fits-all constraints.
在多轮自上而下动员、自下而上的权衡后，复工的节奏关乎某种平衡。
After several rounds of top-down mobilization and bottom-up trade-offs, the pace of returning to work is a matter of balance.
庞大的社会治理体系中，市场与行政坐标系的互动，永远都需要讨论的空间和优化的意愿，永远都有寻找最优解的需求。
In the huge social governance system, the interaction between the market and administrative coordinate system will always need to discuss the space and the desire to optimize, and there will always be a need to find the optimal solution.
