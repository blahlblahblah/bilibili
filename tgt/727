房企高管们普遍认为，调整税收与限购政策，是对自己立竿见影的帮助文|《财经》记者王博 实习生 郭明骏编辑|马克2月9日，部分头部房企再次宣布延长复工时间，截至发稿前，正荣、融创、龙湖、滨江等房企将复工时间推迟至2月17日。

“整个行业得缓半年”李浩是融创在江苏省的销售人员。

他告诉《财经》，目前公司并没有明确销售人员何时复工，估计是2月17日。

"It was early last year and we were planning to start early this year, and now everything is in a mess," said an executive at Wanda Commercial Xian.
由于疫情，万达全国各地商场基本关停，此前，万达曾宣布将减免所有商户一个月的租金和万达广场的物业费，共约40亿元。
Because of the outbreak, Wanda stores across the country were closed, after the announcement that all merchants will be reduced one month's rent and the property costs of Wanda Square, a total of about $4 billion.

“我们没有发布明确的行情预测，毕竟疫情来的很突然，但就目前情况来看，近两个月应该都不会好。
"We don't have a clear market forecast. After all, the situation is very sudden, but as things stand, the last two months should not be good.
”链家已经为2-3月份安排了大量的内部学习内容和培训，刘枫认为，这说明公司预计在此期间的客户带看和成交量会大幅度降低。
The chain already arranges a lot of in-house learning and training for February to March, which, Ms. Liu argues, indicates that the company expects the number of customers to take in and trade significantly lower over the period.
施工与土地拍卖均停摆复工之后的地产行业，除了销售，建筑施工和拿地也受到了不少影响。
Construction and land auction are suspended after the resumption of the real estate industry, in addition to sales, construction and take a lot of impact.
一位万科、融创等很多一线房企的分包商告诉《财经》记者，往年他们要求管理人员正月十五之前到岗做准备，普通工人正月二十左右能到岗80-90%。
A subcontractor for Vanke, Fuchuang and many other first-tier housing companies told Caijing that in previous years they had required managers to be on duty by the 15th of the first month, and that the average worker would be around 80 to 90 percent of their jobs by January 20.
但今年总包商到现在也没给出复工时间，大家都在等消息。
But so far this year, the contractor has not given time to resume work, and everyone is waiting for news.
现在他们每天都在线上对返乡的工人们做调查问卷，为复工做准备。
Now they are preparing to get back to work by using an online survey of returning workers every day.
调查内容主要是身体是否正常，接到复工通知是否能及时到岗，是否来自湖北等重点疫区，村庄是否处于封闭状态，开车是否能进出等。
The main content of the investigation is whether the body is normal, whether the resumption of work notice can be timely to the post, whether from Hubei and other key epidemic areas, whether the villages are in a closed state, whether the driving can enter and leave.
“从调查数据来看，工人们的返工意愿很强烈。
"According to the survey data, there is a strong desire to rework.
”这位分包商希望，疫情在2月底之前能有转机。
The subcontractor hopes to see a turnaround by the end of February.
目前大部分省市都把复工时间改到正月十五之后或者是二月末，而往年建筑工地的工人也是正月十五以后上班。
Most provinces and cities have rescheduled their work to after the 15th of the first month or the end of February, and construction workers used to work after the 15th of the first month.
但就算2月末复工，生产也要滞后，因为复工工人回来后需要隔离14天，车间可能问题不大，但工地人员混杂，肯定要延误工期。
But even if work resumes in late February, production will lag behind, as the workers will need to be quarantined for 14 days upon their return.
“我们的调查数据显示，很多关键岗位工人所在的村庄都被封闭管理，到岗时间没法估计，到岗后即便开发商急于赶工期，但政府也会干预。
"Our survey data show that many of the villages where workers in key jobs are located are sealed off to an incalculable time frame, and even when developers are in a hurry to meet the deadline, the government will intervene."
”分包商说。
"said the subcontractor.
目前多地开工日定为2月10日，已经比正常开工日延迟了10日左右。
Work is currently scheduled to commence on 10 February, some 10 days later than the normal start date.
推迟时间最长的恒大，要求2月20日前不得开工。
The longest delay, Constant, required that no construction be carried out before 20 February.
关于复工日，各地政府要求不一。
With regard to back-to-work days, Governments have varied.
2月6日，南京市公告各建筑工地复工时间不得早于2月9日24时，并鼓励企业根据疫情形势，结合工地实际，延迟或错峰复工；深圳要求不早于2月10日，但开工前要做好相关备案；郑州是目前复工日期最晚的，要求房地产工程直至3月6日方可复工，售楼部暂缓开门。
On February 6, Nanjing announced that the resumption of work on various construction sites should not be earlier than 2400 hours on February 9 and encouraged enterprises to resume work in accordance with the epidemic situation. Shenzhen requires no earlier than February 10, but the relevant records should be made before the start of construction.
龙湖财务部门的一位员工对《财经》表示，其实政府财政收入上的压力也很大，一边想尽快开工，一边又怕大规模复工让疫情更加严重。
'There is a lot of pressure on government revenue, 'an employee at Longhu Financial told Caijing.' We want to start work as soon as possible, but we're afraid the massive resumption of work will make the situation worse.
上述分包商则表示，虽然现在复工日期未定，但他们不会裁员，相信很多大企业首先想到的方法也不会是裁员。
The subcontractors say they will not lay off workers, though the date is not set, and believe that the first thing many big companies will think about is not to lay off workers.
“大部分员工都是熟练工人，培养出来不容易，裁掉以后想再招到类似技能的员工就太难了，毕竟中国现在是用工荒。
"Most workers are skilled workers and it's not easy to grow them," he said. "After all, it's hard to hire people with similar skills in the future.
”与建筑工地一起的停摆的是土地拍卖市场。
Along with the construction site, the land auction market is on hold.
“出不了门，除非网上拍卖。
"Not out of doors, unless auctioned online.
”前述中交集团区域总担心，很多在2019年高举高打高周转的房企会“断粮”。
The CIMC region has been concerned that many high-profile housing companies will be "off food" in 2019.
2019年受金融监管和周期性调控的影响，很多房企都处于钱紧的阶段，只有保持快拿地、快开工、快销售高周转的模式，才能保持现金流。
Due to financial regulation and cyclical regulation in 2019, many housing companies are in a tight cash-flow situation, which can only be maintained by maintaining a fast-track model of quick land acquisition, quick start-ups and fast-selling.
虽然营销、买地、建设的步伐都放缓，影响了房企的现金流，但银行利息和到期债务都要准时支付，否则就有违约、降低信用评级的风险，这会让房企将来的融资成本进一步升高。
While the pace of marketing, buying land and construction has slowed, affecting cash flow, banks pay interest and maturing debt on time, or risk defaulting and lowering their credit ratings, raising the cost of future housing finance.
如果疫情得不到有效控制，重仓疫情较严重地区的房企的现金流会更紧张。
If the epidemic is not effectively controlled, the cash flow of housing companies in the worst-affected areas will be more tight.
压力虽大，但本轮抗击疫情，地产商们却反应迅速，积极驰援湖北。
Despite the pressure, but the current round of the fight against the epidemic, property developers responded quickly, actively to help Hubei.
目前，百家房企累计捐款近14亿元，多家地产公司设立疫情基金，并向疫情严重地区捐赠口罩、蔬菜等必备物资。
At present, 100 housing enterprises have donated nearly 1.4 billion yuan, and a number of real estate companies have set up epidemic funds and donated necessary materials such as masks and vegetables to areas with serious epidemics.
春节前后，全国大量商场停业，中小店主货物积压，损失惨重。
Spring Festival around a large number of stores closed, small and medium-sized shopkeeper goods backlog, heavy losses.
万达、金茂、富力、华润置地、融创文旅集团等房企陆续公布了减免全体商户租金的公告，时间从半个月到一个月不等。
Wanda, Jinmao, Fu Li, China Resources Land, integrated arts and tourism groups and other housing companies have announced a reduction or reduction in rent for all merchants, the period of half a month to a month.
对于银行是否会放宽信贷标准，多位房企高管表示，暂时没有，但应该会有。
A number of senior housing executives said there was no immediate easing of credit standards, but there should be.
万科的两位区域财务高管希望在税收减缓，预售条件、按揭、限购政策放宽，以及行政审批效率提高上能有所改变。
Vanke's two regional financial executives hope to see changes in tax relief, pre-sale conditions, mortgages, restrictions on purchases, and more efficient administrative approvals.
他们认为，这比放宽融资条件对解决短期现金流问题更有帮助。
That, they argue, would help solve short-term cash-flow problems more than easing financing conditions.
