爱好二次元的他寒假期间报了语言班学习日语，准备毕业后去日本从事声优行业的工作。

开始以为只是普通的感冒，贾虎并未在意。
At first thought it was just a common cold, Jia Hu did not care.
直到1月21号，浑身酸疼的症状仍未缓解，疫情相关的报道也逐渐多了起来，贾虎一家人意识到“可能出问题了”，遂立即就医；1月29日，贾虎的核酸检测结果显示为双阳性，正式被确诊为感染新冠肺炎。
Until Jan. 21, the symptoms of aches and pains continued unabated, reports of the outbreak increased, the Jia Hu family became aware of "a possible problem," and immediately sought medical attention.

他告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn），在这段经历中，特别感谢医护人员。
He told the roaring news (www.thepper.cn) that, in the course of that experience, special thanks went to the medical staff.
在医院的时候，他曾注意到一个细节，医生的隔离服品牌每隔几天就会变，杜邦，稳健，3M，金佰利……“一问才知道，医院采购的早用完了，这些都是社会捐赠的，他们都是英雄。
At the hospital, he noticed a detail, the doctor's isolation clothing brand will change every few days, DuPont, steady, 3M, Kimberly-Clark... "Only when asked did I know that the hospital had run out of hospital purchases, these were donations from the community, they were heroes.
”贾虎说。
"said Jia Hu.
【贾虎口述】“确诊的那几天太难受了”1月17日，那天我在语言学校上课，感觉自己浑身酸痛，可能已经开始发烧了。
"The days of diagnosis were terrible," Jia said. On January 17, when I was attending a language school, I felt sore all over and I probably began to have a fever.
以为只是普通感冒，我开始服用泰诺，现在想想，泰诺的舒缓作用很有可能掩盖了病情，有点后悔。
Thinking it was just a common cold, I started taking Tyler. Now think about it, the soothing effects of Tyler are likely to be masked and slightly repentant.
1月21日中午，我感觉身体非常酸痛，就联系了我爸，他敏锐地意识到可能出问题了，叫我赶紧回家。
At noon on January 21st, feeling very sore, I contacted my father, who was keenly aware that something might be wrong and told me to hurry home.
傍晚在家量体温，低烧，但我身体仍无特别感觉，因为吃了火锅，我妈提出晚点量体温，如果还是低烧就去医院。
In the evening, I had a low fever and a temperature at home, but I still had no special feeling. Because of the hot pot, my mother asked me to take my temperature later and go to the hospital if I still had a low fever.
晚上11点发现仍然低烧，就立刻去了同济医院。
At 11 pm found still low fever, immediately went to Tongji Hospital.
到那之后发现人很多，我第一次看到医生穿隔离服，病历堆积成山，感觉气氛不太对劲，于是决定去不远处的武汉肺科医院。
When I first saw a doctor in an isolation suit and his medical records piled up in a bad mood, I decided to go to Wuhan Lung Hospital not far away.
顺利挂上急诊后，我查了血常规、肝功能、肺部CT，CT当晚就出结果了，斑片状影，双下肺感染。
After successfully hanging up the emergency, I checked the routine blood, liver function, lung CT, CT results on the night, patchy shadow, both lower lung infections.
第二天出来的肝功能显示一切正常，血常规也一切正常，只是超敏C反应蛋白（CRP）略高。
The liver function came out the next day and normal blood flow, except for a slightly higher supersensitive C-reactive protein (CRP).
1月25日前后我逐渐开始咳嗽，带有极少量痰，很难咳出。
On or about January 25, I gradually began to cough, with very little sputum, difficult to cough out.
我去武汉肺科医院复查，结果显示病情加重，感染扩散至全肺。
I went to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital to review the results showed that the disease worsened, the infection spread to the whole lung.
CRP升高一般提示急性感染加重，我的CRP飙升至39.76，医生开出输液处方。
CRP hikes generally indicate an increase in acute infections, and my CRP soared to 39.76, with doctors prescribing infusions.
第二天起床格外困难，我不断打着寒战，一量体温超过39度。
Getting up the next day was extremely difficult. I kept shivering and my temperature exceeded 39 degrees.
开始家中隔离，待在房间内基本不出来。
Start home isolation, stay in room basically do not come out.
28日复查的时候，我肺部感染的情况有所好转，专家组会诊后给了我试剂盒测试资格。
By the time of my 28-day review, my lung infection had improved and I was given a kit qualification by the panel.
1月29日，我的试剂盒结果新冠病毒双阳性，正式被确诊，医院免费发放了5天的艾滋病毒抗逆转录药物克力芝。
On 29 January, my test kit turned out to be double positive for the new crown virus, and the hospital distributed the HIV antiretroviral drug Kaletra free of charge for five days.
由于我的病情继续好转，医院床位紧张，医生叫我回家继续隔离，输液停止，口服药还继续吃着。
As my condition continued to improve, the hospital bed was tight, the doctor told me to go home to continue isolation, the infusion stopped, oral medicine continued to eat.
那几天真的太难受了，又呕吐又腹泻，咳嗽咳的我整个背都是疼的，也没有食欲。
Those days are really too uncomfortable, vomit and diarrhea, cough my whole back is painful, there is no appetite.
但不吃东西抵抗力上不去，我只好逼着自己吃饭。
But I can't resist eating, so I have to force myself to eat.
“痊愈后最想做的事情是听偶像的演唱会”病情好转后，我又接受了试剂盒检测。
"Healing the most wanted thing is to listen to the idol concert" after the condition improved, I received a kit test.
分别检测了两次，结果都为阴性，我痊愈了。
I had two separate tests, both negative, and I recovered.
回顾治愈的经历，我真的很幸运，活过来后，会更加努力去生活。
Looking back on the healing experience, I'm really lucky to be able to live much harder when I live.
现在我恢复的很好，没有什么后遗症，基本和生病前是一样的。
I'm doing fine now, no after-effects, basically the same as before I got sick.
等疫情过去，我最想做的事情就是去听我偶像大桥彩香的演唱会。
When the epidemic is over, all I want to do is listen to my idol bridge concert.
生病期间我看了偶像配音的动漫，给了我很大鼓舞。
During my illness, I watched the animation of the idol dubbing, which gave me a lot of encouragement.
武汉封城之后，城市交通停运，很多没有条件的人没办法去医院，耽搁了病情，我心里挺难受的，我唯一庆幸的是我们家里还有辆车。
Wuhan after the closure of the city, many people do not have the conditions to go to the hospital, delayed the disease, I feel very uncomfortable, I am only lucky that we have a car.
除此之外，在治病期间也遇到了很多让我比较震惊，比较难过的事情。
In addition, during the treatment of illness also encountered a lot of let me more shocked, more sad things.
有一次在医院输液，我旁边的一位老爷爷胳膊肿的老高，吓了我一跳。
Once in the hospital infusion, I next to an old grandfather swollen arms, scared me a jump.
可能是因为老年人血管比较脆，跑针了。
Probably because older people have brittle blood vessels, running needles.
这个老爷爷身边也没人陪护，病人又很多，护士们没有注意到。
The old grandfather was not accompanied by anyone, and the patients were so many that the nurses did not notice.
我赶紧帮他叫来护士，针一拔，老爷爷手背上满是血，真是不忍心看。
I hastened to help him call a nurse, a needle pulled out, grandfather's back full of blood, really can not bear to see.
还有一次我看到一位八十几岁的老奶奶，在病床上吸氧。
Another time I saw an eighty-year-old woman taking oxygen from her hospital bed.
她吸氧的那个声音像是在呻吟，听着都能感觉到她很难受，（那个）声音我忘不掉。
The sound she breathed seemed to moan, and I could feel it, and I couldn't forget it.
希望病人们都心平气和，别对医生护士发脾气，他们在一线都是拿命去拼。
I hope patients are calm, do not angry with the doctors and nurses, they are on the line to fight for their lives.
在医院的时候我还注意到一个细节，医生的隔离服品牌每隔几天就会变，杜邦，稳健，3M，金佰利……一问才知道，医院采购的早用完了，这些都是社会捐赠的，他们都是英雄。
When I was in the hospital, I also noticed a detail, the doctor's isolation clothing brand will change every few days, DuPont, steady, 3M, Kimberly-Clark... only to know that the hospital procurement has run out, these are social donations, they are heroes.
