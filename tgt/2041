澎湃新闻记者 赵实2月23日，是武汉与武汉人特别的一天。
Zhao Shi, a journalist, was a special day for Wuhan and Wuhan people on February 23.
一个月之前的1月23日，武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布1号通告，决定于当日10时关闭离汉通道，实施封城管理。
A month ago today (January 23), the Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command for the New Coronavirus Infection in Wuhan issued Notice No. 1, in which it was decided to close the Han Passage at 10: 00 a.m. on the same day to enforce the closure of the city.
也是在这一天的16时，仍然身处武汉抗疫前线的国务院新闻办，召开了一场记者见面会，邀请在武汉疫情防控一线的普通工作者讲述他们团结奋战的故事，并回答记者提问。
At 16: 00 on the same day, the State Council Information Office, still on the front line of the Wuhan epidemic, held a meeting with journalists and invited ordinary workers on the front lines of the Wuhan epidemic to tell their stories of solidarity and answer questions from journalists.
这也是国务院新闻办历年所举办的各类发布活动之中，最为特殊的一场——发布桌被简单的桌椅代替，没有人准备讲稿和资料，发言嘉宾面对镜头时还会时常因为紧张而双手紧握。
This was one of the most special events held by the Information Office of the State Council in the past year.The publishing table was replaced by simple desks and chairs, no one prepared speeches and materials, and speakers often clenched their hands in front of the camera.

他们原本只是城市森林中无比平凡的一部分，如果不是因为这场疫情，仍旧还在平凡的岗位与生活中度过平凡的日常。
They were originally just a very ordinary part of the urban forest, if not because of the outbreak, still in ordinary posts and life spent ordinary everyday.
但此刻，身处在风暴核心的武汉，面对疫情传播的风险，他们选择奋身而出，在艰难战疫的这一个月里，从未停止付出与坚守。
But now, at the heart of the storm, Wuhan, faced with the risk of spreading the epidemic, has chosen to step forward and stay the course throughout the difficult month of the epidemic.
“我身边的这些工作者，他们非常普通，就像我们的同学、邻居，每天在大街上擦身而过的行人。
"The people I work with are very ordinary people, like our classmates, neighbors, passers-by on the streets every day.
但是面对疫情，无数位像他们一样的普通工作者选择了坚强和勇敢，选择了担当和奉献。
But in the face of the epidemic, countless ordinary workers like them have chosen to be strong and brave, to take responsibility and dedication.
”国务院新闻办新闻局副局长、新闻发言人袭艳春，在主持这场记者会时，声音哽咽而动容。

可是随着疫情愈发严重，我也感到害怕，就准备开始休息。

From that moment on, he began to receive orders from all sorts of people, and was moved by the warmth of all kinds.
外卖骑手吴辉“我把这些温暖和感动都记录在微博上，收到了全国各地数以万计网友的支持和鼓励，所有的这些支持鼓励，以及越来越多骑手兄弟的守望相助，让我不再害怕。
"I recorded the warmth and touch on Weibo and received support and encouragement from tens of thousands of netizens from all over the country. All this support and support from more and more rider brothers kept me from being afraid.
”吴辉说，这场疫情，也让外卖骑手们的工作被赋予了新的含义，他们成为了维系城市正常运转的摆渡人。
Wu said the outbreak has also given new meaning to the work of takeaway riders, who become ferrymen who keep the city running.
“我相信只要我们都在，武汉就不会孤独！”吴辉说。
"I believe that as long as we are all here, Wuhan will not be lonely!" Wu said.
