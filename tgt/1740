2月20日，广东省发布《广东省餐饮服务业新冠肺炎防控工作指引》，指导餐饮经营单位在疫情期间逐步恢复堂食服务。
On February 20, Guangdong Province issued "Guidelines on the Prevention and Control of New Crown Pneumonia in Guangdong's Food and Beverage Service Industry," guiding the catering business units to gradually resume catering services during the epidemic period.
按照工作指引，广东以县（市、区）为单元划分防控区，并根据疫情现状及发展态势，按照近14天新增报告确诊病例数、近14天新增报告本地感染确诊病例数、近14天是否发生本地暴发疫情等标准，分为Ⅰ级、Ⅱ级、Ⅲ级、Ⅳ级共四个等级。
In accordance with the work guidelines, Guangdong is divided into four categories: county (city and district) for prevention and control, and according to the current situation and development of the disease, the number of newly confirmed cases reported in the past 14 days, the number of confirmed local infections reported in the past 14 days, and whether there has been a local outbreak in the past 14 days.
图片来源：广州日报广东省新冠肺炎防控指挥部办公室疫情防控组副组长耿庆山介绍，由于广东目前没有Ⅰ级防控区，因此根据指引，具备合法经营资格的餐饮店均可开业，但在堂食上有所限制。
Guang Qingshan, vice-chairman of the epidemic prevention and control group at Guangdong's Xinguan Pneumonia Command Office, said the guidelines allow restaurants with legitimate business qualifications to open but have restrictions on Don's food because Guangdong does not currently have a Class I control area.
Ⅱ级防控区暂停堂食服务，但可开放包间服务。
Class II control areas are temporarily suspended for canteen service, but can be opened for private room service.
Ⅲ级防控区进行限制性堂食服务，提倡减少桌椅摆放、隔桌安排就餐，用餐人员进入餐饮经营单位前必须测量体温，每桌登记至少一名就餐客人的姓名和联系方式。
