小娃娃可以不问世事，无忧无虑，但我们成人能够在困难时期依然生活安稳实为不易，要感谢很多人幕后悉心的付出。
Dolls can come out of the world and be carefree, but it's not easy for us adults to be able to live comfortably in difficult times, thanks to the dedication of many people behind the scenes.
口述 | 陈先生整理 | 金　姬我是上海人，20年前因为新加坡教育部的一个项目而有机会到当地念大学，毕业后留在那里工作生活至今。
I am from Shanghai, where I had the opportunity to go to university 20 years ago as a result of a project with the Singapore Ministry of Education, and have stayed and worked there ever since.
因为上海人的“拎得清”，所以我在讲究规则的新加坡很适应。
Because Shanghainese "carry clear", so I in the rule-based Singapore is very adapt.
我感觉，此次新冠疫情之下，两地的防控措施各有千秋，都很有效。
I feel that under this new crown epidemic, the two places have different control measures, are very effective.
今年1月18日，我带着太太和2岁的女儿回上海父母的家过春节，回来前并没有看到关于武汉疫情的任何消息。
On January 18, I returned to my parents' home in Shanghai for the Spring Festival with my wife and two-year-old daughter.
在沪前几天照例走亲访友，出门游玩。
In the past few days in Shanghai as usual visits friends, go out to play.
可不久武汉宣布封城，上海也紧急采取措施，一时上海各大公共场所、公园纷纷关闭，市民被要求在家自我隔离，减少不必要外出。
But soon Wuhan announced the closure of the city, Shanghai also took emergency measures, major public places, parks have been closed, citizens were asked to isolate themselves at home, reduce unnecessary travel.
虽然我们并不紧张，但也还是老老实实宅在家里过年了。
Although we are not nervous, but still stay at home for the New Year.
宅在上海家中的同时，还得不时关注新加坡对于疫情的一举一动。
Home in Shanghai, but also have to pay attention to the Singapore epidemic from time to time.
新加坡是1月23日出现第一例确诊病例的，最初的几个病例都是来自武汉的游客。
Singapore was the first confirmed case on January 23, with the first cases coming from Wuhan.
当时曾有新加坡民众建议政府禁止所有中国人入境。
At the time, Singaporeans suggested that the government ban all Chinese from entering the country.
新加坡教育部长王乙康当时代表政府出声，说要“将心比心，己所不欲勿施于人”，号召新加坡人不要对外来人口有排斥心，应当齐心协力共渡难关。
Speaking on behalf of the government, Minister of Education Wang Yikang called on Singaporeans not to be ostracized by outsiders and to work together to tide them over.
这给了年后即将回新的我们吃了些许定心丸。
It gives us some reassurance that we will be back in the next year.
我们一家三口根据预订的行程于1月27日年初三飞回新加坡。
The three of us flew back to Singapore on the third day of January 27 according to our scheduled itinerary.
我们戴着口罩前去浦东机场，在上海也好，在转机的香港也好，遇到的每个人也都是口罩严实，行路匆匆。
We went to Pudong Airport wearing masks, and everyone we met in Shanghai and Hong Kong in transit was wearing a mask and walking hurriedly.
机舱里交谈的人变少了，不少人闭目不语，气氛有些沉重。
There were fewer people talking in the cabin, many were silent, and the atmosphere was a little heavy.
但凌晨时分抵达新加坡樟宜机场后，却并没有发现有严格的检疫措施，特别令我惊讶的是，作为机场海关门户的边检人员，居然没有一个人戴口罩。
When I arrived at Singapore's Changi Airport in the early hours of the morning, however, no strict quarantine measures were observed. In particular, I was surprised that none of the border control officers at the airport's customs portal wore masks.
我在上海机场时就接获信息，新加坡政府规定教育部旗下的所有大中小学校和幼儿园，对近期访问过中国的职员和学生须强制14天在家隔离。
When I was at Shanghai airport, I was told that the government required all schools, colleges and kindergartens under the Ministry of Education to force 14 days of home segregation for staff and students who had recently visited China.
对于员工来说，这是特别应对疫情的缺席假(Leave of Absence)，不扣薪水，不计入年假病假。
For staff, this is Leave of Absencein, a special response to the epidemic, without withholding of pay and excluding annual leave sick leave.
在学校工作的我和上幼儿园的女儿必须从回新后立即遵行。
My daughter in kindergarten and I who work at school must do so immediately after returning to school.
太太所在的银行由于太多员工回中国过年，基于安全的考虑也要求所有中国返新员工遵守缺席假规程。
The wife's bank is also requiring all returning Chinese employees to abide by absentee leave rules due to safety concerns as too many staff return to China for the Chinese New Year.
新加坡政府为申请缺席假的员工向公司补贴每人每日100元新币（约合人民币500元），以减小公司损失。
The Singapore government subsidises companies with 100 new yuan (about 500 yuan) a day for employees who apply for absentee leave to minimise company losses.
于是我们一家三口在向公司学校汇报确认后，都开始了在家14天自我隔离的体验。
So the three of us started our 14-day self-segregation at home after reporting the confirmation to our school.
幸好最初的缺席假只规定减少不必要的外出，并不绝对禁止外出。
Fortunately, the initial absence only provided for a reduction in unnecessary absences and did not absolutely prohibit travel.
天一亮，我们第一件事情就是赶到超市，采购了很多食材和生活用品补充空空如也的家庭物资储备。
The first thing we did at daybreak was to get to the supermarket and buy lots of ingredients and supplies to replenish the empty stock of household goods.
当时超市内货源充足，人很少，戴口罩的人更是见不到几个。
At the time, the supermarket was well stocked with few people, not to mention a few wearing masks.
这些加上在机场的所见，让我们初次体验了新加坡与中国不同的应对疫情方式。
Taken together with what we saw at the airport, it was our first experience of how Singapore responded to the epidemic differently from China.
居家隔离14天，疫情愈来愈严重在家隔离期间，生活上倒没有什么影响，工作也可以上网做，最难熬的倒是我家小朋友。
Home isolation for 14 days, the increasing severity of the epidemic in the home isolation period, life has little impact, work can also be done online, the most difficult is my children.
平时我们家的带娃风格就是常常带着外出，周末两天几乎都是早出晚归在外面玩得嗨。
Usually we take the baby style is often take out, weekend two days almost early come back to play outside Hi.
她打自有记忆以来就从未那么久不出门的，非常不习惯。
She had never been out of the house so long since she had remembered, and she was not used to it.
因此，一开始家里的这只小“神兽”时不时发点小脾气，要求我们陪她玩，隔三岔五还嚷嚷着要“陪爸爸妈妈”去楼下转转。
So at first the little beast in the family was a little grumpy and asked us to play with her, and he kept shouting "Go hang out with Mom and Dad" downstairs.
这些天，我们夫妇把家里囤积的玩具玩了个遍，实在娃忍不住会乘人稀少的时候在家附近转上一会。
These days, we play around the hoard of toys, so we can't help taking a short walk around the house when people are scarce.
之前不怎么看动画片的娃还养成了每天晚上八点看上半小时的作息习惯。
Those who didn't watch animated cartoons developed the habit of watching it for half an hour at eight every night.
小朋友学习能力非常强大，14天不到，用手机点看视频玩得遛遛的，还会突然用遥控器关掉老爸老妈看的起劲的电视节目，以求得关注。
Children's learning ability is very strong, 14 days less than the point of view of video stroll, will suddenly use the remote control to turn off dad's mother to watch the exciting television program, for attention.
随着中国之后患者人数的大量增长，新加坡出现更多的输入患者，新加坡针对疫情的政策渐渐紧了：我回来后没几天，缺席隔离令就强制推广至所有公司。
As the number of patients increased significantly after China and more patients were brought in, Singapore's response to the epidemic became tighter: a few days after my return, the absence order was made mandatory for all companies.
2月7日，在我居家隔离第12天的时候，由于新加坡开始出现最近未出过国的本地公民感染新冠肺炎，新加坡将疾病暴发应对系统应对级别从黄色调高至橙色，开始禁止最近14天去过中国的普通访客入境（新加坡公民和在新长期工作者例外）。
On February 7, when I was in home quarantine for 12 days, Singapore raised its disease response level from yellow to orange as Singapore began to develop new crown pneumonia among local citizens who had not recently left the country, and began banning ordinary visitors who had been to China in the last 14 days (except for Singaporean citizens and new permanent workers).
新加坡民众一时间紧张起来，超市出现了抢购人潮，货架上生活必需品被一扫而光。
Singaporeans have been nervous for a while, with shoppers snapping up at supermarkets and their shelves emptied of necessities.
好在“恐慌式”的抢购只持续了一两天，随着生活物资迅速补充而迅速平息。
The good news is that the panic buying lasted only a day or two and subsided quickly as supplies were quickly replenished.
与此同时，各方对于防控疫情更加严格。
At the same time, the parties to control the epidemic more stringent.
就拿居家隔离来说，我因回来的早，这十几天是没人来检查的，全靠自觉。
Take the home isolation, I came back early, the last ten days are not examined by anyone, rely on self-awareness.
比我晚到新1周的隔离人士则会每天早晚两次收到人力资源部的短信，必须立即回复以确认位置，判定是否在家隔离。
Separators who arrive a week later receive a text message from HR twice a day, and must respond immediately to confirm their location and decide whether to stay at home.
到2月14日，政策又进一步严格，所有居家隔离人士被禁止离家，会由政府安排的人员提供生活必需品。
By 14 February, the policy was further tightened, with all persons living in isolation prohibited from leaving their homes and provided with necessities by Government-arranged personnel.
新加坡2月中旬规定，从中国入境人员必须居家隔离14天，其间不得外出确诊人数日渐增加，我却选择摘下口罩生活我家解除隔离后，小朋友欢欢喜喜回幼儿园，我也照常去公司上班，太太公司则选择分流上班，一周去公司，一周在家办公。
Singapore in mid-February, the number of people from China must stay in isolation for 14 days, the increasing number of people have to be diagnosed, but I chose to take off my mask and live in the home.
一开始我还戴着口罩出门，但是两个星期后渐渐放弃了。
At first I went out wearing a mask, but after two weeks I gave up.
一方面，外面戴口罩的人不多。
On the one hand, not many people wear masks outside.
我每天通勤单程要1小时，公交换地铁。
I commute one way every day for an hour and commute to the subway.
据我目测车上乘客戴口罩的比率平均只有1/3左右。
On average, only about a third of my passengers wear face masks, according to my visual survey.
车厢照例拥挤，乘客间贴得很近。
The carriages were usually crowded and the passengers were close to each other.
偶尔听到一两声咳嗽，我起先心里难免会有一些疑虑，也有看到有乘客循声而视，却没有任何人有避开的动作。
Occasionally I heard a cough or two, and at first I had some misgivings about it. I also saw passengers looking back, but no one seemed to avoid it.
另一方面，戴口罩时间长了，反倒有呼吸不适，喉咙干燥的感觉。
On the other hand, wearing a mask for a long time, instead of breathing discomfort, dry throat feeling.
想要咳嗽，但众目睽睽之下又怕引起不必要的误会。
Want to cough, but the public under the eyes of the fear of causing unnecessary misunderstanding.
时间一久，憋得难受，心跳也不由得更快，人的心理不由得起了微妙的变化，会忧虑自己是否中招了，越想就越不舒服。
Time, pent up uncomfortable, the heartbeat can not help but faster, people's psychology can not help subtlety changes, will worry about whether they admitted, the more uncomfortable they think.
找机会趁人不注意退下口罩，猛地呼吸几口无过滤的空气，顿时舒畅无比，不适“症状”也烟消云散。
Find the opportunity to take advantage of people do not take off the mask, breathing a few unfiltered air, immediately comfortable incomparable, uncomfortable "symptoms" also dissipated.
这么几次下来，我就果断放弃了戴口罩。
Several times down the line, I decided to give up wearing a mask.
至于女儿就更不乐意了，往往刚给她戴上，小手儿立马就褪下来。
As for her daughter is even more reluctant, often just put on to her, the small hands immediately fade.
我心也大，根据确诊记录中婴幼儿患者比率极低，且婴幼儿自愈能力较成人强的信息，索性不戴就不戴吧。
My heart is also large, according to the confirmed records of infants and young children with very low rates of self-healing ability than adults, simply do not wear it.
看到这里，难免有朋友会责怪我“佛系”。
Seeing here, it is inevitable that some friends will blame me for "Buddhism."
正巧新加坡的防疫政策也被很多国内的朋友诟病为“佛系”。
At the same time, Singapore's immunization policy has been criticized by many domestic friends as "Buddhism."
这最早和新加坡总理李显龙2月8日对公众关于疫情措施的讲话有关。
This is the first Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong February 8 to the public on measures to address the epidemic.
李显龙在讲话中提到：“如果确诊人数持续攀升，进行密切接触者的追踪也将无济于事，若继续让所有可疑病例住院和接受隔离，医院将应付不来。
"If the number of people diagnosed continues to rise, tracing by close contacts will not help, and hospitals will not be able to cope if all suspicious cases continue to be hospitalized and quarantined," Mr Lee said in his speech.
一旦出现这种情况，而新冠病毒的死亡率维持在一般流感的低水平，政府将鼓励只出现轻微症状的人去看家庭医生，在家休养。
In the event that this occurs and the death rate of the new cap virus remains at a low level of ordinary influenza, the Government will encourage people with only mild symptoms to see a family doctor and stay at home.
只有年长者、孩童和有其他并发症的人得入院，以便集中医疗资源。
Only the elderly, children and those with other complications are hospitalized in order to pool medical resources.
”李显龙告知民众正确面对疫情另外，政府应对口罩缺货，所宣传的预防传播最有效的方法是保持良好的个人卫生习惯，即勤洗手、避免用手触摸脸部。
"Lee told people to face the epidemic correctly. In addition, the government should be out of stock of masks, and the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease is to maintain good personal hygiene practices, i.e. wash hands frequently and avoid touching the face by hand.
若有咳嗽或流鼻涕等呼吸道疾病症状，才需要戴口罩。
Wear a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms such as cough or runny nose.
光看这段文字，包括我本人在内、经历了中国国内严格的隔离控制阵仗的人们自然会有担忧。
Looking at this text alone, people, including myself, who have experienced China's strict isolation and control of the fighting will naturally be worried.
但经过更多的了解，我感到新加坡如此“宽控”的背后，有着非常细致的考量。
But as I have learned more, I feel that behind Singapore's "leniency," there are very careful considerations.
首先科学研究发现冠状肺炎病毒不耐高温高湿的环境。
First of all scientific research found that coronary pneumonia virus resistant to high temperature and high humidity environment.
新加坡常年温度30度以上，湿度更是达80%-90%。
Singapore has a constant temperature of more than 30 degrees and humidity of 80% -90%.
病毒的活性因此大大减弱，传播危害性较国内冬季环境低了许多。
As a result, virus activity has been significantly reduced and transmission is much less harmful than in the domestic winter environment.
这是新加坡“宽松”政策的首要前提。
This is the primary premise of Singapore's "easing" policy.
再者，病毒目前还没有有效的治疗方法。
Moreover, there is currently no effective treatment for the virus.
所谓治愈主要是靠个人的抗体来杀灭病毒。
The so-called cure depends mainly on individual antibodies to kill the virus.
医院的有效治疗手段主要是帮助特定弱体质人群控制病毒影响的其他并发症状。
The effective treatment of hospital is mainly to help specific weak population to control the impact of the virus other complications.
所以，让症状轻微的患者和疑似患者在家隔离，通过与医院密切联络及时反馈，效果也不会有什么差别。
So, let the patient with mild symptoms and suspected patients at home isolation, through close contact with the hospital timely feedback, the effect will not be any different.
新加坡人以遵纪守法闻名，绝多数人也不会在隔离期到处乱跑传播病毒，这点也还是信得过的。
Singaporeans are known for being law-abiding, and most people do not travel around during quarantine periods to spread the virus, which is quite believable.
新加坡就医本就有二级体制，生小病都去私人小诊所，要去大医院，除急症外，也要先通过私人诊所医生预约才能成行。
Singapore has a two-tier system in place to treat minor ailments in private small clinics and to go to major hospitals. In addition to emergency cases, medical appointments in private clinics are required.
这样有效缓解了大医院的资源紧张问题。
This effectively alleviates the resource constraints of the big hospitals.
在特别疫情下，这个体制当得到维护，以保证有效医疗资源最有效地使用。
In exceptional cases, the system should be maintained to ensure the most efficient use of effective medical resources.
这也是“不接收轻微病人”的原因所在。
This is why "light patients are not admitted."
至于不“鼓励”戴口罩，倒是个无奈之举。
As for not "encourage" wearing masks, but is a helpless.
当前市场上口罩确实非常紧缺，只能优先供应医务工作者。
There is a real shortage of face masks on the market and priority must be given to medical workers.
在2月初，新加坡政府曾通过多渠道收集，给每户居民派发了4个口罩，共500多万个，也算尽了点本分，但依然杯水车薪。
In early February, the government did its part by distributing more than five million masks to each household through a multi-channel collection.
新加坡政府发放的口罩上面写明：健康人不需要戴口罩有趣的是，2月18日新加坡贸工部长陈振声和中华总商会的内部会议中曾私下就此事吐槽：有居民问我，“我一家五口人，四个口罩不够用怎么办？”陈回答说，“生病了才用。
Interestingly, Chen Zhensheng, Singapore's minister of trade and industry, and an internal meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Singapore on February 18 privately complained: "My family of five, four masks are not enough?" Chen replied.
”继续问，“五个人同时病了怎么办？”陈说，“那就全家送入医院治疗隔离，都不需要用到你家那四个口罩了。
"What if five people get sick at the same time?" Chen said. "The family is sent to a hospital for isolation, and you don't need your four masks.
”吐槽归吐槽，会意一笑了之。
"Slot back to the slot, will mean to laugh.
但陈部长指出，即使有数千万的口罩，也是远远不够用，应当优先使医护人员得到保障。
But Chen pointed out that even if there are tens of millions of masks, it is far from enough, and priority should be given to ensuring that medical personnel are protected.
国人应当保持冷静，理性渡过难关，并且还要考虑得更长远一些，要对之后可能的经济难关进行应对。
Chinese people should keep calm, reason through the difficulties, but also think longer term, to deal with possible economic difficulties later.
这说的其实都是大实话。
It's all very true.
其实，新加坡防疫治疗工作还是非常细致负责的。
In fact, Singapore's epidemic prevention work is very meticulous and responsible.
卫生部会对每位确诊病例的传播史都进行详细的排查，如何感染，接触了哪些人群，去过哪些地方都要试图搞清楚，并且尽可能联络上所有病患密切接触过的人，安排他们的隔离，检查措施。
The Ministry of Health conducts a detailed screening of the history of transmission of each confirmed case, how it is infected, who it has contacted and where it has tried to find out and, as far as possible, contact all persons with whom the patient is in close contact, arrange for their isolation and check-up.
相关资讯公众都可以在新加坡卫生部的网站上查询到，让大家及时确切地了解到疫情的发展情况。
The general public can check the website of the Ministry of Health of Singapore for more information on the development of the epidemic.
这些细致的工作不怎么为国外媒体所报道，却是保障新加坡疫情安全可控的重要措施。
These meticulous efforts are not reported by the foreign media, but are an important measure to keep the epidemic under control in Singapore.
新加坡国家传染病中心（NCID）负责收治确诊病例时至今日，中国国内的疫情俨然已经渐渐顺利进入下半场，但疫情在世界很多国家大面积暴发，新加坡的确诊病例也随之猛升至212人（3月14日数据），形势依然严峻。
Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) is handling confirmed casesThe situation in China is now moving smoothly into the second half of the year. However, with widespread outbreaks in many countries around the world, the number of confirmed cases in Singapore has soared to 212 (March 14).
而我一家在新加坡的日常生活依旧安稳地继续着，似乎也没有受什么大的影响。
My family's day-to-day life in Singapore continued undisturbed and seemed unaffected.
现在我还时常回想起在上海时一家三口坐在公交车上的一段经历：彼时全国疫情刚刚开始，气氛有点小紧张，但女儿在车上依然天真无邪地哼起“what a wonderful world”（何为精彩世界）的歌。
Now I often recall my family's experience of sitting on a bus in Shanghai when the national epidemic was just beginning and the atmosphere was a bit tense, but my daughter was still humming innocently "What a Wonderful World" in the car.
我想起自己一边聆听稚音，一边望着窗外夜景的情景，感慨万分。
I think of myself listening to the childish, while looking out of the window at the scene of the night, feeling great.
小娃娃可以不问世事，无忧无虑，但我们成人能够在困难时期依然生活安稳实为不易，要感谢很多人幕后悉心的付出。
Dolls can come out of the world and be carefree, but it's not easy for us adults to be able to live comfortably in difficult times, thanks to the dedication of many people behind the scenes.
正是有了这些周到的考量和细致具体的措施，让像我一样生活在新加坡的人，能够尽可能以以往正常的生活方式，安心地面对疫情。
It is thanks to these thoughtful considerations and meticulous and concrete measures that people like me living in Singapore have been able to face the epidemic with as much peace of mind as possible in their normal way of life.
我觉得新加坡疫情依旧是乐观可控，有信心可以安然渡过难关。
I think the Singapore epidemic is still under control and I am confident that we can survive.
