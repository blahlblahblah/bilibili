燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 凌远川疫情之下，很多创业者发现，人的问题才是眼下最难处理的。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Under the circumstances of Lingyuanchuan, the founder and former founder of Fujian Finance, many entrepreneurs find the human problem the hardest to deal with right now.
为了帮助创业者看清局面、应对危机，2月21日，燃财经举办“创新经济战疫计划” 第四期线上沙龙，主题聚焦人事招聘行业。
To help entrepreneurs understand the situation and cope with the crisis, on February 21, we hosted the "Innovation Economic Plague Program" Phase IV Online Salon, which focused on the recruitment industry.
智联招聘CEO郭盛做了《疫情之下，企业如何招人用人》的分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了在线对话。
Chile recruitment CEO Guo Shengsheng did "under the epidemic, how companies hire people" sharing, and with the chief financial editor He Shu-long did online dialogue.
•今年有17%的人放弃跳槽，简历投递量下滑了70%-80%；•看到疫情就去安排裁员或者降薪是过激反应，企业应该做长线安排，看到不确定性背后的东西；•降薪调整要从老板自己做起，不要让员工成为疫情的背锅侠，现在其实是储备人才的好时机；•有IT、产品、程序等经验求职者的工资涨幅要高于普通求职者，建议普通求职者掌握新技能，对职业重新定位；•视频本身是一个风口，但视频面试未必是风口。
:: 17% give up job-hopping this year, and resume delivery is down 70% -80%; companies should make long-term arrangements to see what's behind the uncertainty.
在未来，面试一定还是视频和线下相结合的状态；•从美股退市以后，智联招聘希望能够重启国内资本市场计划，并对国内的资本市场抱有很大信心。
In the future, interviews will have to be a combination of video and offline; after withdrawing from US shares, Juniors is hoping to revive domestic capital-market plans and have a lot of faith in domestic capital markets.
疫情下的人才市场整体惨淡外卖、教育、法律行业逆势增长我认为整体的人才市场压力还是很大的。
The overall human resources market under the epidemic situation bleak take-out, education, legal industry countertrend growth I think the overall pressure on the talent market is still very strong.
从企业端来看，实行裁员的企业数量高于积极招人的企业数量，裁员的企业数已经占到了30%以上，但仍在积极招人的企业只占20%-25%。
On the corporate side, the number of companies laying off workers is higher than the number of active recruiters, with more than 30 per cent of them laying off workers, but only 20 to 25 per cent of those still actively recruiting.
往年，春节之后应该是一个非常旺盛的求职季，但现在情况完全变了，大概有17%的人放弃了跳槽，简历投递量下滑了70%-80%。
In previous years, Spring Festival was supposed to be a very busy job-hunting season, but things have changed altogether, with about 17 percent of respondents quitting their jobs and resumes dropping 70 percent to 80 percent.
我有一个朋友是做人力资源外包的，以前他在过完春节以后都很痛苦，因为很多人跳槽，他要重新更新数据，成本巨高。
I have a friend who outsources human resources. He used to be very miserable after the Spring Festival because a lot of people change jobs.
现在他看到企业不敢裁员、求职者也不敢跳槽，整个招聘市场相对来说比较冷清。
Now he sees enterprises dare not lay off workers, job seekers do not dare to change jobs, the entire recruitment market is relatively lonely.
但是市场内也不全是坏消息，有一些行业还是做得特别好的，存在一些亮点。
But the market is not all bad news, there are some industries or do particularly well, there are some bright spots.
尤其是在复工后第一周，能看到一些行业在逆势成长，比如平台型的餐饮企业，像美团、饿了么以及KFC等生意非常好，这类企业在大量招收送餐人员。
Especially in the first week after the resumption of work, you can see that some industries are growing against the trend, such as the platform-style catering enterprises, such as the U. S. Mission, hungry and KFC very good business, such as the large number of catering personnel in such enterprises.
还有就是教育培训企业，特别是线上教育培训企业，招人需求也非常旺盛，对技术人员和销售人员都有非常大的需求，我相信这个行业也一定是在疫情当中收益巨大的行业。
There is also a very strong demand for education and training enterprises, especially online education and training enterprises. There is a great demand for technicians and salespeople. I believe this industry must also be a lucrative business in the midst of the epidemic.
还有一些大家意想不到的行业，招人需求也非常高。
There are also some unexpected industries, recruitment needs are also very high.
在疫情的冲击下，企业的法律纠纷和人力资源纠纷开始变多，对法律方面的专业人士和中介机构的需求增加。
Under the impact of the epidemic, legal disputes and human resources disputes in enterprises began to become more and more, the demand for legal professionals and intermediary institutions increased.
房地产是一个正在积极蓄水的行业。
Real estate is an industry that is actively storing water.
我想房地产商可能已经看到了，在淡季之后会迅速迎来旺季，所以他们在提前做好人员储备，当然这跟目前很多贷款政策出现的放松也有关系。
I think real estate companies may have seen a quick start to the boom after the off-season, so they're building up staff reserves ahead of schedule, which has to do with the loosening of a lot of lending policies.
降薪调整要从老板自己做起现在其实是储备人才的好时机最近很多新闻报道都在说企业裁员，裁员过程中也出现了很多纠纷。
Pay cuts start with the boss himself. Now is a good time to hoard talent. There's been a lot of news lately about layoffs and a lot of controversy around the process.
在这种特殊的时间点上，企业如何进行人力资源管理成了当务之急。
At this particular point in time, how to manage human resources has become an urgent matter.
首先，现在各种法律法规十分严格，当你在做裁员的准备之前，一定要明确法律法规的要求。
First of all, laws and regulations are very strict. Before you make preparations to lay off workers, you must clarify the requirements of the laws and regulations.
其次，现在很多企业一说到活下去，第一个想到的就是裁员和降薪。
Second, now that many businesses talk about living, the first thing they think about is layoffs and pay cuts.
到底是先裁员还是先降薪，次序没关系，重要的是企业主要找到自己的初心和核心目的。
Whether to lay off workers first or reduce wages first, the order is irrelevant, the important thing is that the enterprise mainly finds its own initial and core purpose.
大部分员工其实都能够理解“共度时艰”这个概念，大家不愿意看到的是，所有的员工都在共度时艰，但是对老板自己没有任何影响。
Most employees understand the concept of "going through difficult times," and what they don't want to see is that all of them are having a difficult time together, but it doesn't have any effect on the boss himself.
我觉得正确的方法是告诉大家，员工痛，老板其实更痛。
I think the right way is to tell people that employees feel pain and bosses actually feel more pain.
然后无论做什么调整，都先从老板开始，让员工看到你的诚意，看到你确实是为了整个企业好、为了留下来的员工好，这就已经迈开了一大步。
Then whatever you do, start with the boss, show your sincerity, and take a big step forward when you see that you are really doing it for the good of the organization and for the sake of the employees who stay.
接下来对员工的各种安排，要好开展得多。
The following arrangements for the staff, to be carried out much better.
举个例子，我看到很多做得好的企业。
For example, I see a lot of good companies.
他们的老板自己先来上班，第一个复工。
Their boss came to work first and was the first to return to work.
老板对自己的薪酬降至少50%，甚至是零薪酬，还拿出股权激励或者期权激励跟大家分享。
The boss drops his salary by at least 50%, or even zero, with equity or option incentives to share.
另外，即使要求大家降薪，也承诺一旦企业恢复，一定会跟大家共享胜利成果，这样的沟通会让员工更容易接受。
And even if you ask for a pay cut, you promise to share the fruits of your success once the business recovers, and that communication will be more acceptable to employees.
在这个时候，我们往往能看到一个老板的经营理念和感召力，是否足以让企业降本增效并顺利度过危机。
At this time, we can often see a boss's business philosophy and charisma, whether it is enough to reduce cost efficiency and smooth the crisis.
还有一点需要提醒的是，其实在很多组织里面，或多或少都存在巨大的浪费现象。
Another caveat is that in many organizations, there is a greater or lesser degree of waste.
有些老白兔员工其实对企业的贡献没有那么大，在这个时候反而选择明哲保身、倚老卖老，不和企业共担风险，企业在这个时候应该慎重考量这些人。
Some of the old White Rabbit employees actually do not contribute so much to the enterprise, but at this time choose to protect themselves, rely on the old, do not share risks with enterprises, enterprises should carefully consider these people.
企业主也必须了解到，疫情之后，复工的时间可能比我们想象的都要快，很多行业会出现一些报复性反弹。
Entrepreneurs must also understand that, in the wake of the epidemic, it may take longer to get back to work than we thought, with some retaliatory rebound in many industries.
现在市场其实已经有了初步的恢复迹象，所以当我们在做很多准备工作要过冬的时候，一定要意识到春天很快就到了。
Now that the market is showing early signs of recovery, we must be aware that spring is fast approaching as we make a lot of preparations for the winter.
再提醒大家一点，现在我估计大家想的更多的是裁员而不是招聘，但实际上现在市场上有大量优秀的人才正在释放，你的企业如果预测到在未来会有一个比较大的增长，现在其实是储备人才的一个非常好的时机。
To remind you again, I think people are thinking more about layoffs than hiring, but there are a lot of talented people on the market right now, and your organization could be a great opportunity to hoard talent if it anticipates a big increase in the future.
眼下很多企业都在做调整，在裁员降薪、优化人员、调整架构的过程中，企业主也会犯一些错。
Companies are making adjustments, and employers are making mistakes in cutting salaries, optimizing staffing and restructuring.
第一个错误是，老板很焦虑，一焦虑就开始各种调整，会引起整个组织的焦虑。
The first is that the boss is anxious and starts to adjust as soon as he or she is anxious, causing anxiety throughout the organization.
原本船只是稍微进了一点水，结果船长一直在想办法把金银财宝往自己口袋里装，随时准备跳船。
The boat had been a little overboard, and the captain had been trying to carry the treasure in his pocket, ready to jump.
这种焦虑不断传递，就会让整只船失去方向。
The constant transmission of this anxiety can cause the ship to lose its orientation.
当企业主看见了困难要进行调整的时候，一定要有相当大的定力。
When the entrepreneur sees the difficulty to adjust, must have a considerable static force.
心里心急如焚，面上也要云淡风轻。
Hearts burning, the face of light clouds.
第二个错误是，发生险情后老板让员工成为背锅侠，没有对自己做任何处理。
The second mistake is, after the occurrence of dangerous situations, the boss let the staff become backpacker, do not do anything to their own.
员工会想，为什么老板的错误要让我们来承担，即便他离职了，也是心怀怨念地走。
Employees think, why the boss's mistake to let us bear, even if he left, but also with a grudge.
老板一定要先看到自己的问题。
The boss must see his own problems first.
第三个错误是，老板没有看到明天。
The third mistake was that the boss didn't see tomorrow.
大家都知道今天很艰难，但在这个过程当中，作为老板，一定要看到明天，想明白明天的情况。
Everyone knows it's tough today, but in the process, as a boss, be sure to see tomorrow and see what happens tomorrow.
应激反应往往是错误的反应，老板要看到不确定性背后的东西。
Stress is often the wrong response. Bosses need to see what's behind the uncertainty.
把现金流和利润分开不要做对短期现金流有伤害的事情这么长时间不开工，而且还是在旺季不开工，对企业的收入肯定会造成影响。
Separate cash flow from profits Don't do things that hurt short-term cash flow Don't start for so long and don't start during peak periods.
但智联的收入虽然受到影响，现金流还是非常健康的。
But even if its revenues were affected, the cash flow was very healthy.
这得益于我们内部关于工作效率、组织流程、运营效率方面，早就开始做提高。
This is due to our internal work efficiency, organizational processes, operating efficiency, early began to do.
对企业来说，如果是在短时间内才考虑到现金流健康的重要性，那将是非常危险的一件事情。
It would be very dangerous for companies to consider the importance of cash flow health only in the short term.
我们从去年就开始在现金流和产品的利润率方面做了很多工作。
We've been working on cash flow and profit margins since last year.
任何时候都尽量不要做应激反应，而是在很早以前把最坏的情况都考虑一遍，才能形成健康的组织。
Try not to react to stress at all times. Instead, consider the worst-case scenarios long before you form a healthy organization.
正是得益于去年我们就考虑了很多极端情况下会出现的问题，所以现在才会有比较好的局面。
Thanks to the fact that we considered a lot of extreme situations last year, we are now in a better position.
那么，如果过去没有考虑过，现在应该做哪些挽救措施来保证现金流的健康呢？首先，要把现金流和利润分开来，你的利润可以是负的，但现金流一定要是正的。
So, if you haven't thought about it before, what should you do now to keep your cash flow healthy? First, separate the cash flow from the profits, and your profits can be negative, but the cash flow must be positive.
在这个过程中，节流比开源还要重要。
In this process, throttling is more important than open source.
首先，把一些不必要的业务砍掉，把一些在未来不会带来很多效益的支出砍掉。
First, cut some unnecessary business and cut some expenses that won't bring many benefits in the future.
其次，房租和人工成本也是企业的大头。
Second, rents and labor costs are also the bulk of businesses.
人工方面，要选择战士。
Artificial aspect, must choose the warrior.
房租方面，一定要赶快去跟房东更新一次政府最新的政策，帮助自己节省现金。
For rent, be sure to update the latest government policy with your landlord to help you conserve cash.
最后就是社保和公积金，赶快派专人和当地的政府部门取得联系，没有专人也可以找中介机构，把这部分钱省下来。
Finally, the social security and provident fund, quickly send someone to contact the local government departments, no one can also find intermediaries, this money to save.
这几个措施就已经可以帮你省掉很多不必要的现金流支出，包括有一些广告能不打就不打，不要去做太多对短期现金流有伤害的事。
These steps can already save you a lot of unnecessary cash flow, including some ads that don't hit, don't do too much damage to short-term cash flow.
另外一个措施就是开源，现在大家都看到有很多贷款项可能比找投资更靠谱。
Another measure is open source, and now everyone sees that there are a lot of loans that may be more dependable than looking for investment.
往往在这个时候有很多中小企业的银行贷款会很大方的放出来。
Often in this time there are many small and medium-sized enterprises bank loans will be very generous to release.
很多中小企业其实帐面上有三个月的现金流，已经是相当不错了。
Many small and medium-sized enterprises actually have three months of cash flow on their books, is already quite good.
大部分中小企业顶多只有一到两个月的现金流。
Most SMEs have only one or two months of cash flow at most.
这样如果在今年三月份还没有大规模开始复工的话，这些企业就比较危险了。
That would make them more dangerous if work did not start on a large scale in March.
我在跟很多企业的接触过程当中，也确实看到有一些企业还是在打肿脸充胖子。
In the course of my contacts with many companies, I do see that some companies are still swollen and fat.
这个时候一定要关注现金流。
This is the time to focus on cash flow.
能够节约的地方就尽量节约，能够节省的开支就尽量节省。
Where economy is possible, economy is maximized, and economy is minimized where it can be achieved.
千万不要做第一个倒下去的人。
Never be the first to fall.
勇士比懒人重要员工比股东重要对于智联来说，和企业一起共度时艰是我们非常重要的要求。
Warriors are more important than lazy employees than shareholders. For Juniors, sharing tough times with companies is a very important requirement.
我们对中小企业有免费的招聘服务、产品延期消耗的服务，以及帮助企业减少成本的服务，比如税务、社保、灵活用工、劳动力外包等。
We offer free recruitment services to small and medium-sized enterprises, services that delay the consumption of products, and services that help businesses reduce costs, such as taxation, social security, flexible employment, and labor outsourcing.
其实各地都有各种各样的优惠政策，灵活运用这些政策也是一个很重要的工作，能为企业节省大量费用。
In fact, there are a variety of preferential policies, flexible application of these policies is also a very important work, enterprises can save a lot of costs.
当然，智联也推出了很多创新的无接触招聘产品，比如视频面试等。
Of course, Juniors has also launched a number of innovative, non-contact recruitment products, such as video interviews.
疫情对智联的招聘业务有比较大的影响，但好在智联有其他的业务早就开始布局，比如线上培训业务的增长非常快。
The epidemic has had a big impact on the recruitment business, but thanks to other Juniors' operations, such as online training, it has grown very fast.
另外智联会帮助企业做灵活用工、薪酬安排等工作，这些都是反周期业务，有非常大的提升。
In addition, think-tank will help enterprises to do flexible employment, remuneration arrangements and other jobs, these are counter-cyclical business, there has been a very large improvement.
这些反周期业务我们在两年前就开始考虑了。
We started thinking about these counter-cyclical operations two years ago.
我们当时就在想，如果有一天经济下滑，或者出现突发情况，我们一定要有一些反周期业务，这也是我们的一个核心逻辑。
We were thinking that if one day there was a downturn, or something sudden, we had to have some countercyclical business, and that was a core logic.
所以智联招聘现在内部都叫智联集团。
So the recruitment of Zhilian is now called internal think-tank group.
关于复工，我们全国有38个分公司，各地的政策都不一样，我们当然是希望早点复工，但复工又面临疫情防护等风险。
With regard to the resumption of work, we have 38 branches across the country with different policies. We certainly hope to get back to work early, but we face risks such as epidemic prevention.
经过讨论，我们认为不管当地的法律法规如何，员工的健康一定是第一位的，所以要在员工本人健康和物业大楼做了非常好的防范措施的情况下，才能复工。
After discussion, we believe that no matter what the local laws and regulations are, the health of the employees must be paramount, so that work can only resume if the employee's health and the property building have taken very good precautions.
在这个原则之下，我们的复工正在逐步开展，有条件的地方早一点，没有条件的地方可能晚一点。
Under this principle, our resumption of work is gradually under way, where conditions are earlier, where conditions may be delayed.
目前复工的状况基本上是30%-50%，多数员工还在家里办公。
At present, the return to work is essentially 30-50 per cent, with most employees still working from home.
集团内部也在进行组织调整。
Organizational adjustments are also taking place within the Group.
智联的一个核心价值观是“勇士比懒人重要”。
One of its core values is that "warriors are more important than idlers."
在疫情之下，我们看到大家的付出是不一样的，哪些是勇士、哪些是懒人，哪些组织要扩张、哪些组织要收缩，会分得比较清楚。
In the face of the epidemic, we are seeing that we are paying differently, and that we are better able to distinguish between those who are brave and those who are lazy, those who want to expand and those who want to contract.
在这个核心价值观指导之下，很多东西就比较容易执行了。
Guided by this core value, many things are easier to implement.
智联的第二个核心价值观就是，“员工比股东重要”。
The second core value of JFSU is that "employees matter more than shareholders."
如果我们的员工能够得到利益，他一定是在股东之前得到利益。
If our employees can get the benefit, they must get the benefit in advance of the shareholders.
如果因为疫情我们就去安排裁员或者降薪，我觉得这已经是过激反应了，在过激反应之下人往往会犯错误，还是应该要做一个长线的安排。
If we were to arrange layoffs or pay cuts because of the epidemic, I think that would be an overreaction, that people would make mistakes under extreme reactions, or that we should make a long-term arrangement.
对话郭盛：建议求职者掌握新技能一定要对职业重新定位燃财经：去年有不少企业裁员，今年开年又迎来了新的挑战，还有一批应届毕业生也开始求职，求职难的状况会不会进一步加剧？郭盛：虽然企业招人的需求没有那么旺盛，但还没有进入失业潮。
Last year, a lot of companies laid off workers, this year saw new challenges, and a number of fresh graduates began to apply for jobs. Will the job market get worse? Mr. Guo: Although the demand for jobs is not so strong, it hasn't yet entered the unemployment wave.
主要是因为中国年轻劳动力的供给在减少，中国的老龄化程度在加深。
Mainly because the supply of China's young workforce is shrinking, China's aging population is deepening.
像985、211的优秀毕业生，他们还是会有大量的企业去争抢。
Like 985, 211 excellent graduates, they will still have a large number of enterprises to grab.
更多的难题是在于一些普通院校甚至专科院校的学生。
The more difficult problem is that some ordinary schools and even college students.
他们学到的东西和社会还是比较脱节的，所以他没办法适应社会。
What they learn is still disjointed from society, so he can't adapt himself to society.
燃财经：你会给应届生求职者什么建议？郭盛：我给他们的建议是，首先，让自己脱颖而出，掌握一些技能。
What advice would you give to new job seekers? Guo Sheng: First of all, let yourself stand out from the crowd and master some skills.
据智联的薪酬调研报告，普通的、没有突出亮点的求职者，他今年工资同比去年的增长幅度只有5%。
The average, undistinguished job seeker has seen his salary rise this year by only 5 per cent year on year, according to a pay survey by the think tank.
但是对于一些有技能的，比如说有IT、产品、程序等经验的人才，工资涨幅可以达到10%-15%。
But for skilled workers, such as those with experience in IT, products or programs, wages can rise by as much as 10% to 15%.
如果你能够在毕业时就练就一些技能，对你的人生会有很大的帮助。
If you can develop some skills by the time you graduate, it will be of great help in your life.
其次，除了努力寻找机会，更重要的是找到适合自己、匹配自己的机会。
Second, rather than trying to look for opportunities, it is more important to find opportunities that suit you and match yourself.
以前大家都是海投简历，现在应该用深钻洞的方式，想办法对自己特别感兴趣的行业和企业做研究调查，培养自己在这方面的认知能力和人脉，然后想办法在这个行业的职位里找到钻石。
The time has come to dig deep into your resume, find ways to research industries and businesses of particular interest to you, develop your cognitive and networking skills, and find ways to find diamonds in jobs in the industry.
燃财经：是不是在未来的一段时间里，所有的求职者都需要调低预期、重新对职业做定位？郭盛：国内有很多新兴的职业出来，就有很多职业会被淘汰，所以一定要对职业重新定位。
Caijing: Is it necessary for all job seekers to lower their expectations and reorient their careers for some time to come.Guo Sheng: There are a lot of new jobs coming out of the country, and there are a lot of occupations that will be eliminated, so you have to reposition yourself.
比如很多记者现在变成自媒体记者，也算是一种重新定位。
For example, many journalists are now self-media journalists, which is a repositioning.
只有这样才能与时俱进，在这个社会上立于不败之地。
Only in this way can we keep pace with the times and remain invincible in this society.
调低预期取决于你的预期是什么，是钱还是职业中的成长和学习，以及这个预期是长期还是短期，三个月内预期肯定是要调低，但如果你预期的维度是三年，那其实只要你在合适的赛道上，就完全不用那么绝望。
Lowering expectations depends on what you expect, whether it's money or growth and learning in your career, and whether it's long-term or short-term, with expectations definitely going down in three months, but if you expect a three-year horizon, it really doesn't have to be desperate if you're on the right track.
我觉得这个社会对所有人都是公平的，关键是未来你在哪一个赛道上，以及你在这个赛道上愿意跑多久、跑多辛苦。
I think the society is fair to everyone. The key is which track you are on in the future and how long and hard you are willing to run on the track.
举我身边的一个例子，他是我的同学，我们从商学院毕业的时候，大家都在做投资、做咨询，工资都特别高。
As an example, he was one of my classmates. When we graduated from business school, everyone was investing, consulting, and making extremely high salaries.
只有他学业非常出色，背景也非常好，却跑去了一个印度的钢铁公司。
Only he excelled at his studies and came from a very good background, but went to an Indian steel company.
我们就问他，你为什么去这个钢铁公司，他说这个公司谁都不会去，所以我在那里就是一个特别厉害的人，最后他成了这家公司的CEO，现在这家公司是全球最大的钢铁公司了——塔塔钢铁。
We asked him why you went to this steel company and he said no one would go, so I was such a tough guy there that he ended up as CEO of the company, which is now Tata Steel, the world's largest steel company.
视频面试未必是风口面试一定是视频和线下互相结合燃财经：视频面试最近十分火热，你觉得这会是一个长期的“风口”吗？郭盛：视频本身是一个风口，但是视频面试未必是风口。
Video Interview is not necessarily a wind interview It must be a combination of video and offline combustible finance: Do you think this is going to be a long-term "wind tunnel" recently? Guo Sheng: Video itself is a bellwether, but a video interview is not necessarily a windpipe.
在视频上，大家看到的很多信息是不完整不全面的，但企业通过视频进行面试，肯定还是希望了解求职者，而且有非常强的互动，希望知道求职者和企业有没有非常好的化学反应。
In the video, you see a lot of information is incomplete and incomplete, but enterprises through video interviews, must still want to know about job-seekers, and there is a very strong interaction, want to know whether there is a very good chemical reaction between the job-seeker and the enterprise.
视频面试由于是远程，很多丰富的信息可能就无法捕捉了。
Because video interviews are remote, a lot of rich information may not be captured.
所以我觉得这个是对视频面试的一个非常巨大的阻挠。
So I think this is a very big hindrance to the video interview.
现在在无接触的情况下面试，企业没有选择，只能做视频面试。
Now in the absence of contact interview, enterprises have no choice but to do video interviews.
所以我觉得视频本身是一个长期的风口，而面试本身是一个传统行业。
So I think the video itself is a long-term air vent, and the interview itself is a traditional industry.
在未来，面试一定还是视频和线下互相结合的状态。
In the future, the interview must be a combination of video and offline state.
燃财经：很多人不愿意线上面试，有什么好的办法吗？如果初试通过视频面试，后面的面试还需要面对面吗？郭盛：如果求职者都不愿意答应你线上面试的请求，那基本上这个人对你的公司兴趣不大。
If you pass a video interview for the first time, do you need to face each other in the interviewGuo Sheng: If you are not willing to agree to an online interview request, that person will have little interest in your company.
如果是初级岗位，那么直接pass掉就可以了。
If it's an entry-level position, then just drop the pass.
如果是高级岗位，可能还要通过其他方法跟他联系，帮他摆脱线上沟通的心理障碍。
If he is in a senior position, he may also be contacted in other ways to help him get rid of the psychological barriers to online communication.
一些标准的技能如财务会计，在线上面试完全没问题。
Some standard skills, such as financial accounting, are perfectly fine for online interviews.
但对于那些职位要求比较高的、跟组织文化相关性比较高的职位，面对面的面试甚至群面都是非常有必要的。
But face-to-face interviews and even groups are necessary for positions that are more demanding and culturally relevant to the organization.
燃财经：你们会将海纳、赛码这样的专业线上面试（笔试）提供商，以及Zoom、小鱼易连这样的远程会议软件看成是竞品吗？与它们相比，智联有哪些优劣势？郭盛：我觉得不算是竞品，他们更多是视频工具的供应商，而不一定是面试工具的供应商。
What are the strengths and weaknesses of Juniors compared to the professional online interview (written test) providers such as Heiner and Symantec, as well as remote conferencing software such as Zoom and Fisher? Guo Sheng: I don't think they are competitive, they are more suppliers of video tools than interview tools.
所以我们的强处未必是在视频，而是在于面试和人力资源领域。
So our strengths are not necessarily in video, but in interviewing and human resources.
用户和客户的需求依然是最重要的事目光放长远疫情终将过去燃财经：在线招聘虽然是个老行业，但新模式和新玩家也在陆续涌现出来，最近几年感受到哪些竞争压力？如何应对？郭盛：这个不确定性包括宏观经济环境的变化、国内跳槽频率由高转低的变化、移动互联网的红利消失，这些都会带来很多压力。
Look to the long term and it will eventually burn finance: While online recruitment is an old business, new models and players are springing up, what competitive pressures have emerged in recent years, and how to deal with them.Guo Sheng: This uncertainty includes changes in the macro-economic environment, changes in domestic job-hopping frequency from high to low, and the disappearance of dividends from mobile internet.
怎样在这个过程中得到更多用户，也是我们面临的一个主要课题。
How to get more users in this process is also a major problem we face.
但不管环境如何变化，不变的是去看用户需求，看哪些新技术比较容易跑出来，看组织的能力怎么锻炼。
But no matter how the environment changes, the constant is to see what new technologies are easier to come out of and how well the organization works.
没有一个企业有一劳永逸的应对方法，最核心的还是抓住用户和客户的需求，没有他们就没有我们，这是最重要的一件事。
No company has a one-size-fits-all approach, the core is to capture the needs of users and customers, without them we are not the most important thing.
燃财经：去年以来，有关部门对大数据相关行业进行了整顿，有一些“买卖”简历的公司被查处了。
Flaming Finance: Since last year, authorities have overhauled big data-related industries, and some companies that buy and sell CVs have been dealt with.
你认为这波整治的原因是什么？对行业带来了哪些影响？郭盛：“买卖”简历这样的灰色交易对行业的负面影响是非常巨大的，但是一些企业甚至很多黑客还是会去偷偷做这样的生意，对于用户的隐私保护非常不利。
What do you think are the reasons for this wave of regulation and what has been the impact on the industryGuo Sheng: The negative impact of grey transactions such as buying and selling CVs is enormous, but some companies and even a lot of hackers will secretly do such a business, which is very detrimental to the privacy protection of users.
对这些企业进行惩处是一件好事，这可以保持行业的健康性。
Punishing these companies is a good thing, and it keeps the industry healthy.
以前我们要告这样的做简历买卖的公司还要去做各种各样的举证，去推翻这种无罪推论。
