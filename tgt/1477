本报记者 郝嘉奇 郝成 北京报道一家环保企业复工需要八个单位盖章，此事在网上引起争议。
This newspaper reporter Hao Jiacheng Beijing reported that an environmental protection enterprise needs eight units to seal, this matter caused controversy on the Internet.
2月12日，中七建工集团华贸有限公司提交了复工申请表，并在四川省泸州市江阳区新型冠状肺炎疫情防控指挥部的要求下，由八个单位盖章审批后复工。
On February 12, S7 Construction Industry Group China Trade Co., Ltd. submitted the application form for resumption of work, and at the request of the New Coronal Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command of Jiangyang District, Luzhou, Sichuan Province, eight units sealed and approved and resumed work.
网传的《复工申请表》显示，该公司申请复工理由为“江阳区主城区雨污分流改造项目属于泸州市委政府重大民生工程，环保工程，加之工期紧，任务重”。
According to the rework application form, the company's reason for returning to work was that "the main urban area of Jiangyang District rain and pollution diversion renovation project belongs to Luzhou Municipal Government major livelihood projects, environmental protection projects, coupled with tight deadlines and heavy tasks."
下方，有属地镇街（园区）、区应急管理部门、区生态环境部门、区卫生健康部门、区政府分管领导、区防疫指挥部等八个单位签字盖章同意。
Below, there are territory town street (park), district emergency management departments, district ecological environment departments, district health departments, district government departments, district epidemic prevention command and other eight units signed and sealed the agreement.
审签备案程序已取消2月17日下午，《中国经营报》记者联系到江阳区应急管理局，工作人员表示，之前确实需要审核，但这家企业复工一天内就完成审核了，也没有等待太久。
On the afternoon of Feb. 17, the China Business Administration contacted the Jiangyang Emergency Management Bureau and officials said they needed to review the case before, but the company returned to work within a day, and did not wait long.
记者也联系到在复工表上签字的泸州市江阳生态环境局蒋永强。
The reporter also contacted in the resumption of work form signed by the Luzhou Jiangyang Ecological Environment Bureau Jiang Yongqiang.
他告诉记者：“我们相关工作根据指挥部安排，具体有什么需要了解的请致电江阳区疫情防控指挥部。
He told reporters: "We work in accordance with the command arrangements, specific needs to know please call the Jiangyang epidemic prevention and control command.
”指挥部办公室工作人员证实，根据之前的通知，环保企业复工确实需要盖章，每个行业不一样，环保企业需要盖八个章，但政策会有一些调整，企业不着急复工的话可以等等。
Officials at the command office confirmed that environmental companies do need to be stamped if they are to go back to work. Every industry is different, and environmental companies need to cover eight chapters, but there will be some policy changes and companies can wait if they don't hurry to get back to work.
江阳区委宣传部账号“江阳发布”17日发布此事情况说明：政府部门是通过全程代办的方式对该公司复工完成审签的。
Jiangyang District publicity department account "Jiangyang issued" 17 the issue of this fact note: government departments through the whole process of the company to resume work to complete the audit.
随着疫情形势的好转，已取消审签备案程序，并努力为企业复工复产做好服务。
With the improvement of the epidemic situation, the examination and filing procedures have been cancelled, and efforts have been made to re-establish good services for enterprises.
对此，有舆论认为疫情防控还在关键时期，对复工严格把关，肯定是必要的。
In this regard, there is public opinion that the prevention and control of the epidemic is still in a critical period, strict inspection of the resumption of work, is certainly necessary.
但让那么多部门盖章同意，有点过分了。
But to have so many departments seal it is a bit too much.
舆情观察员@嘉善老顾 说，政府要做的，一是帮助企业解决疫情防控必须的物资，二是派人下沉到企业，给企业实实在在的指导，让给企业的承诺能够真正落地，而不是一纸空文。
'What the government needs to do is help businesses with the materials they need to prevent and control the epidemic, and send people down to companies, give them real guidance and make sure their commitments are real, 'he said.
在接受记者采访时，暨南大学副教授、广东省安全生产应急专家卢文刚说，在安全生产领域，如果没有发生疫情，环保企业每年节后复工本就是需要多部门审批的，而从2月10日江阳区已有7例新冠肺炎确诊病例的严峻形势看，因为疫情防控还在关键时期，审签备案在当时是必要的。
In an interview with reporters, Lu Wengang, an associate professor at Jinan University and an emergency expert on production safety in Guangdong province, said that environmental protection companies would have needed multi-agency approval to resume work each year if there had not been an epidemic.
他还分析，从这张复工表来看，基层政府是严格规范履行程序的。
He also analyzed, from this resume, that the grass-roots government is strictly standardized to carry out the procedures.
而多个单位签字盖章，是目前全国层面的安全生产和应急管理监管“九龙治水”和“铁路警察各管一段”的体制所决定的，不能在此疫情防控形势下苛责这样一个履行属地管理责任的基层政府。
With the signature and seal of many units, it is decided by the system of supervision of production safety and emergency management at the national level.
此外，当地复工复产审签备案的效率是值得肯定的。
In addition, the local resumption of work inspection and record-keeping efficiency is positive.
卢文刚说：“2月12日，该公司按照联合工作组指导意见落实疫情防控措施后，于当日下午5时许提出复工申请。
"On February 12, the company, in accordance with the guidance of the Joint Working Group to implement measures to prevent and control the epidemic, at around 5 p.m. on the same day submitted an application for resumption of work," Lu said.
2月13日，联合工作组通过全程代办的方式对该公司复工完成了审签备案，该公司于当日即组织复工。
On 13 February, the Joint Working Group completed its audit of the company's resumption of work on a commission-wide basis, and the company resumed work on the same day.
一天内完成审批能体现政府一站式服务的速度。
Completing the approval process in one day reflects the speed of the Government's one-stop shop.
”江阳区人民政府官网显示，江阳区区委书记杨长缨2月14日带队督导复工复产工作强调，相关部门和镇街要主动开展复工复产上门服务，严格落实相关扶持政策，切实降低企业负担。
Jiang Yang District People's Government's official website showed that on February 14, Yang Changyu, the district secretary of the Jiangyang District People's Government, led the resumption of work, stressing that relevant departments and township streets should take the initiative to resume work and resume production services, strictly implement relevant support policies and effectively reduce the burden on enterprises.
有企业需填21份材料2月18日，东莞一家印刷公司负责人表示，公司于18日申请复工时填了很多内容相同的表，要分别交给社区、街道及其不同的部门。
The head of a Dongguan printing company said Feb. 18, the company applied to resume work on the 18 filled out a lot of the same content to the community, the streets and its different departments.
他表示由于公司申请复工的人不多，填一个多小时填完了，如果人多，则需要耗费大量的时间。
He said it took more than an hour to fill in as the company did not have enough applicants to return to work, and that it would take a lot of time to fill in.
他建议，政府部门应充分利用大数据管控，用一个端口管理，公司复工不必层层报、时时报。
He suggested that government departments should make full use of big data control, with a port management, the company does not have to report back to work, time.
“否则智慧城市不如表格管用。
"Otherwise, smart cities don't work as well as tables.
”据记者了解，深圳一家待复工企业的情况则是：复工要提交申请资料，并盖公章。
According to the reporter, the case of a company waiting to return to work in Shenzhen is: to return to work to submit information and seal the official seal.
公章在办公室，但办公室被封锁了，资料没办法提交。
The official seal is in the office, but the office is blocked and the documents cannot be submitted.
可是不审批通过的话，就没法进入办公室。
But you can't get into the office without approval.
据《新华每日电讯》报道，近期有不少申请复工的企业负责人抱怨，企业想复工需要填15个表格、2份承诺书，制定1个应急预案、1个复工方案、1套食堂防护措施和1套宿舍防护措施，共计21份材料，有些材料还需要去街道盖章。
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, a number of company officials recently complained that companies wishing to resume work needed to fill in 15 forms, two statements of commitment, develop a contingency plan, a work resumption programme, a canteen protection measure and a dormitory protection measure, totalling 21 pieces of material, some of which require street stamping.
其中有不少表格是重复的。
Many of these tables are repetitive.
仅“复工企业上岗人员”这一项，就需提交4份表格——首批上岗人员汇总表、首批上岗职工健康统计表、后续需上岗职工健康统计汇总表、后续需上岗职工健康统计表，且每份表格都需要企业盖章。
In order to get back to work, four forms must be submitted - the first induction summary table, the first induction health statistics, the follow-up health statistics matrix for the on-boarding staff, and the health statistics form for those who need to be on duty, and each form needs to be stamped by the enterprise.
这些表格看起来设计得严丝合缝，却忽视了企业的具体情况：比如，有些企业可能一次性全员复工，有些企业用工流动性很大，后续上岗人员无法确定等。
The forms look neat, but ignore the specifics of the company: for example, some companies may return to work at one time, others have a high level of mobility and follow-up personnel cannot be identified.
2月11日，国家发展改革委社会发展司司长欧晓理在新闻发布会上表示：“我们注意到，在防控期间，很多地方都出台了很严格的限制人员进出措施。
"We have noticed that during the prevention and control period, a lot of places have put in place very strict measures to restrict the entry and exit of people," Ou Xiaoli, director of the Social Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a press conference.
比如，有的地方还对企业的复工复产采取了报备制度，有的设置了前置审批条件，甚至还有个别地方出现了拘留提前复工企业负责人的情况。
For example, some places have adopted a reporting system for the resumption of work by enterprises, some have set pre-conditions for approval, and some have even seen the detention of persons responsible for the early resumption of work.
这些做法是不符合加强疫情科学防控、有序做好企业复工复产的中央精神的。
These measures are not in line with strengthening the scientific control of the epidemic, orderly do a good job enterprises to resume production of the central spirit.
此风不可长。
The wind cannot last long.
在这里明确和大家说，我们将严格制止以审批等简单粗暴方式限制企业复工复产的做法。
In this clear and everyone said, we will strictly stop the approval and other simple rough way to limit the resumption of business operations.
”欧晓理还说：“我们充分理解一些地方希望进一步压实责任，严格做好疫情防控工作、防止疫情扩散的良苦用心，也非常赞同在开复工过程中严格督促企业落实防控机制。
"We fully understand that some places wish to further tighten their responsibilities, strictly carry out prevention and control of the epidemic and prevent the spread of the disease, and we are very much in favor of strict supervision and control of the prevention and control mechanism in the process of starting work," he said.
但是我们不能简单化地通过设置审批条件、提高开复工门槛等办法，来达到防护目的，而是应该用更多的时间和精力去指导、关心、帮助企业解决疫情防控和开复工中碰到的实际问题。
However, we should not simply set up examination and approval conditions, improve the threshold of resumption of work to achieve the purpose of protection, but should use more time and energy to guide, care, help enterprises solve the disease prevention and control and practical problems encountered in the resumption of work.
