方舱医院患者出院还是比较快的，这样周转起来，就可以接收大量的病人，可以做到“应收尽收”。
Fang cabin hospital patient discharge or relatively fast, so turn over, can receive a large number of patients, can do "receivable".
文 | 黄　祺13天前，武汉新冠肺炎疫情仿如“暗夜”——社区还有大量感染者未能得到诊断，他们如果得不到及时的治疗，病情很可能变重；而且，他们会感染周边其他健康人，成为疫情扩大的源头。
WHEN WONG was 13 days ago, the Wuhan New Crown Pneumonia epidemic was like a "dark night" - a large number of people in the community who have not been diagnosed and who are likely to become seriously ill if not treated promptly; and who are infected with other healthy people in their immediate vicinity and the source of the epidemic's spread.
2月3日，建设方舱医院的方案公布。
On 3 February, the programme for the construction of the cabin hospital was announced.
当天，武汉市征用体育馆、展览馆、学校教室等空间改建为病房。
On that day, Wuhan city requisitioned gymnasiums, exhibition halls, school classrooms and other space converted into wards.
但是，光有病床没有用，为此，全国各地的医疗队紧急集合，赶赴武汉接手各家方舱医院的管理。
However, beds alone are not useful, so medical teams from all over the country gathered urgently to take over the management of each cabin hospital in Wuhan.
复旦大学附属华山医院接到再次组队支持武汉的要求后，立即组建了一支由46位救援队员、6辆移动救援车组成的复旦大学附属华山医院赴鄂国家紧急医学救援队。
Fudan University attached to the Huashan Hospital received a request to organize support for Wuhan, immediately formed a 46-member rescue team, six mobile rescue vehicles, the affiliated Huashan Hospital of Fudan University to Huashan National Emergency Medical Rescue Team.
医疗队由华山医院副院长马昕教授任领队、感染科副主任张继明教授任队长，医务处贾波和后勤保障部副主任王兵任副队长，队员包括临床医生、护士、医技、管理、后保等医院各部门骨干人员。
Professor Ma Xin, Vice-Dean of Huashan Hospital, Professor Zhang Jiming, Deputy Director of Infection Department, are the team leaders, and Japo Japo, Medical Service Department, and Wang Bing, Deputy Director of Logistics Support, are the team leaders of various departments of the hospital, including clinicians, nurses, medical technicians, management and support staff.
这支国家紧急医学救援队后来被编号为“华山医院第三批支援武汉医疗队”，简称“三纵队”，因为2月9日，又有一支215人的华山医院第四批医疗队奔赴武汉。
The national emergency medical team was later named the "third batch of support to Wuhan medical team," or "three columns," because on February 9, another 215-member Huashan Hospital's fourth medical team went to Wuhan.
马昕副院长被任命为华山医院援鄂医疗队总指挥。
Vice-president Ma Xin appointed as the Huashan Hospital medical team commander.
华山医院“三纵队”到达武汉当天，医疗队迅速展开帐篷医院，仅仅用了几个小时完成所有准备工作，当天就开始收治病人。
When the three columns of the Huashan Hospital arrived in Wuhan on the same day, the medical team quickly opened the tent hospital, took only a few hours to complete all the preparatory work, the same day began to accept patients.
截至2月14日，武汉已经开放9个方舱医院，收治5606名患者。
As of February 14, Wuhan had opened nine cabin hospitals, treating 5,606 patients.
目前，华山医院三纵队在洪山体育馆的武昌方舱医院内工作，负责250张床位。
At present, the three columns of Huashan Hospital work in Wuchang Square Hospital of Hongshan Stadium and are responsible for 250 beds.
《新民周刊》2月13日晚间采访了华山医院副院长、华山医院援鄂医疗队总指挥马昕教授。
On the evening of February 13, Xinmin Weekly interviewed Professor MBA Xin, Vice-President of Huashan Hospital and Head of Huashan Medical Team.
方舱医院出院人数持续增加《新民周刊》：华山医院医疗队负责的方舱医院，是最早收治病人的方舱医院，当时是怎么做到的？马昕：2月5日，我们46人组成的华山医院第三批医疗队到达洪山体育馆，一到达就开始展开我们的帐篷医院，几个小时候就开始收治病人。
The number of patients discharged from Fang Min Hospital continued to increase: The Fang Min Hospital, run by the Medical Team of Huashan Hospital, was the first to accept patients.
当时的工作主要是对社区送来的病人进行预检，包括登记他们的病情，为他们做胸部X光检查，血液检查。
At that time, the work consisted mainly of pre-screening of patients brought in by the community, including registration of their condition, chest X-rays and blood tests.
我们从上海开来的6辆医疗车，其中就包含了影像医学车和检验车，我们也带来了影像医学医生和检验师，所以开展工作速度比较快。
We brought in six medical cars from Shanghai, including an imaging medical car and a test car, and we brought in imaging doctors and examiners, so we worked faster.
方舱医院第一批值班医务人员《新民周刊》：方舱医院收治病人的前一两天，不少患者抱怨里面条件不好。
"Xinmin Weekly," the first medical staff on duty at Fang Cao Hospital: A day or two before the patients were admitted to the hospital, many patients complained about the poor conditions inside.
现在的情况如何？马昕：的确，第一天方舱医院里还有很多保障没做好，有时候会断电，很冷。
How are things goingMBA: It is true that there are still many safeguards in the Fangcao Hospital on the first day, sometimes there will be power outages and it will be cold.
但很快这些问题都解决了，空调开起来，里面很暖和。
But soon all these problems were solved. The air conditioner was turned on and it was warm inside.
患者吃的盒饭我看过，比我的盒饭好。
I've seen the boxed rice the patient ate. It's better than my boxed lunch.
最近我们还有一些管理上的创新。
We've also had some management innovations lately.
比如我们发动病人做志愿者，病人当中有些人本来就有管理经验，也有帮助别人的热情，他们可以帮护士发发饭，整理整理病房。
For example, we start people as volunteers, some of whom already have management experience and a passion for helping others. They can help nurses serve food and tidy up the wards.
患者之间互相帮助、互相鼓励，对他们的心理健康也有好处。
Helping each other and encouraging each other is also good for their mental health.
大家从电视上也看到了，病房里还开展了一些简单的健身活动，做做操、跳跳舞。
As you can see from the TV, there are some simple exercise activities in the ward, doing exercises and dancing.
方舱医院的作用，不仅是提供身体疾病的治疗，也要关注到心理上的康复，大家在一起，就不会那么恐惧。
The role of the cabin hospital is not only to provide the treatment of physical illness, but also to pay attention to psychological rehabilitation, people together, less fear.
一位正在康复的患者和医生交流后，与医生愉快合影《新民周刊》：方舱医院可以给患者提供哪些医疗服务？马昕：我们的医生每天早晚两次查房，了解患者的病情。
Xin Min Weekly: What kind of medical service can Fang Xin Hospital provide to patients? MBA: Our doctor inspects the room twice a day to find out the patient's condition.
我们会给予必要的口服用药，有西药也有中药。
We will give the necessary oral medicine, both Western and Chinese medicine.
有的患者有其他基础疾病，比如糖尿病、心脏病，我们也会给予药物治疗。
Some patients have other basic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, we will also give medication.
主要是口服用药，必要的会采取静脉用药的方式。
Mainly oral medicine, if necessary, will take the form of intravenous medication.
我们要给病人定期拍胸部X光，做核酸检测，然后结合临床表现，根据规范来判定病人是不是符合出院的标准。
We will take regular chest X-rays, do a nucleic acid test, and then combine the clinical manifestations to determine whether the patient meets the criteria for discharge from the hospital.
符合出院标准的就可以出院，回到家庭。
Those who meet the discharge criteria can be discharged and returned to their families.
当然我们现在还是建议回到家庭的出院病人继续隔离2周。
Of course, we now recommend that discharged patients returning to their homes remain in isolation for another two weeks.
2月11日，方舱医院第一批34名患者出院，其中武昌方舱医院就有28人出院。
On 11 February, the first 34 patients were discharged from the Fang Causeway Hospital, of which 28 were discharged from the Fang Cavern Hospital in Wuchang.
病人出院给大家信心，也可以让床位流转起来，接收更多的病人。
Patients discharged from the hospital to give everyone confidence, but also to allow beds to flow up, to receive more patients.
现在每天都有几十人出院，接下来方舱医院每天出院的病人可能超过百人。
Dozens of people are now discharged from the hospital every day, followed by the cabin hospital may be more than 100 patients a day.
体育馆改建医院安全吗？《新民周刊》：华山医疗队在洪山体育馆的武昌方舱医院已经工作11天，目前我们具体怎样工作？马昕：洪山体育馆总共有800张床位，华山医院、湘雅二院、中国医科大学一附院的医疗队以及外省市支援的两支护理团队，与武汉当地的医护人员一起，共同管理武昌方舱医院，总共有13支医疗护理队伍一起合作工作。
How can we work at the Wuchang Fangcao Hospital of Hongshan Stadium for 11 daysMa Xin: There are 800 beds in Hongshan Stadium, the Medical Team of Xiangya Hospital, a hospital attached to the Chinese Medical University and two nursing teams supported by local medical staff in Wuhan.
各家医院有各自的任务。
Each hospital has its own mandate.
华山医院医疗队与武汉大学人民医院的医护人员一起管理250张床位。
The Huashan Hospital Medical Team, together with medical staff from Wuhan University People's Hospital, manages 250 beds.
华山医院有20位医生和护士，还有其他技术人员。
There are 20 doctors and nurses and other technicians at Huashan Hospital.
我们带来的感染科的精兵强将，以咨询班的形式参与工作。
We bring the best members of the Infection Department to work in the form of advisory classes.
《新民周刊》：管理250张床位，医护人员压力大不大？马昕：方舱医院运转了10天，现在流程越来越顺，有了自己的规范。
Xin Min Weekly: Managed 250 beds with little pressure on medical staff? MA Xin: Fang Xin Hospital operated for 10 days, now the process is getting smoother and has its own norms.
我们这两天也开始尝试一些新的方式，发现效果特别好。
We've been trying some new things over the last couple of days, and we've found them to be particularly effective.
比如说我们开始用平板电脑查房，病人在病房里通过平板电脑，与在清洁区的医生交流。
For example, we began to use tablets to search rooms, where patients used tablets to communicate with doctors in the cleanup area.
方舱医院里的患者是轻症患者，多数患者不需要每天躯体检查，主要是语言的交流。
The patient in the cabin hospital is a mild case. Most of the patients do not need daily physical examination, mainly language communication.
用了这个新方法后，一方面医生查房效率提高了，在清洁区医生查看资料更方便。
With this new method, on the one hand, the efficiency of doctors to check room, in the cleaning area doctors more convenient access to information.
另一方面病人也满意。
On the other hand the patient was satisfied.
因为进病房我们的医生必须穿好防护服，带着护目镜、手套，翻阅资料非常不方便，所以医生跟每个人谈话的时间不可能很充分。
Because our doctors have to wear protective clothing, goggles, gloves, and look at the information, it is very inconvenient, so doctors can not talk to everyone very sufficient time.
现在通过视频查房，病人跟医生沟通更充分了。
Now through the video room, the patient and the doctor communicate more fully.
必要的进病房查房我们要做到，比如对重点病人的检查，但不必要的职业暴露可以减少。
Necessary Inpatient Inspection We do this, for example, by screening key patients, but unnecessary occupational exposure can be reduced.
《新民周刊》：在方舱医院工作，最大的挑战是什么？马昕：方舱医院是体育馆改建的，院感控制是一个难题。
Xin Min Weekly: What is the biggest challenge in working in Fang CauseMa Xin: Fang Xin Hospital is a gymnasium rebuilt, and the control of the hospital is a problem.
如果这里面出问题，不仅是医护人员，这里面还有警察、保安、保洁员等等，都是有危险的。
If there's a problem here, it's not just the paramedics, it's the cops, the guards, the cleaners, all of which are dangerous.
华山医院在院感方面非常强，所以我们的专家主动承担起了整个洪山体育馆的院感设计和优化工作。
Huashan Hospital in the sense of very strong, so our experts took the initiative to undertake the whole Hongshan Stadium design and optimization of the hospital.
华山医院感染科副主任张继明教授，带着护士长，把方舱医院每个角落都跑了一遍。
Professor Zhang Jiming, deputy director of infection department of Huashan Hospital, took the head nurse and ran every nook and cranny of the hospital.
什么地方是清洁区，什么地方是污染区，进出的流程是怎样的，规范怎么制定，这些都是华山医院的专家在做。
What is a clean area, what is a polluted area, what is the flow of entry and exit, and how to make standards are all done by experts at Huashan Hospital.
我们还承担了大量的院感培训工作。
We have also undertaken a great deal of in-house training.
方舱医院里工作的医护人员，有的年资比较低，有的是其他专业紧急调来的，大家都要先做好培训再上岗。
The medical staff working in the cabin hospital, some of the junior years of experience, some other professional emergency transfer, we have to do a good job training before induction.
到现在我们已经做了近千人的培训，包括我们自己住的酒店，连酒店员工都要培训，这样才能保证所有人的安全。
Up to now we have done nearly a thousand training, including our own hotel, even hotel staff have to be trained, so as to ensure the safety of all.
院感流程做好了，我们才能放开手脚去工作，如果不做好准备，是极不科学的。
The sense of the process is done, we can be free to work, if not prepared, it is very unscientific.
这几天，华山医院的专家牵头制定了方舱医院轻症患者的诊疗流程和标准，目前正在做最后的整理，有了标准和流程，运行起来效率就更高了。
In the past few days, experts from Huashan Hospital have taken the lead in formulating procedures and standards for the diagnosis and treatment of light cases in Fang Cao Hospital, which are now being finalised and made more efficient with the standards and procedures.
“应收尽收”，方舱医院能承受吗？《新民周刊》：武汉提出“应收尽收”的目标，方舱医院有能力承接这么多病人吗？马昕：“应收尽收”是目前控制武汉疫情发展最关键的一个措施。
Xin Min Weekly: Is Fang Cao Hospital capable of handling so many patients? Xin Xin: "Receivable is the most important measure to control the development of Wuhan epidemic."
如果病人在社区里，家庭隔离的条件肯定是不够的。
If the patient is in the community, the conditions of family isolation are certainly not sufficient.
他们要吃饭，要跟别人接触，他们就可能是传染源。
They need to eat, they need to get in touch with people, they can be a source of infection.
患者在社区里可以一个传染三个，三个传九个，感染人数几何级数的增长，这对疫情控制非常不利。
Patients in the community can infect three, three pass nine, the number of infections exponentially increased, which is very detrimental to epidemic control.
方舱医院建设起来比较快，社区里的病人能够住进来，一方面他们可以得到治疗，病情重的我们及时转到收治重病人的医疗机构。
The Fang Cavern Hospital was built so quickly that patients in the community could come in. On the one hand, they could be treated.
另一方面，在这里集中隔离，就切断了社区传染。
On the other hand, the concentration of isolation here cuts off community transmission.
如果方舱医院的床位数，比确诊病人多，患者都收进来了，疫情就能控制了，所以“应收尽收”策略是对的。
If the number of beds in the cabin hospital is greater than the number of patients diagnosed and the patient is admitted, the outbreak can be controlled, so the "receivable" strategy is correct.
目前看，方舱医院患者出院还是比较快的，这样周转起来，就可以接收大量的病人，可以做到“应收尽收”。
At present, the patients discharged from the cabin hospital or relatively fast, so that turnover, can receive a large number of patients, can do "receivable."
2月11日，首批出院患者走出武昌方舱医院《新民周刊》：方舱医院对于公众来说很陌生，这里面能保证患者的安全吗？会增加感染风险吗？马昕：方舱医院并不是新鲜事物，中外历史上都用过。
On Feb. 11, the first patients discharged from Wuchang Fang Cavern Hospital came out of Xinmin Weekly, Wuchang Hospital. Is it safe for the public? Does it increase the risk of infection? MA Xin: Fang Cao Hospital is not new and has been used in Chinese and foreign history.
一般而言，重大的自然灾害后，比如地震、洪灾以后，方舱医院作为初步治疗和收容病人的医院，可以收治大量的病人。
In general, after major natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, the Fangcao Hospital serves as a primary hospital for the treatment and accommodation of patients and can accommodate a large number of patients.
方舱医院的核心是移动医院，这次全国70多家医院开来了自己的移动医院，每个移动医院由六七辆医疗车组成，有宿营车、水电车、炊事车、影像车、检验车，每辆车都像变形金刚一样，展开来就是一家野战医院。
At the heart of the hospital is the mobile hospital. This time, more than 70 hospitals across the country have opened their own mobile hospitals, each consisting of six or seven medical vehicles, including campers, hydroelectric vehicles, cooking vans, video cars, inspection vehicles, each of which, like Transformers, unfolds as a field hospital.
征用体育馆、校舍做病房，是方舱医院的延伸，这样方舱医院就可以收治更多病人。
The requisitioning of gymnasiums and school buildings for wards is an extension of the Fang Cao Hospital, which can accommodate more patients.
方舱医院在传染病疫情中的应用过去也有过。
The application of Fang Cavern Hospital in the epidemic of infectious diseases has also been used in the past.
1988年上海甲肝疫情，30万人感染。
In 1988, the Shanghai hepatitis A epidemic affected 300,000 people.
当时正值寒假，政府征用了大量的校舍，用来隔离病人，实际上也是方舱医院的概念。
During the winter vacation, the Government requisitioned a large number of school buildings to isolate patients, which was in fact the concept of a square-cabin hospital.
上海甲肝控制取得了胜利，很了不起。
The success of hepatitis A control in Shanghai is remarkable.
《新民周刊》：2月9日华山医院第四批医疗队出征，接手了华中科技大学同济医学院附属同济大学光谷院区的ICU病房。
New People's Weekend: February 9, the fourth medical team Huashan Hospital, took over the Tongji University Tongji Medical College affiliated with the ICU Ward.
您是华山医院援鄂医疗队总指挥，请介绍一下这一支医疗队的情况。
You are the commander-in-chief of Huashan Hospital medical team. Please introduce this medical team.
马昕：我现在每天都要到两个地方，一个是洪山体育馆武昌方舱医院，一个是同济医院光谷院区，两个地方相距15公里。
MBA: I am going to two places every day. One is Wuchang Fang Hospital of Hongshan Stadium and the other is Guanggu Campus of Tongji Hospital, two places 15 km apart.
华山医院医疗队2月9日到武汉，2月10日中午去医院交接工作，晚上10点就正式开始收治病人，速度非常快。
The medical team from Huashan Hospital arrived in Wuhan on February 9 and went to the hospital for hand-over work at noon on February 10.
我们负责30张床位，有的是单间，有的是两人一间，目前已经住进了20多名危重症病人。
We are responsible for 30 beds, some single or two, and have now admitted more than 20 critically ill patients.
这个危重症病房是康复病房改建的，各方面硬件条件基本能达到要求。
This critically ill ward is the rehabilitation ward reconstruction, all aspects of the hardware conditions can basically meet the requirements.
光谷院区我们第一重视的也是院感，硬件不足软件补，我们要用规范流程，来把院感风险降到最低。
Gwanggu courtyard area is also our first attention to the sense of the hospital, hardware shortage software repair, we need to use the standard process, to minimize hospital risk.
两边的患者情况完全不一样，方舱医院里是轻症患者，光谷院区我们华山医院管理的是最危重的病人，是其他重症病房转来的，病情都非常重。
The two sides of the patient situation is completely different, the square cabin hospital is a light patient, Guang Gu courtyard area of our Huashan Hospital is managing the most critical patients, are transferred from other intensive care units, very serious illness.
其他重症病房的人员配置，130名医护人员管50张病床。
The other intensive care units are staffed with 130 medical staff with 50 beds.
但我们管的危重症监护室，210名医护人员管30张床。
But in our critical care unit, 210 paramedics have 30 beds.
为什么医护力量配备不一样？就是因为病人病情非常重，对于我们来说是攻坚克难，我们的任务是使出十八般武艺，提高治愈率，降低病死率。
Why is the medical force provided differently? It is because the patient is very sick, which is difficult for us, our task is to use 18 skills, improve the cure rate, reduce the fatality rate.
