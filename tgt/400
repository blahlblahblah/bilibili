On February 2, according to Wuhan city control command request, the new crown pneumonia confirmed patients concentrated treatment, suspected patients concentrated isolation, febrile patients, close contacts concentrated observation.

其中，部分医院存在已用床位大于开放床位情况，这是因为部分医院按“应收尽收”要求，为收治更多疑似患者，尽最大努力安排加床，导致开放床位不完全等于已用床位加上空床位。
Among them, some hospitals have more beds available than those open, because some hospitals try their best to arrange extra beds to treat more suspected patients according to the "receivable" requirement, resulting in the opening of beds that are not fully equal to the number of beds available plus vacant beds.
