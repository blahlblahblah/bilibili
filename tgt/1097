向风暴眼输送防护物资并非易事武汉市中心医院医生发布微博求助，希望社会各界捐物资。
It is not easy to send protective materials to storm eyes.
图源：微博截图2月12日晚，武汉中心医院的一位医生在微博发出求助。
Source: Weibo screenshot February 12 night, Wuhan Central Hospital, a doctor in Weibo for help.
这位身穿防护服的医生对镜头说，医用N95没有了，只能戴工业口罩，医用鞋套没有了，穿一次性垃圾袋，而他的防护服之下，是一件“薄如蝉翼的隔离衣”。
The doctor in protective clothing told the camera that the N95 was missing, that industrial masks were worn out, that there were no medical shoelaces, that he was wearing a disposable garbage bag, and that under his protective clothing was a "cicada-thin jacket."
“希望大家尽手中的力量，让医务人员的血不要白流，能捐一点物资就尽量捐一点物资，让我们不要没有铠甲，赤身裸体地上战场。
"I hope we all do our best, so that the blood of medical personnel do not flow in vain, can donate a little material as much as possible, let us not have armor, naked on the battlefield.
”关掉摄像头，他走向病区查房，有34位新冠肺炎病人等着他照顾。
Turning off the camera, he walked to the sick area to see if he was looking after 34 patients with pneumonia.
一天过去，这则求助视频引发超过3万次转发和5千多条评论，不少网友想将家中口罩捐给医院，“我有3个N95 能邮寄给你们吗？”“我有25个美国N95，能用不？顺丰给你们。
Over the course of the day, the help video elicited more than 30,000 referrals and more than 5,000 comments. Many netizens wanted to donate their masks to the hospital. "Can I mail you three N95?"
”2月13日，记者致电武汉市中心医院相关医护人员了解到，N95医用口罩的确没有了，医护人员用外科口罩叠加防尘口罩、工业口罩，求助医生口中“薄如蝉翼”的隔离衣也领不到了。
"On February 13, doctors and nurses called Wuhan Central Hospital to learn that N95 medical masks were missing. Medical staff had used surgical masks to cover dust masks and industrial masks, and had been denied access to what doctors called" cicadas. "
另外，护士对患者进行咽拭子采样时，需要佩戴面罩避免感染，但目前无面罩可用。
In addition, nurses need to wear masks to avoid infection when sampling swabs from patients, but currently no masks are available.
前线物资仍有缺口 医院呼吁社会捐赠缺防护物资的不止这家医院。
There is still a gap in supplies on the frontline The hospital is not the only one appealing to the community to donate protective materials.
2月10日，武汉市第一医院发布公告呼吁社会捐赠物资。
On February 10, Wuhan First Hospital issued a notice appealing to the community to donate materials.
次日，记者向医院工作人员了解到，武汉第一医院将于2月12日接收1000余名新冠肺炎患者。
The next day, the reporter learned from hospital staff, Wuhan first hospital will be February 12 to receive more than 1,000 patients with new crown pneumonia.
“目前每天有400套防护服，病人转进来以后物资会比较紧张。
"There are 400 suits a day right now and things are going to be a little bit tight when the patient comes in.
”武汉市第一医院2月10日发布物资全面告急公告武汉天佑医院2月5日也发布了紧缺物品清单。
Wuhan Tianyu Hospital on February 5 also issued a list of items in short supply.
2月10日，医院相关工作人员透露，目前防护服紧缺且不够达标，他们在防护服里穿雨衣，在身上裹上保鲜膜进行防护。
On 10 February, hospital staff revealed that protective clothing was in short supply and below standard and that they were wearing raincoats and were protected by plastic sheeting.
此外，武汉儿童医院、武汉市第四医院和武汉市中心医院也分别于2月9日、2月7日和2月6日发布了急需物资清单，呼吁社会捐赠。
In addition, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan Fourth Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital issued lists of urgently needed materials on 9 February, 7 February and 6 February, respectively, appealing for donations from the community.
自武汉暴发新冠病毒疫情以来，这是前线医院第三次发来呼救。
This is the third call for help from the Frontline Hospital since the outbreak of the new crown virus in Wuhan.
1月23日，武汉大学人民医院、武汉大学人民医院、协和医院等8家医院相继发出公告，紧急向社会各界募集防护用品。
On January 23, eight hospitals, including Wuhan University People's Hospital, Wuhan University People's Hospital and Hip Wo Hospital, issued notices to urgently collect protective articles from the general public.
那次呼吁让人们意识到，湖北面对的情况异常严峻，也引发了民间对湖北的第一拨物资支援。
The appeal made people realize that the situation facing Hubei was very serious, and triggered the first batch of civilian material support to Hubei.
1月30日，协和医院再次发出紧急救助——医疗物资不是“告急”，而是“快没有了”，引发大众对于武汉红十字会分配物资效率的质疑。
On January 30, Concorde issued another emergency rescue - medical supplies were "running out" rather than "running out," raising questions about the efficiency of the Wuhan Red Cross's distribution of supplies.
质疑之外，校友会、华侨团体和留学生团体再次出动，在世界各地采买物资。
In addition to the doubts, alumni associations, overseas Chinese groups and groups of international students again out to buy goods around the world.
钟南山院士估计，此次疫情可能在2月中下旬达到峰值，希望在4月能结束。
Academics in Zhong Nan Shan estimate the outbreak could peak in late February and hope to end in April.
在这场持久战中，仅外省支援湖北的医护人员就接近2万人，湖北一次性医用防护用品消耗庞大，缺口仍在。
During the protracted war, nearly 20,000 medical workers from other provinces supported Hubei province alone. Hubei consumed large quantities of disposable medical protective equipment, and the gap remained.
在2月8日举行的“新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控工作”新闻发布会上，湖北省副省长曹广晶指出，目前湖北省医疗物资供应是“一种非常紧张的、动态的基本满足”，并表示“随着疫情的不断变化，部分医疗物资短缺的矛盾，可能还会变得突出”。
Cao Guangjing, vice-governor of Hubei province, said at a press conference on Feb. 8 that the supply of medical supplies in Hubei province was "a very tense and dynamic basic satisfaction" and said "the shortage of some medical supplies may become more pronounced as the epidemic evolves."
他拿防护服供应情况举例，2月7日全省医用防护物资的最低需求是5.94万套，但算上中央部委、兄弟省市的支持，以及社会各界的定向捐助，全省能够供应的防护服只有4.85万套，还有接近1.1万的缺口。
He cited the example of the supply of protective clothing, for which a minimum of 59,400 sets were required throughout the province on 7 February, but with the support of central ministries, brother provinces and municipalities and targeted donations from various sectors of society, only 48,500 protective clothing sets were available throughout the province, leaving a gap of close to 11,000.
这仅是湖北省一天的防护服缺口。
It's just a one-day gap in protective clothing in Hubei province.
黄冈市委书记刘雪荣提出，目前黄冈市最紧缺的是N95口罩、医用防护服、护目镜等防护用品。
Liu Xueyong, the Huanggang Communist Party secretary, said that the city is most in need of N95 masks, medical protective clothing, goggles and other protective equipment.
为了补上物资和药品缺口，除了协调争取、紧急采购、复工复产等方式外，社会支援也是重要渠道。
In order to fill the gap in supplies and medicines, social support is also an important channel, in addition to coordinated efforts, emergency procurement and the resumption of work.
民间捐赠在行动截至2月7日，党中央、国务院、工信部、发改委等国家各部委、各兄弟省市区（新疆建设兵团）支援湖北省医疗防护物资累计达1千万件次以上；社会各界捐赠的医疗防护物资也达到1千万件次以上。
Civil Donations As of February 7, the Central Committee of the Party, the State Council, the Ministry of Industry and Communications, the Development and Reform Commission and other state ministries and departments, as well as fraternal provinces and municipalities (Xinjiang Construction Corps), supported the medical and protective materials in Hubei Province more than 10 million times.
这1千万件次的社会捐赠物资背后，是数以万计的个人和以行业、地域、学校为纽带的团体。
Behind these 10 million social donations are tens of thousands of individuals and groups linked by industry, geography and school.
他们在全球防护物资短缺、海外出口限制和物流不通畅的情况下，从海内外争分夺秒输送物资，为前线医护人员编织了一层防护之网。
They weave a protective net for front-line health care workers by rushing supplies from home and abroad in the face of a global shortage of protective goods, overseas export restrictions and poor logistics.
大年三十，湖北人张科（化名）在曼谷把自己隔离了。
Year 30, Hubei people Zhang Ke (alias) in Bangkok to isolate themselves.
他原本在泰国参加培训班，得知新冠病毒可以人传人后，取消了回国的计划，“怕传染别人”。
He had attended a training session in Thailand, learned that the new crown virus can be passed from person to person, cancelled the plan to return home, "afraid of infecting others."
张科一边看春晚，一边刷朋友圈，看到满屏幕武汉医院物资紧缺的公告，他急哭了，“打仗的士兵连武器都没有了，连自己都保护不了，怎么去保护其他人？”他看到国内到处买不到口罩，琢磨着请人从泰国代购，寄回湖北一线。
When Zhang Ke watched the Spring Festival Gala while brushing his circle of friends and seeing the announcement of the shortage of materials for the screen Wuhan hospital, he burst into tears.
大年初一，张科在微博上找到一位女孩跑腿，买下20盒口罩，又联系上即将从泰国回国的时尚博主CK，将那批口罩交由她人肉带回。
On New Year's Day, Zhang found a girl running errands on Weibo, bought 20 boxes of masks, and contacted CK, the fashion blogger who is returning from Thailand, and handed the masks back to her.
虽然不能自由行动，但能“为围城中的同胞做点事情”，他心里终于宽慰了一些。
Though unable to move freely, he was relieved to be able to "do something for his fellow citizens in the besieged city."
在曼谷自我隔离的张科，微博找华人代购口罩寄回湖北一线“也许对国内的帮助杯水车薪，但是我想，哪怕能帮一个医生多坚持一天也好！”张科在日记里写道。
In Bangkok's self-contained Zhang Ke, Weibo asked the Chinese to buy masks and send them back to Hubei. "It may be a small help at home, but I think it's just as well to help a doctor for an extra day," Zhang wrote in his diary.
他开始钻研医用口罩的种种，学习欧标、美标、各种型号和灭菌工艺后，在志愿者群中帮助校友会、基金会等资方找货、比价、核对资质证书。
He began to study medical masks, learn European standards, American standards, various models and sterilization process, in the volunteer group to help alumni associations, foundations and other management find, compare prices, check qualification certificates.
隔离的日子里，他醒来第一件事是摸额头，咽口水，确认没有症状后，就抓起手机继续干活。
The first thing he wakes up in isolation is to touch his forehead, swallow his saliva, confirm that there are no symptoms, grab his cell phone and go on working.
地球的另一端，在英国读博的易微米（化名）因为疫情一宿一宿地失眠。
At the other end of the globe, easy micrometers (aliases) reading blogs in the UK are sleepless nights due to the epidemic.
一边刷疫情新闻，一边满世界找货，最疲倦和难过的那几天，她甚至哮喘发作了。
She even had an asthma attack the day she brushed the news of the epidemic and searched all over the world for goods.
她打趣地告诉《中国新闻周刊》，“我是典型的应激反应，不帮忙全身不舒服”。
"I'm a typical stress response," she jokingly told China News Weekly. "I'm not feeling well all over."
早在1月23日，她就从一家英国卫生用品网站买下3000个口罩，200多双护目镜和200套防护服。
As early as January 23, she bought 3,000 face masks, more than 200 goggles and 200 suits from a British hygiene site.
由于全球华人都在往国内运物资，清关速度较慢。
Customs clearance is slower as Chinese around the world are moving goods into the country.
她想到小包裹可以不用清关，于是将口罩、护目镜、防护服搭配组合成一个个小快递，通过华人物流公司空运到广州口岸，再由广州志愿者接力寄到湖北。
Thinking that small packages could be cleared without customs clearance, she combined masks, goggles and protective clothing into small couriers, which were flown to the Guangzhou port by Chinese logistics companies and sent to Hubei by a relay of volunteers from Guangzhou.
据她计算，这样的运送方式能比大宗物品运输快一周。
She calculates that this is a week faster than bulk shipments.
然而，随着抢购医疗用品的中国人越来越多，英国卖家坐地起价。
But with more Chinese snapping up medical supplies, British sellers are starting to bid.
眼看着医用外科口罩从5英磅50个涨到35英磅，易微米有心无力。
Watching medical surgical masks rise from 5 pounds and 50 pounds to 35 pounds, easy to micron heart weak.
她好友的父亲是武汉的医生，已经和冠状病毒近身搏斗了大半个月。
Her friend's father, a doctor from Wuhan, has been fighting the coronavirus for most of the month.
根据她了解到的情况，武汉定点医院依然很缺物资，“每天都缺”。
According to her understanding of the situation, Wuhan Ding Hospital is still very short of supplies, "daily shortage."
1月31日，BBC宣布英国确诊两例新型冠状病毒病例。
On January 31, the BBC announced the confirmation of two new coronavirus cases in the United Kingdom.
消息一出，易微米已经定下的口罩、防护服等订单接连被商家取消。
News, easy micron has been set up the mask, protective clothing and other orders have been cancelled by the merchant.
这不是个例，不少中国买家在志愿者群中表示，他们在西班牙、德国下的订单也被无理由退款。
This is not the case, with many Chinese buyers saying that their orders in Spain and Germany are also being refunded without reason.
她猜想，这些国家也可能要为疫情储备防护物资了。
Those countries, she guessed, might also be stockpiling protective supplies for the outbreak.
那就把眼光投向更远的地方，她发了一条朋友圈动员大家，“谁会希腊语、芬兰语、爱沙尼亚语，请帮忙联系经销商找货，谢谢！”采访阿昕（化名）的时候，他正拉着一车防护物资往巴黎戴高乐机场赶。
Then looking further afield, she launched a circle of friends to mobilize, "Who can speak Greek, Finnish, Estonian, please help contact dealers to find goods, thank you!"
阿昕是武汉人，也是曼彻斯特英超物流公司的负责人。
Axin is from Wuhan and is also the head of Manchester Premier Logistics.
他车上的物资是华人留学生组织捐赠的，原计划从伦敦发出，但是英国的航运舱位要等，他立马改从曼彻斯特开车到巴黎发货。
The cargo was donated by the Chinese International Student Organization, originally planned to come from London, but the shipping space in the UK had to wait until he was driven from Manchester to Paris.
为了尽快将物资送上飞机，阿昕从曼彻斯顿开车到巴黎他很着急地说，此刻，他的家人和高中同学们正在武汉一线抗击病毒，“国难当头，我等不了”。
Axin drove to Paris from Manchester to Paris to get supplies on board as soon as possible. His family and high school classmates were fighting the virus on the front line in Wuhan.
疫情当前，华侨、校友会、各地政府都在欧洲买防护物资，不仅导致防护价格水涨船高，还间接抬高了飞往中国的货运舱位，“每公斤运费涨价20多倍”。
At present, overseas Chinese, alumni associations and local governments are buying protective materials in Europe, leading not only to higher protection prices, but also indirectly to an increase in the shipping space available to China "by more than 20 times per kilogram."
但是为了支援武汉，他顶住压力给寄往湖北的所有救灾物资一律免邮费。
But in order to support Wuhan, he resisted pressure to send all relief materials to Hubei free postage.
目前，阿昕个人捐赠的物资加帮华人垫付的运费已经超过70万元，他笑笑地说其实也心疼钱，“但现在不是赚钱的时候”。
At present, Axin personal donation plus the freight cost of the Chinese advance has exceeded 700,000 yuan, he said with a smile, "but this is not the time to make money."
困局之下心有余力不足对于赤手空拳的普通人，向风暴眼输送防护物资并非易事。
Without spare power It is not easy for the ordinary man with bare hands to carry protective materials to the eye of the storm.
筹措资金、找货、打通物流，每个环节都像闯关。
Fund-raising, looking for goods, open logistics, every link is like a breakthrough.
拥有89万微博粉丝的博主CK带着家人去曼谷过春节，看到武汉传来物资告急的消息，她暂停原本行程，直奔药店扫货。
The blog owner, 89, 000 Weibo fans, took her family to Bangkok for the Spring Festival. Seeing news of an emergency in Wuhan, she stopped the trip and headed straight to the drugstore to sweep the goods.
跑空了几家药店才找到200包N95口罩，CK赶紧拍照发给一位做医生的同学问资质。
After running through several pharmacies to find 200 packs of N95 masks, CK quickly took photos and sent them to a doctor to ask for qualifications.
焦急等待确认的过程中，一对香港夫妇站在她身边。
A Hong Kong couple stands beside her as she waits anxiously for confirmation.
CK猜，他们可能在等她放弃购买，然后接手那批口罩。
They may be waiting for her to give up the purchase, and then take over the mask, according to CK.
没成想，等她结账完，他们才说是担心她拿不动那么多东西，帮她把6大购物袋的口罩提回了酒店。
Unexpectedly, when she finished the checkout, they said they were worried that she couldn't carry so many things and helped her to take the six shopping bags of masks back to the hotel.
一开始，她的父母不理解这样的采购行为，“你能帮到多少呢？”她反驳，“如果每个都这么想的话，没有人帮忙了，岂不是更糟糕？” 她把买口罩的过程记录下来，希望能鼓励身在海外的游客把口罩人肉回国，“蚂蚁搬家”式支持前线。
"How much can you help?" she retorted. "If everyone thinks so, no one helps, isn't it?" She writes down the process of buying masks, hoping to encourage visitors overseas to bring back meat from the masks and "ant move" to the front line.
微博发出后，大量志愿者的私信涌来，“大多数都不是为了自己在奔波，我突然发现我的工作好像停不下来了”。
"Most of it wasn't for my own sake. I suddenly found that my job just couldn't stop."
CK开始寻求海外经销商渠道，最终从印度抢到12000只N95口罩。
CK began looking for overseas dealerships and eventually snapped 12,000 N95 masks from India.
说是抢并不夸张，那几天大量华人在印度下单防护用品，几乎买空了药店的库存。
It is no exaggeration to say that the looting was not an exaggeration. A large number of Chinese placed orders for protective equipment in India in those days, almost emptying pharmacies of stock.
她用自己信誉做担保，在2小时内筹到资金，请2名志愿者人肉将口罩带回国。
Using her credibility as a pledge, she was able to raise money within two hours for two volunteers to take their masks home.
但随着春节假期结束，海外度假的中国人陆续回国，越来越难找到志愿者人肉带物资回国。
But with the Spring Festival coming to an end, it is becoming more and more difficult for Chinese to find volunteers to bring home with them.
同时，中国境外的确诊人数也牵动着各国政府的防护用品出口政策。
At the same time, the number of confirmed cases outside China also affects the export policies of governments.
1月31日，印度外贸总局官网发布通告，由于新冠肺炎疫情蔓延，印度将暂时禁止出口口罩、防护服等防护设备。
India will temporarily ban the export of face masks, protective clothing and other protective equipment in the wake of the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, the official website of the General Administration of Foreign Trade announced on January 31.
此前一天，印度出现首例新冠病毒确诊病例。
The day before, India had its first confirmed case of the new crown virus.
CK不由得发愁，志愿者原本计划第二天拉着7400只N95口罩从新德里飞往广州，万一被查行李怎么办？同样着急的还有电影《我不是药神》原型陆勇先生，他在印度定到了数量可观的3M口罩，正打算通过航运寄回国。
The volunteers were planning to fly 7,400 N95 masks from New Delhi to Guangzhou the next day in case of checked baggage, and Mr. Lu Yong, who ordered a sizeable number of 3M masks in India and was planning to send them back by sea.
为了避免被印度海关拦截，他在微博上发布求助，希望从新德里回昆明旅客，每人帮带外科口罩若干回国，落地后会有人对接取货。
To avoid being intercepted by Indian customs, he posted a request for help on Weibo, hoping to return to Kunming from New Delhi.
陆勇还承诺，帮忙的旅客每人可获得10个口罩。
Lu also promised that each passenger who helped would be given 10 face masks.
陆勇找到中国游客从新德里人肉带回口罩。
Lu Yong finds Chinese tourists bringing back masks from New Delhi meat.
图源：微博@药侠陆勇除印度外，泰国、越南也宣布了对口罩出口的相关管制消息。
Source: Weibo @ pharmacist Lu Yong in addition to India, Thailand, Vietnam also announced the control of the export of masks.
海外防护物资采购面临有钱买不到货，有货运不回国的无力局面。
Overseas defence supplies procurement faced the inability to buy goods, freight not to return to the situation of powerlessness.
另一方面，各部门频频发出关于民间捐赠医疗物资的规定，也令志愿者有些困惑。
On the other hand, various departments frequently issued regulations on the donation of medical supplies by the civilian population, which caused some confusion to the volunteers.
1月底，一线医院再次曝出物资紧缺消息，引发了大众对于红十字会分发物资效率的质疑。
At the end of January, first-line hospitals again reported shortages, raising questions about the efficiency of Red Cross distribution.
在那之后，能不能绕开红十字会直接捐助医院成了志愿者们最关心的问题。
After that, the question of whether to bypass the Red Cross and donate directly to hospitals became a major concern for the volunteers.
根据湖北省红十字会官网公告，湖北省红会按一定标准接收疫情防控相关物资，捐赠方需填写捐赠意向函及产品资质文件接收核查，捐赠意向为定向捐赠的，由捐赠人与受赠单位对接后，直接发货到受赠单位。
According to the official website of the Hubei Red Cross Society, the Hubei Red Cross Society will accept materials related to disease prevention and control according to certain standards. Donors will be required to fill out a letter of intention to donate and receive verification of product qualification documents.
2月7日，武汉市市场监督管理局发文，呼吁爱心人士“尽量通过红十字会统筹实现捐赠，以免绕开红十字定向捐赠后，增加医院查验负担”，“对绕开红十字会直接向有关单位捐赠的防护用品，凡涉嫌违法违规的行为将依法处理。
On February 7, the Wuhan Municipal Market Supervision Authority issued a letter calling on loving people to "coordinate donations through the Red Cross Society so as not to increase the burden of hospital examination by bypassing the Red Cross's targeted donation."
”消息一出，在志愿者间引起轩然大波——很多人担心这意味着民间不能再向医院直接捐助物资。
The news caused a stir among volunteers - many feared it meant people could no longer donate directly to hospitals.
对于武汉市市场监督管理局担忧的“增加医院查验负担”问题，志愿者张科有自己的看法。
For Wuhan City Market Supervision Authority worried about "increase the burden of hospital inspection," volunteers Zhang Ke has their own views.
他表示普通民众辨别标准繁琐的医护物资确实经验不够，但现在很多志愿者群都加入了医护人员，可以线上指导大家采购合规物资，“我们很有组织性条理性，不是打乱仗的”。
He said the general public did not have enough experience in distinguishing between cumbersome standards of care and medical supplies, but now many volunteer groups have joined health care workers to guide you online in purchasing compliance materials. "We are well organized, not disruptive."
同一天，财政部副部长余蔚平在新闻发布会上表示，鼓励社会各界捐赠以缓解医疗物资压力，允许向医院直接捐赠。
On the same day, Vice Finance Minister Yu Weiping said at a press conference that donations from all sectors of the community were encouraged to ease the pressure on medical supplies and allow direct donations to hospitals.
武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部应急保障组曾发布《关于采购或捐赠防疫医用耗材有关事项的公告》，细化了社会捐赠医疗物资的资质要求。
The Emergency Support Group of the Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command has issued the Notice on Purchasing or Donating Medical Consumables for Disease Prevention and Control, specifying the qualification requirements for medical supplies donated by the society.
其中，国产防护产品，需要提供医疗器械注册证和医疗器械生产许可证。
Among them, domestic protection products, need to provide medical device registration certificate and medical device production license.
海外防护产品，需要提供境外医疗器械上市证明文件和检验报告。
Overseas protective products, the need to provide overseas medical equipment listing documents and inspection reports.
但从实际操作角度来看，志愿者在海外采购时发现，大多数国外防护品卖家不能及时或者没有意愿提供齐全的证明文件。
But from an operational point of view, volunteers shopping overseas have found that most foreign protection sellers are unable or unwilling to provide complete documentation in a timely manner.
另外，各国的质量监测体系不同，医疗防护物资存在欧标、美标、韩标等多个执行标准，如何对应成国标是个难题。
In addition, the quality monitoring system varies from country to country, and there are many enforcement standards for medical protective materials, such as European, American and Korean standards.
为了规避风险，一些民间物资捐赠组织选择将证件不齐全，但专业人士鉴定为合规的物资捐给社区、街道、警察等群体。
In order to avoid the risk, some private donation organizations choose to donate goods that are incomplete, but are certified as compliant by professionals, to communities, streets, police, etc.
实际上，由于防护物资紧缺，目前武汉定点医院一线医护人员分配到的部分防护服设备也并不够达标。
In fact, due to the shortage of protective materials, Wuhan Dingdian Hospital first-line health care staff distribution of some protective clothing equipment is not up to standard.
武汉市中心医院和武汉市第一医院医生向记者透露，物资最缺的时候，他们分到的防护衣动作一大就容易破，医护人员会在破损的防护服上“打补丁”，“贴胶布”继续使用。
The doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital and Wuhan First Hospital told reporters that when supplies were in short supply, the protective clothing they were given was easily broken, and medical staff "patched" worn-out suits and "taped" them.
志愿者张科认为，不合规的医护用品流向一线，可能会对医护人员造成伤害隐患，确实是好心办坏事的“涉嫌违法”行为。
Zhang Ke, a volunteer, believes that the flow of substandard medical supplies to the front line, may cause harm to health-care workers, is indeed a "good-hearted evil of the" suspected illegal.
但客观存在物资缺口的情况下，张科希望监管部门对社会捐赠多鼓励、多引导，“可以向社会征集专业人士在医院协助接收物资，或者公开一些官方物资辨别群，通过线上指导大家采购合规物资”。
But with the objective material gap, Zhang hoped that the supervising department would encourage and guide the public donation more. "We can solicit professional help from the society to receive the materials in the hospital, or make some official material identification groups public and guide the procurement of compliance materials online."
