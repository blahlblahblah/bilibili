那些缺氧的患者就像一个人往悬崖上走，路一直是平的，向前走的时候他看不到悬崖，医生也看不到。
The hypoxic sufferer walked along the cliff like a man, the road was always level, and he could not see the cliff as he walked along, nor did the doctor.
等你反应过来，他一只脚已经掉下去了这个肺炎的确是颠覆了这么多年看普通肺炎的经验…… 面对一个崭新的疾病，每个医生积累的所谓经验，都是一个个去世的病人教会我们的本文首发于南方人物周刊文 |本刊记者 杨楠 张明萌编辑| 蒯乐昊全文约5839，细读大约需要13分钟医护人员贴着玻璃给外面的同事看记录的病人情况图 / 受访者提供因为一些意外，采访被推迟到晚上10点半开始。
By the time you respond, one of his feet has fallen. This pneumonia is really upsetting years of common pneumonia... The so-called experience each doctor has accumulated is a new one.
我问姜利要不要换成第二天，她说就今晚吧，明儿是龙抬头，有志愿者会来给医生理发。
I asked Jiang Li whether to change into the next day, she said tonight, tomorrow is the head of the dragon, some volunteers will come to the doctor haircut.
这也是她第一次在“二月二”正日子理发，要珍惜这次机会。
It was the first time she had a haircut on February 2. Cherish the chance.
2月24日，农历二月二，姜利到达武汉整一个月。
February 24, the second lunar month, Jiang Li arrived in Wuhan all month.
她是首都医科大学宣武医院重症医学科主任，也是国家卫健委最早调派支援武汉的专家之一。
She is the director of severe medicine in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University and one of the earliest experts seconded to Wuhan by the National Health Commission.
同姜利的聊天信息量极大，她同时具有临床专家的细致经验和国家级专家的宏观思考。
Her chatting with Jiang Li is extremely informative, and she also has the detailed experience of clinical experts and macroscopic thinking of national experts.
对于过去一个月的危重症抢救，她坦诚告知了她所在的金银潭医院危重症病区的艰难，指出我们目前对新冠肺炎的认识仍有不少局限。
For the past month's critical rescue, she frankly told her that her gold and silver pool hospital critical illness area, pointed out that we still have a lot of limitations on the understanding of the new crown pneumonia.
每一个病人都帮助了人类认识病程发展，有时，这种认识的递进，伴随着惨痛的代价。
Each patient helps humans to understand the course of disease, and sometimes the progression of that awareness comes at a painful cost.
救治新冠病人的关键在于“关口前移”。
The key to the treatment of new crown patients is "pass forward."
姜利的工作内容之一，是去另外三家医院的普通病区巡查，要在普通病人中甄别、筛选出重点病人，尽早干预和治疗。
One of Jiang Li's tasks is to visit three other hospitals in the general area of the disease, screening, screening out key patients, early intervention and treatment.
由于存量太大，这项工作有时比在金银潭重症病房还劳累，但姜利说，这是她特别愿意做的事，因为这是降低死亡率的关键命题。
The work is sometimes more exhausting than in the Gold and Silver Pool Intensive Care Unit because of its large stock, but Jiang says this is something she is particularly willing to do because it is a key issue in reducing mortality.
姜利在巡查其他医院的病房图 / 受访者提供终于能看清前面是悬崖南方人物周刊：您到武汉一个月了，对病情的认识有什么样的变化？姜利：到现在四个星期了，能慢慢明白坚持活下来的病人走的是一条怎样的路。
Jiang Li is inspecting the wards of other hospitals. / The interviewee finally can see clearly that the cliff south personage weekly: You have been in Wuhan for a month, how does the understanding of the disease change? Jiang Li: Now four weeks, I can understand what the road is for the patient who insists on surviving.
第一批病人的病情都比较重，还没搞清楚怎么回事就走掉了，每天都在发生同样的事情。
The first patients were seriously ill and left before they could figure out what was happening. The same thing happened every day.
我们想不能总是这样子，先从工作流程上想办法，把病人管得更细致一些。
We don't think we can do that all the time. We need to find a way out of the workflow and take care of patients more carefully.
金银潭的工作人员来自全国各地，各自分工，要去搞清楚所有的病人非常难。
Gold and Silver Pool staff came from all over the country. It was very difficult to find out all the patients.
一下来了很急的病人，马上就要抢救了，要插管了，甚至来不及去搞明白他是怎么回事，已经病了多久。
A very urgent patient down, will be rescued immediately, to intubation, even to find out how he is, has been sick for a long time.
还有一个非常不方便的地方，这是一个传染病院的病房结构，病人、呼吸机和血气机、静脉泵在里面（污染区）。
There is also a very inconvenient place, this is an infectious disease hospital ward structure, patients, ventilators and blood gas, venous pumps inside (contaminated areas).
药品、化验报告、病历记录、影像学片子在外面（非污染区）。
Drugs, laboratory reports, medical records, imaging films are outside (non-contaminated areas).
平常我们工作，随时可以调看资料，在哪都能看，随便进出，这里不行。
Usually we work, can look at the data at any time, can see anywhere, in and out, not here.
在里头我要想着刚刚在外面看见电脑上记录了什么。
Inside I was thinking about what I'd just seen on the computer outside.
在外面我要想里面的呼吸机我调成什么样了。
Outside I need to figure out what I'm doing with the ventilator inside.
后来我拿一张纸，在外面记录病人的一些基本信息，再拿一张纸写我在里边干了什么。
Then I took a piece of paper and recorded some basic information about the patient outside. Then I took a piece of paper and wrote down what I had done inside.
可是带进去的东西不能带出来，就放在玻璃上让外面的同事拍照传到工作群里。
But the items brought in could not be brought out. They were placed on glass to be photographed by outside colleagues and sent to work.
最开始的时候，针对气管插管的时机有很大的争议，到底插还是不插？那个关键的节点到底是什么。
In the beginning, there was a great deal of controversy over the timing of the trachea cannula, whether it should be inserted or not?
在临床上判断呼吸衰竭程度的一个简单办法，就看他还能不能完整地说出一句话来，我有一个病人始终可以。
A simple way to determine the extent of respiratory failure clinically is to see if he can still say it all in one word. I have a patient who can always do it.
他能喝东西，能看手机，每天都要求喝营养液，就是为了早点好起来，早点回家。
He can drink, can see the mobile phone, every day to drink nutrient solution, is to get well earlier, go home earlier.
你能从他身上看到他想活下去的信念。
You can see in him the belief that he wants to live.
他是一个很壮的中年男人，50岁上下。
He is a strong middle-aged man, about 50 years old.
五六十岁的这拨人是这次被打击得最厉害的那群人。
The group in their fifties and sixties had been the hardest hit.
最早插管这拨病人后面还会出现二氧化碳潴留、高碳酸血症，他身体里的二氧化碳排不出来。
There will be carbon dioxide retention and hypercapnia after the first catheterization, and the carbon dioxide in his body will not come out.
这通常出现在肺炎非常晚期的时候。
This usually occurs in the very late stages of pneumonia.
但这次新冠肺炎更早地出现了这种情况。
But this time it happened earlier in the case of pneumonia.
二氧化碳的潴留，通常用呼吸机来调节会有一定程度的好转，但是这次非常难。
The retention of carbon dioxide, which is usually regulated by a respirator, can be improved to some extent, but this time it is very difficult.
发现病毒还会攻击心肌，这也是一般肺炎没有的。
The virus is also found to attack the heart muscle, which is usually not the case with pneumonia.
并不是说一上来心脏就不工作了，而是到了某个时间，让心脏发挥作用的时候，它会一下子停下来。
It's not that the heart doesn't stop working when it comes up, but it stops at some point, when the heart is working.
你可以这么理解：所有的细胞都受伤了，它在勉强地咬着牙在工作，稍微到临界点就不行了。
You can understand that all the cells are injured, that it is gritting grudgingly at work, and that the tipping point is not enough.
但是病人并不是表现为典型的心衰，最后循环完全崩塌了。
But the patient did not show typical heart failure, and eventually the cycle completely collapsed.
这跟常规的心衰不一样，那种心衰在临床上很典型，可能给一支利尿药就好了。
Unlike conventional heart failure, which is clinically typical, a diuretic may be the answer.
心脏的功能障碍和心肌细胞的损害是不能完全画等号的，新冠肺炎在早期并不表现出心衰。
Cardiac dysfunction and damage to cardiomyocytes cannot be fully identified, and Newcomial Pneumonia does not show heart failure in the early stages.
而是病人每一个细胞都受伤了，但都还在工作，所以心脏的功能还好，可突然到了某一个临界点，每一个细胞就都不工作了。
But every cell of the patient was injured, but they were still working, so the heart functioned well, but suddenly at a critical point, every cell stopped working.
2月24日，武汉，医护人员和家属正在转运一名患者图 / 陈卓南方人物周刊：在重症治疗上有摸到一些规律吗？姜利：我有一位1月18号住院，住院前一周发病的病人，现在还在用呼吸机，已经做了气管切开。
On February 24, Wuhan, medical staff and family members were transferring a patient graph / Chen Zhuo Southern personage week.Jiang Li: I have a patient who was hospitalized on Jan. 18 and had an attack a week before he was hospitalized and is still breathing machine and has had a tracheotomy.
现在病情不乐观。
The situation is not good now.
其实我对于要不要坚持下去有过心理斗争。
In fact, I have psychological struggle whether to persist or not.
来这儿就接了第一波病人，几乎每个都是一进门就抢救，等轮到他的时候，当时心跳已经停了。
Here came the first wave of patients, almost every one of the door on the rescue, waiting for his turn, when the heartbeat had stopped.
那时候人力不够，经常会发生这样的事情。
There was not enough manpower in those days. Such things often happened.
我们给他做了一个紧急插管，但他的脑子已经因为缺氧受损了，即使康复，也多半会成为植物人。
We gave him an emergency intubation, but his brain has been damaged by lack of oxygen, and if he recovers, he will probably be a vegetarian.
上呼吸机的病人，如果不能脱离呼吸机，我们通常会在两周左右的时候做气管切开，但他的问题是可能不会再醒过来了。
A ventilator patient who can't get off the ventilator usually has a tracheotomy about two weeks, but his problem is probably not going to wake up again.
这样气管切开的风险（这是一个高危操作）和患者的获益，就变得不是很清晰了。
The risks of tracheotomy (which is a high-risk operation) and the benefits for patients are thus less clear.
他处于昏迷状态，嘴里插了气管，有一些污秽物。
He was in a coma, had a trachea stuck in his mouth and had some filth.
我帮他做了气管切开，让他多少能舒服一点。
I made him a tracheotomy to make him more or less comfortable.
那这个病人在医生来看，并不是说做了这个救治就能活，在伦理和道义上的考虑会更多一点。
The fact that the patient was seen by the doctor did not mean that he would be able to live with this treatment, and that there would be a little more ethical and moral consideration.
以我现在的认知再去诊断，可能会更早插管。
With my current knowledge to diagnose, I might have intubation earlier.
当他还只是肺坏掉的时候，我努力把肺搞定。
When he was just losing his lungs, I tried to take care of them.
一旦出了其他的问题，比如肾脏坏掉了，比如说循环出现问题，病情会一泻千里很难拽住。
Once something else goes wrong, like a broken kidneys, for example, a circulatory problem, it can be very difficult to hold back.
治疗难度一下就高了，这不是1+1=2的关系。
This is not a 1 + 1 = 2 relationship.
刚开始我们看待这个病的历程，那些低氧的患者就像一个人往悬崖上走，路一直是平的，向前走的时候他看不到悬崖，医生也看不到。
At first we looked at the disease, the hypoxia patients like a person to walk on the cliff, the road has always been flat, when he walked forward he can not see the cliff, and the doctor can not see.
等你反应过来，他一只脚已经掉下去了。
By the time you respond, one of his feet has fallen.
现在我们终于学习着能看清前面多远是悬崖，知道再这么走就会掉下去。
Now we finally learn to see how far ahead is a cliff, knowing that if we walk this way, we will fall.
但只是了解了它的发生、发展，还没能够学会迅速阻断某个环节的进展。
But only understand its occurrence, development, has not been able to learn to quickly block the progress of a link.
作为医生，我们目前只能监控着他往前走，判断他快要掉下去的时候，把他往上托一托，看看能不能托住，也许有些人就托住了。
As doctors, we can only monitor his progress, judge that he is about to fall, lift him up, and see if we can hold him, and perhaps some will hold him.
南方人物周刊：如果知道最后一定会掉下去的话，为什么还要托他？姜利：一些时候并不知道最后会怎样。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: If you know you're going to end up falling, why trust him? Jiang Li: Sometimes I don't know what will happen.
另一些时候，那些已经走到一半的人，像刚才的例子，如果病人最终不能活下来，我希望他能有尊严地离开。
At other times, those who have reached the halfway mark, as in the case just now, if the patient does not survive, I want him to leave with dignity.
这也是一个医生的职责。
It is also the duty of a doctor.
如果医生判断说这个人一定不行，比如说病人既往的生活质量也不好，或者他年纪非常大了，有很多伴随疾病的，这种病人我也主张不要太过积极地插管。
If the doctor decides that this person must not be able, say, the patient's previous quality of life is not good, or he is very old, there are many diseases, this patient I also advocate not too active intubation.
前两天有两个老奶奶，快80岁了，进来时肺两边就都白了。
The other day there were two old women, nearly 80 years old, who came in with their lungs white.
其中一个，肺部情况那么差，进一步的治疗带来的痛苦可能远远大于好处。
In one, the lungs are in such bad shape that further treatment can be far more painful than good.
等她病情恶化的时候，护士问了我两遍，我说你可以不用做临终复苏了，就让她这样安静地走。
When her illness worsened, the nurse asked me twice, and I said you could walk quietly without a last-minute resuscitation.
奶奶很快出现了昏迷，我给了她一点升血压的药，维持病人的循环，直到最后。
Grandma soon fell into a coma and I gave her a blood pressure-boosting medication to keep the patient circulating until the end.
第二个奶奶是我自己给气管插的管。
The second grandma was the tube I plugged into the trachea.
我进去查房的时候觉得她不好，因为时间紧急，赶紧准备东西插管。
When I went in to check the room, I thought she was not good, because the time is urgent, hurry to prepare things intubation.
插完管之后我在那呆了有一个多小时，很艰难地去调呼吸机，病人状态稍稍稳定了。
I stayed there for more than an hour after the tube was inserted. I had a difficult time adjusting the ventilator. The patient's condition stabilized a little.
但从病房出来之后我再看一片子，我就发现这管多半白插了，因为那片子太糟糕了。
But when I came out of the ward and looked at another piece, I saw that the tube was mostly useless because it was too bad.
我自己的观点，这有点像就像战争。
From my own point of view, it's sort of like war.
在战场上救治原则是，优先救治能够迅速恢复战斗力的士兵。
The principle of battlefield medical treatment is to give priority to soldiers who can quickly regain combat effectiveness.
医疗资源有限的时候，也要对资源的恰当使用进行审慎的评估。
When medical resources are limited, a careful assessment of the proper use of resources is also required.
南方人物周刊：危重死亡率，现在有改变吗？姜利：不同疾病严重程度的患者，死亡率肯定是不同的。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: Critical Mortality, Is There a Change Now? Jiang Li: The mortality rate must be different for people with different degrees of severity of disease.
按照我所在的病区，死亡率是很高的。
According to the area I live in, the death rate is high.
最终把大家的数字汇总，可能会得到比较客观的答案。
Finally, aggregate your figures and you may get a more objective answer.
我觉得真实的病死率大概在现在没有人能够准确统计出来，分子和分母都不是完全的准确。
I think the true mortality rate is probably no one can accurately calculate today, the numerator and denominator are not completely accurate.
2月13日，武汉金银潭医院，医护人员正在ICU内忙碌图 / 陈卓我特别愿意每天去所有的普通病区走一圈，把那些快要出问题的病人挑出来南方人物周刊：怎样才能更好地救治危重病人呢？姜利：这是一个整体的工程，先要想办法把病人输入到医院里，初步问题解决之后，才有可能让“关口前移”，危重病人的抢救也需要“关口前移”，让普通病房的病人不到那么糟糕的时候才过来。
2007-3-1 15: 23 2007-11-13 15: 23 2007-11-13 15: 16 2007-11-13 15: 19 2007-11-13 22: 19 2007-11-19 15: 19 2007-11-19 15: 19 2007-11-19 15: 19 2007-11-19 15: 19 2007-11-19 15: 19 2007-11-19 19: 23
这个情况最近慢慢在好转了。
This situation is gradually improving recently.
如果前面的那一层能够提早，我们这一层再及时往前提，病人只要撑住了就有机会。
If the front layer can be early, our level of timely to the premise, as long as the patient has a chance.
那天他们问我想干什么，我说我最想干的事情是你让我到方舱里去，我来筛查，或者你让我到普通病房，我帮你筛人，我就凭我的眼睛、我的经验，把可能的重症尽量转走，他需要更高的医护。
The other day they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said that the thing I most wanted to do was you let me go into the cabin, I screened, or you sent me to the general ward, and I sifted for you.
我特别愿意做的事情就是每天去所有的普通病区都走一圈，把那些看着快要出问题的病人挑出来，有机会能够进到ICU里得到照顾。
What I especially like to do is walk around all the common areas every day and single out patients who are having trouble getting access to the ICU.
那天有一个病人，我跟他们说再不处理，可能他下个小时就没了，我一眼就能看出来。
There was a patient that day, and I told them not to deal with it, maybe he would be gone the next hour, and I could see it at a glance.
他意识是不是不太清楚？他呼吸是不是特别快？他呼吸的时候是不是特别费力？他心率是不是也很快？血压也掉下来了，指脉氧也掉下来了。
Was he not aware of it? Was he breathing very fast? Was he breathing with great difficulty? Was his heart rate also fast? Blood pressure fell and his finger oxygen fell.
这些都是他已经走到悬崖边上的表征，稍微一松就下去了。
These were the signs that he had come to the edge of the cliff, and went down with a slight slackening.
我今天把几次巡检的名单一条一条捋清楚了，整理出大概那么一个可能有二十来人的名单。
Today, I sorted through the list of people I visited a few times and sorted out a list of about twenty people.
我说咱们再去一下其他院区，简单看一下，每个病区就没有那么多人。
I said let's go back to the other campuses and take a brief look at the fact that there aren't so many people in each ward.
诊疗指南上不是区分了重症和危重症吗？但实际上，对于临床操作来说，是动态的，可能病人上个小时是重症，下个小时就危重症了，我今天去看，有好几个危重症的病人，都已经好转又回到重症了。
The guidelines do not distinguish between severe and critical cases, but in practice, they are dynamic for clinical practice. The patient may have had a severe illness last hour, but the next hour is critical. I went to see several critically ill patients who have recovered and returned to serious illness.
重症病人的救治，跟他所在医院的医疗设备有关系，比如说有没有呼吸机，氧压够不够，还跟人员配备有关系，像我们这里，再多一倍的医护人员其实都是不够的。
Seriously ill patients have to do with the medical equipment in his hospital, like breathing machines, oxygen pressure, and staffing, and twice as many paramedics here as we do.
还有一个非常大的影响因素，就是医护人员的勇气与担当，在面临感染风险这件事情上，人和人的差异不小。
There is also a very large impact on the courage and commitment of medical staff, in the face of the risk of infection, people and people are not small differences.
南方人物周刊：主观的部分在ICU抢救里面有多重要？姜利：现在有两个问题，一个是人手配备的确不够，我再加一倍的护士，让每个护士负责现在1/2的工作，质量会好一些。
How important is the subjective part in the ICU salvage? Jiang Li: Now there are two problems. One is that the staff is really not enough.
另一个医护人员还需要继续克服恐惧心理。
Another health care worker needs to continue to overcome fear.
每一个ICU病人能活下来，都是靠一个班一个班接力的。
Every ICU patient survives by a class-by-class relay.
如果有一个班做得不好，会把前面很多班的工作全都倒回去。
If one class does not do well, it will reverse the work of many of the previous classes.
南方人物周刊：现在不同医院救治水平之间的差异大吗？姜利：不小。
Southern Personality Weekly: Is there a big difference in the level of treatment between different hospitals? Jiang Li: Not small.
平常在北京，各个医院的ICU，同一家医院里不同的ICU都有很大的差别。
Usually in Beijing, each hospital ICU, the same hospital in different ICU are very different.
而且现在有一些医疗外的因素在互相影响，比如说一个病区由三支医疗队拼起来，大家的思路也不一定一样。
And now there are extrinsic factors influencing each other, such as the fact that three medical teams are working together in one area, and the thinking is not always the same.
客观上，大家的治疗习惯、平常工作习惯都不一样，以及对这个新疾病的认识有一个过程。
Objectively, everyone's treatment habits, common work habits are different, and there is a process of understanding the new disease.
姜利在金银潭南六楼ICU病区工作 图/ 受访者提供医生认识这个疾病发生发展过程的代价巨大南方人物周刊：一些医生指出，有一些患者可能肺的CT影像已经全白了，他就是重症，甚至危重症，但他能走能吃还能跟你说话，看起来似乎一切正常，为什么会有这样的现象？姜利：对，很奇怪。
Some doctors have pointed out that some patients may have already received CT images of their lungs. He is seriously ill or even critically ill, but he can walk, eat and talk to you. It looks as if everything is OK.
我们不是叫急性呼吸窘迫综合征吗？但有些病人不窘迫。
Aren't we called acute respiratory distress syndrome? But some patients are not embarrassed.
按说氧低成那样的时候，应该喘得很厉害才对，可是现在患者闲庭信步玩手机。
When oxygen is low like that, you should be gasping hard, but now the patient is sitting around playing with his cell phone.
我猜测是因为人体的反馈机制被破坏了，真是挺不好理解的。
My guess is that the feedback mechanism of the body is broken, which is really hard to understand.
这个肺炎的确是颠覆了这么多年看普通肺炎的经验。
This pneumonia is indeed a reversal of so many years of common pneumonia experience.
我记得以前有一个研究，在珠峰上，人的氧分压是极低的，大概只有26。
I remember a previous study in which the oxygen pressure on Mount Everest was extremely low, about 26.
因为空气里的氧就低，说明人体对低氧的代偿耐受能力非常强。
Because the oxygen in the air is low, the human body to compensate for the oxygen is very strong tolerance.
如果这个人仅仅是低氧，并不会马上死掉。
If the person is merely hypoxic, he does not die immediately.
一般来说在低氧的时候，会有一些反射发生，受体感知到，让患者用喘来代偿。
In general, when oxygen is low, some reflexes occur and the receptor is felt, allowing the patient to gasp for compensation.
也许人体的这个代偿机制这次被病毒破坏了。
Perhaps this compensation mechanism of the human body was destroyed by the virus this time.
南方人物周刊：也有案例是已经从重症转出去了，但患者觉得自己不舒服，要求重新拍CT，发现肺部病情加重了。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: There have also been cases of patients who have been transferred out of critical condition, but feel ill and ask for a retake of the CT to find that the lung condition has worsened.
姜利：人感觉不舒服，是一个非常复杂、由多重因素共同形成的感觉，低氧只是其中一方面。
Jiang Li: Feeling uncomfortable is a very complex feeling formed by many factors. Hypoxia is only one of them.
一般来说，我宁愿相信病人的感受，反过来也是这样，我判断一个人病是不是好了，会问他“你觉得怎么样？”如果他觉得有力气了，说话声音洪亮，脸色放光了，眼神也灵动了，他就是好了。
In general, I'd rather believe a patient's feelings, and vice versa, and I judge if a person is well, and ask him, "What do you think?" If he feels strong, speaks loudly, looks glowing, and his eyes move, he's all right.
南方人物周刊：您抢救到现在有哪些印象比较深的病人？姜利：其实所有人我都还记得。
Southern Personality Weekly: What kind of patients do you have in mind so far? Jiang Li: Actually, I remember all of them.
医生认识这个疾病发生发展的过程，代价是一条一条的生命。
Doctors understand how the disease develops, at the cost of life after life.
南方人物周刊：您在这一个月里比以前更高密度地面对死亡吗？姜利：这倒不是，而是面临很多意外的死亡。
CHANDLEY: Are you facing death more intensively this month than ever before? Jiang Li: It's not, it's a lot of accidental deaths.
死亡不会按照计划来。
Death doesn't go according to plan.
有一些病人根本就托不住，他会走，这种病人我们该做的事情都做了，只能让他走。
There are patients who simply can't support, he will go, this kind of patient we should do all the things, can only let him go.
有的病人能够托住，你明确地知道这个病人在每个相应的病情阶段应该怎么处理，并且把这些事情都做了，尽量托住，托住他可能就有机会，但他最后还是走了。
You know exactly what to do with the patient at each stage of the illness, and you do it all, holding him as long as you can, but he finally left.
可不管怎样，为病人赢得一些时间，可能病情就会好转。
Anyhow, buy the patient some time and it may get better.
我们希望减少意外死亡，大部分情况下，医生可以预判。
We want to reduce the number of accidental deaths, and in most cases, doctors can predict.
但也有一些病人，走的那天医生就没看出来，或者第二天才知道这个病人去世了，我们要想办法减少这样的现象。
But there were patients who didn't see it the day they left, or who didn't know the patient was dead until the next day.
南方人物周刊：这对你来说会有冲击吗？姜利：会非常遗憾。
SOUTHERN PEOPLE WEEKLY: Will it have an impact on you? Jiang Li: It would be very regrettable.
我们日常的工作是不大愿意或者不大允许这样的事情发生。
Our daily job is to be reluctant or unwilling to allow such things to happen.
医生没有主观上做错什么，但会有认识的不足，这就是代价。
Doctors do not subjectively do anything wrong, but there will be a lack of understanding, and that is the price.
面对一个崭新的疾病，每个医生积累的所谓经验，都是一个个去世的病人教会我们的。
In the face of a new disease, every doctor's accumulated so-called experience, one after another of the deceased patients taught us.
2月17日，武汉市红会医院重症隔离病区，医护人员正在救治一位重症患者 图 / 陈卓诊断时核酸可能是假阴性，为什么出去的时候不能也是假阴性？南方人物周刊：现在面对病情，因为还有很多未知的部分，有认知的难度，这种难度会让你觉得沮丧吗？姜利：没有让我沮丧，工作的方式是在变化的。
Feb. 17, Wuhan Red Cross Hospital severe isolation area, medical staff are treating a critically ill patient chart / Chen Zhuo diagnosis may be false negative nucleic acids, why not go out also false negative?
但也有一个问题是，并没有一个最高的部门能够调配所有的部门所有的人，所以省与省之间、医疗队之间的人员没有流动。
However, there is also the problem that there is no single highest authority capable of deploying all the people in all sectors, so there is no movement of personnel between provinces and medical teams.
其实ICU最核心的宗旨就是集中一批医生、一批护士、一批设备，医生护士学会用这个设备，他们才有专业的知识，再集中救治下一批重病人。
In fact, the core purpose of the ICU is to assemble a group of doctors, nurses, a batch of equipment, doctors and nurses learned to use this equipment, they have the professional knowledge, and focus on the next batch of seriously ill patients.
当然现在慢慢在好转，这两天我们在做巡访，目的就是把这些潜在的重症病人全捞出来，放到一个更好的医院去。
Now, of course, we're slowly getting better. We're on a two-day tour to get these potentially serious patients out and put them in a better hospital.
其实需要的是梳理出一个好的工作流程，但是这个挺难的，在金银潭我们一个病区都梳理了很久。
What is needed is to sort out a good workflow, but this is very difficult, in the gold and silver pool we have been combing a long time.
南方人物周刊：您觉得金银潭现在的ICU在设备的配置够吗？姜利：比上不足，比下有余。
Do you think the ICU in the Gold and Silver Pool is equipped with enough equipment? Jiang Li: More than enough.
很多医院没有呼吸机，或者呼吸机非常少。
Many hospitals do not have ventilators, or very few.
所以他们可能就不能阻止患者病情的恶化。
So they may not be able to stop their patients from getting worse.
你算算现在有多少新冠肺炎病人在医院里面。
You figure out how many new cases of pneumonia are in the hospital now.
所有这些病人对氧气的需求是共同的。
All these patients have a common need for oxygen.
南方人物周刊：现在有一些案例，治愈出院后又检测核酸呈阳性，您觉得比较可能的原因是什么？姜利：我们对这个病毒的认识还远远不够，通过尸检来说，病毒生存的时间比我们想象的要长，所以我一直觉得应该人出去之后再给他找个地方，隔离两个礼拜，但是我也知道，这会造成很大的社会负担，你想这所有人之前先圈了一阵，生病跑医院来，好不容易出去了，整个过程在医院差不多要将近一个月的时间，第1个星期隐匿，第2个星期症状明显，第3个星期如果好了的话，也不会马上健步如飞。
What do you think is the most likely reason why we still don't know enough about the virus, but I always thought it would take us a while to find a place for him to live in isolation for two weeks.But I thought it would take almost a month to get out of the hospital, the first week to disappear, the third week to do so.
所以一般来说整个病程大概要3周到4周，好不容易从这儿出去了，你再给他来两星期，还得找地方安放……既然你在诊断的时候，核酸就可能是假阴性，你为什么出去的时候不能也是假阴性？南方人物周刊：您倾向于认为出院的时候他没有完全治愈。
So generally it takes about three weeks and four weeks to get out of here, you give him another two weeks, and you have to find someplace to put it... since when you diagnose nucleic acids may be false-negative, why can't you go out and be false-negative?
姜利：肺炎影像学完全吸收是比较慢的，大多数人影子会一直在。
Jiang Li: Pneumonia radiology absorbs completely is relatively slow, most people's shadow will always be there.
一般来说我们讲什么样的情况下肺炎出院？不发烧了，低氧血症纠正了，呼吸困难没有了，病人自觉都好了，通常是这样就出院了。
In general, we talk about the circumstances of discharge from the hospital pneumonia? No fever, hypoxemia corrected, dyspnea is no longer, the patient is self-conscious and is usually discharged.
但是这次肺炎咱们是不是没摸清楚规律？我觉得应该找一些这种符合现在出院标准的（假阴性）案例，去研究一下他们身上到底还带不带毒。
But I think we should find some of these (false-negative) cases that now meet the criteria for discharge and see if they're still drug-free.
这里面有太多的东西值得认真地去研究。
There is so much to study.
