病毒可以很快消除，但是消除种族歧视的路还很长。
The virus could be eliminated quickly, but there was still a long way to go to eliminate racial discrimination.
困难固然艰巨，但每个中国人都该做点什么。
Difficult as it is, every Chinese should do something about it.
记　者 | 吴　雪受访者 |艾米尔我是黎巴嫩大学博士学院的中国访问学者艾米尔，本科毕业于上海外国语大学东方语学院阿拉伯语专业，去年9月份来到黎巴嫩时，和当地朋友一起住在舒夫县的沙希姆镇小镇上。
I am a visiting Chinese scholar at Lebanese University's PhD School. I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Arabic at Shanghai Foreign Languages University's School of Oriental Languages. When I arrived in Lebanon last September, I lived with local friends in the small town of Shahim, in Shuf County.
半年来，我生活得一直很快乐。
I have been living a happy life for half a year.
2月上旬，黎巴嫩媒体开始对中国新冠肺炎疫情进行报道，并大肆渲染恐慌情绪，部分黎巴嫩民众对像我一样长着东亚面孔的人，都不是很友好。
Early in February, the Lebanese media began to report on the outbreak of pneumonia in China, spreading panic, and some Lebanese people were not very friendly to people like me with an East Asian face.
记得有一次，我走在贝鲁特的大街上，旁边开车的人疾驰而过，看到我时竟然朝着我大喊了一句“Kurūnā”，这个词在阿拉伯语中是新冠病毒的意思。
I remember walking down a Beirut street once when a motorist sped by and yelled at me, "Kurūna ān," which means the new crown virus in Arabic.
出门遭遇这种歧视性的侮辱，我一开始并没有放在心上，很生气的话，会冲过去找他人当面对质，对方解释说“自己在玩笑话，别当真”。
At first I didn't pay attention to this discriminatory insult. When I was angry, I would run over and have a face-to-face confrontation.
我清楚这并不代表所有黎巴嫩人的想法。
I am aware that this does not represent the thinking of all Lebanese.
艾米尔在黎巴嫩留学　受访者供图但让我心寒的是，每当我找同学借东西，或走在路上碰到同学的时候，他们会不自觉地躲得远远的，并向我投来异样的目光。
Emil offered pictures to the interviewees in Lebanon, but to my dismay, every time I borrow something from my classmates or walk along the road, they will hide away and give me a strange look.
我虽然能理解他们的害怕，但这种歧视三番五次地出现在我的生活中，我也不愿意再沉默。
Although I can understand their fear, but this kind of discrimination in my life time and again, I do not want to remain silent.
某天，我从贝鲁特乘坐大巴车返回居住的黎巴嫩山省，在车里刚刚坐定，一个黎巴嫩市民上了车，看了我一眼，用调侃的语气讲了一句话：“今天‘新冠病毒’和我们一起坐车回山上。
The other day, as I was returning to Mount Lebanon from Beirut by bus, a Lebanese citizen got into his car, looked at me and said in a sarcastic voice: 'Today New Crown Virus is riding with us back up the hill.
”看到我和他一站下车，那人又不屑地讲了一遍：“‘新冠病毒’和我们一起下车了。
When he saw me get off the bus with him, the man repeated with disdain: 'New Crown Virus' got off with us.
”我当即找他对质：“你说谁是病毒？麻烦你再说一遍？”对方知道我会阿拉伯语后，吓得不敢说话，我非常严肃地告诉他：“我们中国人不是病毒，请你不要再拿这件事开玩笑。
I immediately confronted him and said, "Who do you think is the virus? Could you say that again?" Knowing that I could speak Arabic, I told him very seriously, "We Chinese are not viruses.
”回到家后，当地朋友听了事件的过程，对我表示抱歉，他说这不是黎巴嫩人的想法。
When I got home, my local friend heard about the incident and apologized to me, saying it wasn't Lebanese.
黎巴嫩街头的民众沙希姆镇的人口不多，作为唯一的中国人，当地居民肯定都已经认识我了。
The population of the Lebanese street town of Shaheem is small. As the only Chinese, the local people must already know me.
他们明知我与新冠病毒毫无瓜葛，还说出这样歧视性的话语，我实在没办法接受。
They knew I had nothing to do with the new crown virus, and said such discriminatory words that I couldn't accept.
而在社交媒体上我也看到过许多华人朋友，多少都遭遇过类似的歧视。
On social media, I've seen many Chinese friends who have experienced more or less the same sort of discrimination.
2月27日，我有了一个初步的想法，准备录制一段“反对新冠病毒歧视”的视频，发布在“脸书”上，为中国人正名。
On Feb. 27, I had a preliminary idea to record a video on Facebook, titled "Against New Crown Virus Discrimination," to justify the Chinese.
拍摄视频的地点就在我朋友家的屋顶。
The location of the video was on the roof of my friend's house.
那天，我对着镜头，请黎巴嫩人将心比心，能够正确看待新冠肺炎，不要仅仅出于焦虑和未知的恐惧，就对中国人抱有歧视。
The other day, I looked into the camera and asked the Lebanese to put the new crown pneumonia in perspective and not to discriminate against the Chinese just out of anxiety and fear of the unknown.
Play艾米尔制作视频破除偏见，“走红”阿拉伯国家我知道有些人会说“新冠病毒”是在开玩笑，但这并不好笑，为了让他们更加明白，我还打了一个比方，“如果你的母亲生病了，我可以拿她开玩笑吗？不可以。
Play Emil makes videos to break prejudice and "hit the big Arab countries" I know some people will say the new crown virus is a joke, but that's not funny, but to make them understand it better, I used the analogy, "If your mother is sick, can I joke about her? No."
中国就是我们中国人的母亲，她现在生病了，我们希望她尽快痊愈”。
China is our Chinese mother. She is ill now. We hope she will get well soon. "
我做这个视频的目的，第一是让出门在外的中国人，不会被人说三道四；第二希望黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家的民众意识到，这些歧视性的话语只会损害民众间的感情，不利于中黎两国关系的发展。
I do this video, the first is to let the Chinese people outside the home, will not be criticized, and the second hope that the people of Lebanon and other Arab countries will realize that these discriminatory words will only hurt the feelings of the people and the development of bilateral relations between China and Lebanon.
视频发出后，短短2天内我的脸书账号就已经被浏览了5万余次。
Since the video was released, my Facebook account has been viewed more than 50,000 times in just two days.
与此同时，几位黎巴嫩人将它转到了当地的一些小媒体上，之后一家总部在阿联酋的媒体“Al-Hadath”在6点档的晚间新闻播出了这段视频。
At the same time, several Lebanese transferred it to small local media outlets, after which Al-Hadath, a United Arab Emirates-based media outlet, broadcast the video on the 6 p.m. evening news.
艾米尔接受Al-Jadeed电视台采访　受访者供图之后，黎巴嫩三大主要电视频道之一的Al-Jadeed以及几家黎巴嫩新闻网站不仅采访了我，还请我去录制电视节目。
Al-Jadeed, one of Lebanon's three major television channels, and several Lebanese news websites not only interviewed me, but also asked me to record television programmes, after Emil gave interviews to interviewees on Al-Jadeed television.
2月29日，黎巴嫩议会议员比拉勒·阿卜杜拉（Bilal Abdallah）看到这则视频后，邀请我去他家做客，并一起录制了访谈视频。
On February 29, Lebanese member Bilal Abdallah, seeing the video, invited me to visit his home and recorded an interview video with him.
议员对我表示同情，并呼吁黎巴嫩民众停止因新冠肺炎疫情而歧视中国人，号召黎巴嫩支持中国抗击新冠疫情。
Members of Parliament expressed sympathy for me and called on the Lebanese people to stop discriminating against the Chinese for the New Crown Pneumonia and on Lebanon to support China in its fight against the New Crown.
沙特阿拉比亚电视台对这一互动事件进行了直播。
This interactive event was broadcast live on Saudi Arabian television.
阿拉比亚电视台节目截图　受访者供图王克俭大使与阿卜杜拉议员的互动　受访者供图比拉勒·阿卜杜拉议员在黎巴嫩很有影响力，他拍了视频传到了推特上，很快引发了大量关注。
Abia TV program screeners for interactive interviews with Ambassador Kwim Tu Kwan and Member of Parliament Abdullah For the influential role of Member of Parliament Tubilal Abdullah in Lebanon, he filmed the video and posted it on Twitter, where it quickly caught a lot of attention.
值得注意的是，中国驻黎巴嫩大使王克俭也转发了这一视频，并感谢阿卜杜拉议员反对因新冠病毒歧视中国人的立场。
It is worth noting that Chinese Ambassador to Lebanon, Wang Kejian, also forwarded the video and thanked Member of Parliament Abdullah for his opposition to discrimination against Chinese for the new crown virus.
包括之前埃及歧视中国人的事件，当地的电视台也播出了我的视频，我感觉他们把我当成了中东地区“反歧视第一人”。
Including the discrimination against the Chinese in Egypt and my video on local television, I feel they see me as the "first anti-discrimination man" in the Middle East.
我一下子成了“网红”，被大众所熟知。
I suddenly became the "net red", known to the public.
3月1日，我接到了一份特别的邀请，来自黎巴嫩青年Adham Alsayed，他是一位在武汉求学的华中科技大学在读博士。
On 1 March, I received a special invitation from Adham Alsayed, a young Lebanese student studying in Wuhan at the University of Central China Science and Technology.
他在中国生活了5年，接受过上百家国内外媒体的采访。
He has lived in China for five years and has been interviewed by hundreds of foreign and domestic media.
疫情暴发后，Adham Alsayed主动选择留在武汉。
After the outbreak, Adham Alsayed voluntarily chose to remain in Wuhan.
用自己的所见所闻，向阿拉伯人和世界讲述中国抗疫的能力和魄力，并向世界传递一个真实的中国。
To tell the Arabs and the world about China's capacity and courage to fight the plague and to convey to the world a true China.
艾米尔受邀到黎巴嫩在华留学生Adham Alsayed家中做客　受访者供图他打来电话，告诉我，想邀请我去自己在黎巴嫩的家中做客、共进午餐。
Emil was invited to visit Adham Alsayed, a Lebanese student in China, as a guest at his home. He called me and told me that he wanted to invite me to my home in Lebanon for lunch.
Adham Alsayed的家人十分热情好客，对中国人特别友好。
Adham Alsayed's family are very hospitable and very friendly to the Chinese people.
我在Adham Alsayed家受到了热情款待，还品尝了炸鱼、手抓鸡肉饭等当地美食。
I received a warm reception at Adham Alsayed's and tasted local delicacies such as fish, chicken and rice.
他的家人对我受到歧视性的语言和不友好的行为，表示抱歉，他们很难过，让我不要放在心上，并对我的“反歧视行动”表示了支持。
His family, sorry for the discriminatory language and unfriendly behaviour, told me not to take it to heart and expressed their support for my "affirmative action."
事实上，黎巴嫩人民向来对中国客人非常友善。
In fact, the Lebanese people have always been very friendly to Chinese guests.
后来我就读的黎巴嫩大学，校长福阿德·阿尤布（Fouad Ayoub）也发表了声明，就中国留学生因新冠肺炎疫情遭到该校学生或其他黎巴嫩民众的歧视一事表示歉意，称这些歧视性的举动是个人行为，不能反映全体黎巴嫩人民的道德水准。
The head of my Lebanese university, Fouad Ayoub, also issued a statement apologizing for the discrimination that Chinese students had suffered at the school or other Lebanese citizens because of the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown, saying that such discriminatory actions were personal and did not reflect the moral standards of the entire Lebanese people.
福阿德·阿尤布还接见了所有黎大的中国留学生和中文教师，支持中国抗疫。
Fouad Ayub also received all Chinese students and Chinese teachers from the University of Lebanon to support China's fight against the disease.
此外，黎巴嫩最大在野党——前总理萨阿德·哈里里领导的未来运动则号召民众切勿将新冠病毒政治化。
Moreover, Lebanon's largest opposition party, the Future Movement, led by former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, has called on citizens not to politicize the new crown virus.
黎巴嫩大学校长福阿德·阿尤布接见黎大中国留学生和中文教师　受访者供图这件事后，我发现自己的力量虽然渺小，但还是可以改变周围人的。
When Fouad Ayub, the Rector of the Lebanese University, met with Chinese students and Chinese teacher interviewees at Li Da, I found that although my strength was small, I could change the people around me.
留学生和华人华侨的生活情况有所改变——首先我们对自己更有自信，敢于外出了；其次当地人对亚洲面孔也多了份尊重。
The lives of foreign students and overseas Chinese have changed - first, we feel more confident about ourselves and dare to go out; secondly, the locals have become more respectful of Asian faces.
虽然黎巴嫩人在脸书上也表达过自己对疫情的恐慌，但现实中大家的防护意识还远远不够。
Although the Lebanese have expressed their fears about the outbreak on Facebook, the reality is that people's awareness of prevention is far from enough.
同住的当地朋友一家对新冠肺炎的态度就不是很重视，我让他们戴口罩、勤洗手、多消毒。
The attitude of my local friends and family towards the new crown pneumonia was not taken seriously. I made them wear masks, wash their hands frequently and disinfect more.
但在黎巴嫩人的文化理念里，只有生病的人才戴口罩，所以街上戴口罩的人非常少。
But in Lebanese culture, only the sick wear masks, so the number of people wearing masks on the streets is very low.
而且，正常的家庭聚会、周五穆斯林主麻礼拜和周日基督徒教会礼拜都还在正常进行。
Moreover, normal family gatherings, Friday prayers at the Muslim main house and Sunday services at the Christian church are still normal.
围坐在公园里晒太阳的人们，似乎并未受到影响但最近几天，有了一点变化，出门戴口罩的人比例多了一些，黎巴嫩手机运营商的标语改成“stay home”，贝鲁特沿海的人行道，徒步的人群，也被警察用大喇叭赶回家了。
Those sitting around the park basking in the sun do not seem to have been affected, but in recent days there has been a slight change in the proportion of people going out wearing masks, the change in the slogan of the Lebanese mobile phone operator to "day home," the sidewalks along the Beirut coast and the hikers, who were also driven home by police horns.
在黎巴嫩，只有一家公立医院免费收治新冠肺炎患者，其余私立医院都要自费15万黎镑（约合600元人民币）核酸检测费用，这对于民众来说负担挺大的。
In Lebanon, there is only one public hospital that provides free treatment for patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia, and the rest of the private hospitals pay their own way for LBP 150,000 (about Rmb600) for nucleic acid testing, which is very burdensome for the population.
原本我的公派是到5月份结束的，现在学业是否受影响或者延期，只能等通知。
My official mission ended in May, and now I have to wait to be informed if my studies are affected or postponed.
我现在大部分时间都在家看书、整理资料，为研究课题做准备。
I now spend most of my time reading at home, organizing my material and preparing for my research.
我研究的课题是“一带一路”背景下中国和黎巴嫩经贸关系发展研究，课题方面可能会被导师“催进度”。
My research is on the development of economic and trade relations between China and Lebanon in the context of "One Belt, One Road".
艾米尔接受黎巴嫩最大网络媒体Yasour的采访　受访者供图当地时间21日黎巴嫩总理哈桑·迪亚卜确认，黎巴嫩新冠肺炎确诊总人数已上升为230人，当天晚间，黎巴嫩安全部队介入并采取强制措施，禁止居民外出和集会。
Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab confirmed Tuesday that the total number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in Lebanon had risen to 230, and Lebanese security forces intervened late that day and imposed a ban on residents travelling and gathering.
黎巴嫩进入新冠肺炎疫情暴发期。
Lebanon enters the outbreak of new crown pneumonia.
这场疫情暴露出来了很多问题，比如种族主义，对华歧视等。
The epidemic has exposed many problems, such as racism and discrimination against China.
病毒可以很快消除，但是消除种族歧视的路还很长。
The virus could be eliminated quickly, but there was still a long way to go to eliminate racial discrimination.
困难固然艰巨，但每个中国人都该做点什么。
Difficult as it is, every Chinese should do something about it.
