“我要承担自己的责任，好好照顾家人，把这个家像捏面粉一样捏起来。
"I will assume my responsibility to take good care of my family and pinch the house like flour.
”全文5358字，阅读约需10.5分钟2月13日，余华离开医院、回到家中，多日未相见的女儿想念妈妈，张开双手要一个抱抱，余华硬下心肠拒绝了——这个拥抱还要延期14天，好在不是遥遥无期。
On Feb. 13, Yu Hua left the hospital and returned home. Her daughter, whom she had not seen for days, missed her mother, held her arms out for a hug, which he refused with a cold shoulder.
“新冠”疫情蔓延近三个月，阴影逐渐淡去。
The "new crown" epidemic spread for nearly three months, the shadow gradually faded.
2月18日，全国新增出院病例数首次超过新增确诊病例数，越来越多的患者走出隔离病房，得以直接沐浴阳光。
On February 18, the number of new hospital discharges nationwide exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for the first time, and more and more patients left the isolation ward to take direct baths in the sun.
疾病带来的伤痛，比疾病本身更难消退。
The pain of disease is harder to undo than the disease itself.
郁华痊愈出院，家中却无人迎接他的归来——老伴在照顾他时被感染，正在医院接受治疗；弓露将自己关进“小黑屋”，躺在父亲曾躺过的床上、看着父亲留下的书籍和乐器，遗憾自己从不曾告诉父亲，“你是我的偶像”。
Yu Hua recovers and leaves the hospital, but no one at home welcomes him back - his wife was infected while caring for him and was being treated in hospital; she confines herself to the "little black room" where she lies, reading books and musical instruments left by her father, regretting that she never told him, "You are my idol."
不过，因病毒而支离破碎的生活，正在伤痛中缓慢而坚定地重建。
But life shattered by the virus is slowly but surely being rebuilt in pain.
痊愈者们，有的下定决心重拾梦想，有的期待隔离期满、重返医疗前线。
Some of the healers are determined to reclaim their dreams, while others look forward to the end of isolation and the return to the medical front.
▲弓露的病历本和出院后服用的药物，后面是弓露父亲留下的古筝。
Toxoplasma history books and discharged from the hospital after the medication, the bow Lu father left behind the Guzheng.
受访者供图━━━━━出院后 我开始整理父亲的遗物讲述者：弓露女 38岁 新冠肺炎临床诊断患者我回来后把自己关进了“小黑屋”——家里有一个房间空着，我就住在这个房间里，所有吃喝都是妈妈管，她放在门口，我自己去拿。
2007-9-24 16: 48 I Began to Tidy Father's Legacy Narrator: A Clinical Diagnostic of Toxoplasma gonorrhoeae 38-year-old New Crown Pneumonia. I returned and shut myself up in a "little black room" where my room was empty.
吃饭的碗筷，她会戴手套去拿。
Chopsticks for eating. She will wear gloves to get them.
家里经常消毒，拖地，用酒精擦一擦。
Disinfect your home regularly, mop the floor, and wipe it with alcohol.
住院之前，我一个人在房间里呆了四天，后来因为症状加重，才去医院住院治疗。
I stayed alone in the room for four days before being hospitalized, and then went to hospital because my symptoms had worsened.
说实话，回来还是不适应，住院18天，有点长，回来感觉把家里人惊动了，啥事也不能干，小孩也不能管、饭也不能做，都是妈妈照顾，她今年快七十岁了。
To tell the truth, back or not, 18 days in hospital, a bit long, back to the family feel alarmed, nothing can do, children can not control, meals can not do, are mother care, she is nearly 70 years old.
我住院的时候，他们心里挂念，但是生活不用管。
When I was in the hospital, they were worried, but life was out of the question.
我不太习惯别人照顾我，比较喜欢去分担，喜欢大家一起去做。
I am not used to others take care of me, prefer to share, like to do together.
我住的“小黑屋”是爸妈的主卧，打算把爸爸留下的东西整理一下。
I live in the "small black room" is my parents' master bedroom, intends to put his father left things tidy.
爸爸工作了三四十年，在一家工厂里当小领导，是老一辈的实干家。
Dad worked for thirty or forty years, working as a small leader in a factory and a doer for the older generation.
我们家的事都是爸爸说了算，他的地位是第一位的，一言九鼎。
Dad's the one in charge of everything in our family. His position is number one.
不清楚爸爸是怎么感染的。
I don't know how dad got it.
他有支气管炎，一月十几日开始感冒、咳嗽，我叮嘱他去医院看病。
He has bronchitis, January 10 began to catch a cold, cough, I advised him to go to the hospital.
当时武汉市知道“新冠”的人很少，也没有防范意识，就当感冒治。
At that time Wuhan city knew "new crown" few people, also did not have the precaution consciousness, treats when the cold.
20日前后，他去武汉第四医院打了三天针，病情没有好转。
Around 20 days ago, he went to Wuhan Fourth Hospital for three days, the condition did not improve.
22日，我带他去同济医院发热门诊，才知道了新冠肺炎，看到医生护士都穿得很严实，第一次意识到这个病可能很严重。
22, I took him to Tongji Hospital fever clinic, only to learn about the new crown pneumonia, see doctors and nurses are dressed very tightly, the first time realize that the disease may be very serious.
当时看病的基本都是老人，只要发烧，都往医院跑，我们晚上十点多排队，排到快12点，当时也不知道核酸检测，带的是三四年前拍过的片子，医生看了眼判断结果比较好，开了一针。
At that time, the doctors are basically old people, as long as the fever, we ran to the hospital, we line up at 10 pm, until nearly 12 o'clock, at that time did not know nucleic acid testing, took three or four years ago, the doctor looked at the results better, gave a shot.
他当时胸闷气短、呼吸不畅，已经比较难过了，但没地方躺，只能坐在板凳上，找护士要了一个氧气瓶，一边吸氧一边打，一直到凌晨5点多，给他买了早饭，让他勉强吃了一点，但不愿意再排队就医了，说要回家睡觉，我们想着打了针应该会缓解，就回去了。
But there was no room to lie on the bench. He asked the nurse for an oxygen bottle, and while he sucked in oxygen until more than 5 a.m., he got breakfast and was forced to eat. But he did not want to wait in line to go to bed.
就这么休息了半天，晚上听他发出不舒服的声音，问他好点没有，说没有。
After a long rest, he listened to his uncomfortable voice in the evening and asked him if he was better and if he didn't.
我爸爸很好强，有多难受不会描述，只说胸闷，但当时话已经说不太清楚了，觉得不对劲，赶紧带他去医院。
My father is very strong, how sad can not describe, only said chest tightness, but then the words have not been clear, feel strange, take him to the hospital.
那天是1月23日，武汉封城了，在路上拦出租车，基本不停，最后遇上一个善良的司机，把我们拉去了汉阳医院。
It was January 23, Wuhan closed the city, in the road to stop the taxi, basically non-stop, finally met a kind driver, we were dragged to the Hanyang Hospital.
一边抢救，我老公一边联系住院床位，但没有等到，大年初一的凌晨，爸爸去世了，前后不超过5天。
While rescuing, my husband while contacting the hospital bed, but did not wait until the early morning of New Year's Day, father died, before and after five days.
到我呼吸不畅的时候，武汉宣传“新冠”的力度已经比较大了。
By the time I breathe less, Wuhan propaganda "new crown" of the strength has been relatively large.
我不知道自己是什么时候出现肺部感染的，可能是照顾爸爸距离太近，也可能是带他去医院时交叉感染。
I don't know when I had a lung infection, either because I was too close to my dad or because I took him to the hospital with a cross-infection.
拍了CT，双肺都有磨玻璃影，然后就开始住院。
Take a CT, both lungs have grinded glass shadow, then began to be hospitalized.
得了这个病，感觉鼻子不够用，呼吸困难，下不了床，一下床就不停咳嗽、感觉一口气要过去了，就连正常的生理需求也很难完成。
With this disease, the nose is not enough, breathing difficulties, can not get out of bed, one go on coughing, feel a breath to pass, even normal physiological needs are difficult to complete.
我买了板凳、尿盆，前一个星期，都是穿着纸尿裤、坐在板凳上排出来，然后扔在垃圾桶，让保洁阿姨处理。
I bought a bench, a urinal and, the week before, sat down on a bench in diapers and dumped them in the trash can for Aunt Procter to deal with.
经历变故之后，我的求生欲很强，觉得自己的责任还没有开始承担，还有好多事情要做，我跟自己说，不能倒，要坚强，不能下床的时候，就尽量不取氧气，努力、努力地呼吸。
After the accident, I have a strong desire for survival, I feel my responsibility has not begun to take on, there are still a lot of things to do, I told myself, can not fail, to be strong, can not get out of bed, try not to oxygen, hard, hard breathing.
到后面，能正常上厕所了、不会咳得喘不来气了，就知道自己慢慢变好了。
In the back, can go to the toilet normally, won't coughing to be unable to gasp, knew oneself slowly changed to be good.
“小黑屋”里有很多爸爸的书、乐器、资料，看了都是泪。
"Small black room" has a lot of papa's books, musical instruments, materials, read are tears.
但，其实也没关系，看到这些，也是一种念想，有时候会想如果怎样该多好。
But, in fact, it doesn't matter, see these, is also a kind of thinking, sometimes think if how much better.
有好多话，是想对我爸说、但说不出来的。
There are a lot of things I want to say to my dad, but I can't tell.
他是严父，对我管教很严，我和他的关系，以前并不是特别亲近。
He was a strict father, strict with me, and my relationship with him had not been particularly intimate before.
我是一个有点自卑的人，工作很拼命，那么努力，都是想让他认可我，我没有他想象得那么差。
I am a bit self-abased person, work very hard, so hard, all want him to accept me, I am not as bad as he imagined.
成家之后，我开始理解他，关系就好了一些。
After starting a family, I began to understand him and get on better.
但时间太短了，到现在也才七八年。
But the time is too short. It is only seven or eight years now.
他一直是我心中的偶像，这句话，我没有机会跟他说，也不好意思说。
He has always been my idol, this sentence, I did not have the opportunity to speak to him, also embarrassed to say.
我从小不是一个幸运的人，买彩票也不会中奖，能这么快住上院、好起来，我觉得是爸爸给我的幸运。
I was not a lucky person when I was a child. I won't win the lottery. I think my father gave me the good fortune to live in the Upper House so soon.
可能冥冥之中，他告诉我要长大了，要变成一根柱子，把这个家撑起来。
Maybe somehow, he told me to grow up and become a pillar to prop up the family.
现在最想做的事情，是把自己的家庭料理好，让它恢复正轨。
The most important thing to do now is to take care of your family and get it back on track.
爸爸走了，这个家有点破碎，每个人心里都有一份悲伤，但是不能宣泄，宣泄了就会拉低抵抗力、病毒就会乘虚而入，所以我们咬着牙齿，要好好活着。
Dad is gone, the family is a bit broken, everyone has a sad heart, but can not vent, vent will pull down resistance, the virus will enter, so we bite teeth, to live well.
等隔离期结束，等武汉解封、疫情过去，我要承担自己的责任，好好照顾家人，把这个家像捏面粉一样捏起来。
When the quarantine period is over, and Wuhan is over, I will assume my responsibility to take good care of my family and knead the house like flour.
▲2004年，余华第一次穿上护士服。
In 2004, Yu Hua wore a nurse's uniform for the first time.
受访者供图━━━━━隔离期满 我会重返一线讲述者：余华女 38岁 新冠肺炎确诊患者我回到家的那天，家里人特别开心，做了很多好吃的。
2007-9-24 16: 48 When I got home, my family was very happy. They made a lot of delicious food.
女儿很久没看到我，想让我抱，但我不能抱她，告诉她妈妈还要隔离14天，她很伤心，回到自己房间里哭。
My daughter had not seen me for a long time and wanted me to hold her, but I could not hold her and told her that her mother needed to be kept in isolation for 14 days.
家里房子不大，没法做到单间隔离，只能都戴口罩、勤洗手，吃饭的时候分着吃，有的在阳台、有的在客厅、有的在房间。
The house is not big enough to be isolated. All they have to do is wear masks, wash their hands frequently and share food with them, some on the balcony, some in the living room and some in the room.
戴口罩太憋，女儿不愿意戴，这是我唯一担心的事。
Wearing masks is too much and my daughter is reluctant to wear them. That's the only thing I'm worried about.
这几天武汉天气变化快，下了两天雪，回暖的天又降温了。
The weather in Wuhan has changed rapidly these days. It snowed for two days, and the warm days have cooled down again.
我有点咳嗽，其他都还好。
I have a cough. Everything else is OK.
确诊阳性之前，我一直不相信自己会感染上“新冠”。
I didn't believe I would get a new crown until I found out I was positive.
我是一名ICU的护士，在我们病区，有很多心脏术后的患者，咳嗽、发热比较常见，谁也不会往这上面想。
I am an ICU nurse, in our area, there are a lot of heart surgery patients, cough, fever is more common, no one would like to this.
气管插管、吸痰是常规操作，我们一直戴着口罩，一开始是外科口罩、后来升级成N95、防护服。
Trachea intubation, sputum suction is a routine operation, we have been wearing masks, first surgical mask, later upgraded to N95, protective clothing.
但我看护的那位患者，当时没有确诊，我不能下定论是在医院感染的，到今天，我也无法确定被感染的原因。
But the patient I was looking after, who wasn't diagnosed at the time, I can't say conclusively that the infection was in the hospital, and to this day, I'm not sure why.
确诊之后，我是恐惧的。
After the diagnosis, I was scared.
最初的症状和感冒差不多，不严重，也没有呼吸困难。
The initial symptoms were similar to those of a cold, not serious, and without breathing difficulties.
后来病情加重，咳嗽频繁、肌肉酸痛，在床上躺着，翻身都困难。
Later, the disease aggravated, cough frequently, muscle pain, lying in bed, turn all difficult.
最难受的是药物反应，吃了柯立芝和莫西沙星，症状缓解了，但晕眩、恶心，上午吃了药，中午连饭都吃不下。
The worst of all was the drug reaction, with Coolidge and moxifloxacin, which relieved his symptoms but made him dizzy and nauseous. He took medicine in the morning and could not even eat lunch.
我的身体素质一向不错，从来没有这么难受过，又担心病情会进一步发展，看到一些死亡病例，心中害怕，会偷偷地哭。
I have always been in good health, I have never suffered so much, and I am afraid that my illness will develop further, that I will see some deaths, that I shall cry secretly.
我一开始住在重症病房，对床有一个病友情况严重、高热不断，安慰我，说我精神挺好、看起来不错，让我恢复了一些信心。
I started out in the intensive care unit with a sick friend who was in a serious, feverish condition and comforted me by telling me that I was in good spirits, looking good and giving me some confidence.
想想家里的老人和孩子，跟自己说必须活着，就当是一次感冒，该怎么治就怎么治。
Think of the old people and children at home, and tell themselves to live, as if it is a cold, how to treat.
后来症状减轻了，情绪慢慢调整过来。
Then the symptoms eased and the mood slowly adjusted.
之后换了病房，有一个病友年龄大、症状比较重，我也去宽慰她，让她好好吸氧、不要焦虑，告诉她自己也经历了加重和转轻的过程，后来她知道我是护士，比较听得进去，病情也好转了。
Then I changed the ward and one of my sick friends was older and more symptomatic. I went to comfort her, let her take some oxygen and not worry, and told her that I had gone through a process of aggravation and lightening.
知道我出院后，有同事来加我微信。
When I got out of the hospital, someone from work came to talk to me.
其中一位是医院的护工，感染之后呼吸困难、咳嗽，住在方舱医院接受治疗，询问我病情发展情况、怎么治疗、药物反应、后续检查等。
One of them, a hospital attendant, had difficulty breathing and coughing after the infection and was treated at the cabin hospital. He asked me how my condition was developing, how to treat it, how to respond to it, follow-up examinations, etc.
其实大家都是医务人员，关于新冠和治疗的信息，网上一搜都有，来找我可能并不是出于获取信息，而是因为害怕。
In fact, we are all medical personnel, new crowns and treatment information, a search on the Internet, I may not come to me out of information, but out of fear.
和我聊一聊，他们心里就踏实了，确信这个病是可以治好的，那就很好。
When they talk to me, they are reassured that the disease can be cured, and that's fine.
当了一次患者，我对护士和患者都加深了理解。
When I was a patient, I learned a lot about nurses and patients.
以前工作时，遇到来自病人的不理解，自己会有些不平，有时要抱怨几句。
In the past work, encountered from the patient's understanding, I will be a bit uneven, sometimes have to complain a few words.
得病之后发现，身体难受，心里也会不舒服，需要一个发泄的渠道，以后再遇到激动的患者，我就更能理解他们了。
After the illness found, physical discomfort, the heart will not be comfortable, the need for an outlet, and later encountered excited patients, I can understand them more.
这次经历，也让我看到了护士这个职业的神圣性，他们真的很伟大。
This experience, but also let me see that the profession of nurses is sacred, they are really great.
在隔离病房里穿着厚厚的防护服，光走路都挺累的，一个病区那么多病人，呼叫铃一响，不管大事小事，他们都要跑过来；护目镜上全是水汽，看东西都很难，还要做各种操作。
In the isolation ward, wearing thick protective clothing, walking is quite tired, a sick area of so many patients, call the bell, regardless of small things, they have to run over; the goggles are full of steam, things are difficult to see, there are a variety of operations.
我能做的只有尽量配合他们，尽量不找他们。
All I can do is try to cooperate with them and try not to find them.
SARS期间，电视中冲在一线的医务人员触动了我，那一年，我选择上了护校。
During SARS, I was touched by front-line medical staff on TV, and that year I chose to attend a nursing school.
疫情来袭，医护人员的确会面临防护的风险，毕竟，这就是一场战争。
When the epidemic strikes, health care workers do face protection risks. After all, it is a war.
但我相信，守护病人是医护人员的职责所在，哪怕我们只是站出来，都能给病人信心。
But I believe that it is the duty of health care workers to guard patients, even if we just stand up, can give patients confidence.
我工作的单位也是一家定点医院，还有很多病人需要我，等隔离期满，我会重返一线，不给自己留下遗憾。
I work in a designated hospital, there are still a lot of patients need me, when the isolation period, I will return to the line, do not leave regret.
▲2月19日，武汉协和医院西院区31名新冠肺炎重症患者治愈出院。
Feb. 19, Wuhan Hsiehe Hospital West courtyard district 31 patients with severe pneumonia treated and discharged.
摄影/新京报记者 陶冉━━━━━邻床三个病友去世 但我不怕死亡讲述者：郁华男 75岁 新冠肺炎确诊患者我是年前外出买菜时被感染的。
2007-9-25 09: 48 Three sick people have died but I am not afraid of death Narrator: Yuhua male 75-year-old newly diagnosed with pneumonia I got the infection when I was out shopping years ago.
要过年了，我去菜市场买些食材，准备年夜饭。
It is Spring Festival, I go to the vegetable market to buy some food, prepare New Year's Eve dinner.
感染后潜伏了四天，有了症状，上呼吸道感染、拉肚子、脑袋疼得厉害。
Hidden after the infection for four days, have symptoms, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, head pain is severe.
大年三十那天就很疲劳，过个年，连春晚都没有看成。
New Year's Day is very tired, even the Spring Festival Gala did not see.
1月25日开始发烧，一直烧到2月1日。
Fever began on 25 January and lasted until 1 February.
当时武汉的医疗资源非常紧张，医院人满为患，很难挂上号，老伴是退休医生，我们就自己在家治疗。
Wuhan at the time of very tight medical resources, hospital overcrowding, it is difficult to hang up, my wife is a retired doctor, we treat ourselves at home.
我在家里用了头孢、抗生素、抗病毒的药，也吃了去火的中药，这个病没有特效药，就对症处理。
I used cephalosporin, antibiotics, antiviral drugs at home, but also took Chinese medicine to remove fire, this disease has no specific medicine, symptomatic treatment.
知道这个病后，我和老伴也进行了隔离，平时也就送饭送水。
After knowing this illness, my wife and I also carried out isolation, usually to send food and water.
我1月28日做了核酸检测，结果阳性。
I had a nucleic acid test on January 28th, and the results were positive.
到了2月5日，被通知可以进医院了，开始住院治疗。
On 5 February, he was informed that he would be admitted to the hospital and that hospitalization would begin.
我会关注医生给我开药的情况，如果增加了，就说明严重了，我的病情一直比较平稳。
I will pay attention to the doctor to give me medicine, if the increase, it means serious, my condition has been relatively stable.
我住42床，41床的病友走了一位，43床走了两位，我在中间，但我不怎么害怕，连医生都觉得奇怪，夸我心态好，问我是做什么职业的。
I had 42 beds, a 41-bed patient had gone, 43 beds had gone, I was in the middle, but I wasn't so scared that even the doctor was surprised, boasted me of my good nature, and asked me what my occupation was.
其实我想得很开，我老了，到了这把年纪，走了，也不过是人类自然的新陈代谢。
In fact, I think very open, I am old, at this age, left, but also natural human metabolism.
唯一的担忧是传染给别人。
The only concern is to infect others.
出院的前几天，老伴确诊阳性住院了。
A few days before he was discharged from the hospital, his wife confirmed positive.
她胸闷、气喘，但没有发烧，症状比较轻，大概是和我密切接触感染的。
Her chest is stuffy, breathless, but does not have a fever, symptom is lighter, probably close contact with me infect.
我们前后脚住院。
We were hospitalized.
期间我们保持联系，互相安慰，互相鼓励。
We kept in touch, comforted and encouraged each other.
我先进去，知道医院的环境，老伴个性好强、性子急，嘱咐她心气平和，尤其是封闭的环境下，和病友好好相处，不要着急、不要任性。
I go in first, I know the hospital environment, my wife strong personality, quick temper, told her to calm down, especially in a closed environment, and the patient get along well, do not worry, do not wayward.
在医院要遵医嘱，听人安排，好好吸氧，不要自己擅自吃药。
In the hospital to follow the doctor's advice, listen to the arrangement, good oxygen, do not take their own medicine.
我们都七十多岁了，是同学，已经算白头偕老了，平时偶尔会吵闹，但感情是不错的。
We are all more than 70 years old, is a classmate, has been calculated to grow old, peacetime occasionally noisy, but the feelings are good.
出院回家，自己隔离半个月，也没有什么不方便。
I was discharged from the hospital and went home in isolation for half a month.
以前在家，老伴负责搞卫生，我负责买菜做饭，很习惯做家务，只要不倒下，自己安排自己的生活，没有问题。
In the past, my wife was responsible for hygiene, I was responsible for food and cooking, very used to do housework, as long as you do not fall, their own arrangements for life, no problem.
这期间，打算把卫生搞一下，衣服都消毒，洗了一半，还剩一半，慢慢来；本来想记录一下非常时期的心得体会，但是人老了，眼睛不太好，有时候和朋友同学通电话，聊一聊；累了，就躺一会儿，就是这样的安排。
In the meantime, the intention was to have the sanitation done, the clothes disinfected, half washed, and half unwashed, and to take your time; but the man was old, and his eyes were not so good, and sometimes he talked on the telephone with his friends and classmates, and when he was tired, lay down for a while.
━━━━━人这一辈子说不清 生死就在一瞬间讲述者：吴三石男 51岁 新冠肺炎确诊患者五六岁的时候，我在长江边玩耍，不小心掉进江里，如果没有邻居出手相救，可能就淹死了。
2007-9-24 16: 48 When I was five or six years old, I was playing along the Yangtze River and fell into the river. If no neighbor had offered to rescue me, I might have drowned.
51岁感染“新冠”，是我人生中第二次经历生死。
The 51-year-old's new crown is the second time in my life that I have experienced life and death.
一月下旬开始知道有这么个病，朋友圈里时不时流传一些新闻，但当时没确定人传人，不太重视，戴了口罩，但不太习惯，有时候说话不方便，就摘了。
In late January I began to realize that there was such a thing as a disease. Now and then there was some news circulating in the circle of friends.
1月21日，亲朋好友十多人一起吃了年夜饭，第二天开始有些头疼，测体温发现发烧，第二天去门诊做CT，怀疑新冠，2月3日确诊阳性。
On January 21, more than a dozen friends and relatives had dinner together. The next day they had a headache. Their temperature was detected with fever.
我到现在不清楚自己怎么感染的，因为同桌的亲友并没有发病。
I still don't know how I got the infection, because friends and relatives at the table didn't get sick.
一开始的症状不太严重，只是头疼。
At first the symptoms were not serious, just headaches.
后来开始发烧，持续了12天。
He developed a fever which lasted 12 days.
住院之后，病情逐渐加重，有三四天，完全吃不下东西。
After hospitalization, the condition gradually increased, for three or four days, completely unable to eat.
我平时食欲还可以，不挑食，但当时胃肠反应厉害，又饿、又恶心，盒饭吃一口就扔了。
I usually appetite is OK, not picky food, but at that time gastrointestinal reaction is fierce, hungry, and nausea, boxed rice on a bite to throw away.
我不知道自己会不会好。
I don't know if I'll ever get better.
体温降不下来、东西吃不进去，就觉得病情严重，开始害怕。
The body temperature cannot come down, the thing cannot eat go in, feel ill condition serious, begin to be afraid.
那段时间，每天恍恍惚惚，脑袋里不太清醒，分不清真实和梦境的区别。
At that time, every day drifted off, the brain is not too clear, the difference between the real and the dream.
住院期间，家人给我打电话，我不想接；发来微信，但指甲已经长得很长，差不多一厘米左右了，触屏写字不方便，也不太想回。
During my stay in the hospital, my family called me and I didn't want to pick up the letter, but the fingernails were already very long, about a centimeter long, and the touch screen wasn't very convenient and I didn't want to go back.
在感染之前，我已经有三十多年没进过医院了，刚开始并不觉得严重。
I hadn't been in hospital for more than 30 years before the infection, and it didn't seem serious at first.
到了这个年龄，身体逐渐变差，慢慢怕死了。
At this age, the body gradually becomes worse, slowly afraid of death.
我住的病房是双人间，我们都拉着帘子，隔壁病友病情严重一点，我们不太交流，这个病是飞沫传播，我怕再被传染。
I live in a double room, we all pull the curtain, next door patient is a little more serious, we do not communicate much, this disease is droplets spread, I am afraid of re-infection.
住院初期，每天刷新闻，有时看到死亡案例，心咯噔一下；慢慢好了，就看电视剧，美剧、韩剧，把原来没看完的补上。
At the beginning of the hospital, every day brush the news, sometimes see the death cases, heart clatter; slowly good, watching TV series, American Opera, Korean drama, the original did not finish to fill up.
其实也看不进去，但还是要打发时间。
In fact can not see, but still want to pass the time.
不敢看疫情相关的影片，心里害怕。
Do not dare to watch the epidemic-related film, heart fear.
回了家，分成两个区域，继续隔离。
Back home, divided into two areas, continue to isolate.
吃饭的时候，老婆给递过来，当面很少交流，偶尔微信上说两句。
Dinner time, his wife to pass over, very little face-to-face communication, occasionally micro-letter to say a few words.
人这一辈子说不清楚。
One cannot tell for a lifetime.
觉得自己的身体可以活到八九十岁，但意外不知什么时候就来，想做什么就去做。
I feel like I can live to be eighty-nine, but I don't know when I'll come and do what I want.
小孩念大学时不爱上课，喜欢音乐，自己写歌，当时我批评他，让他以学业为主，他说等以后工作、结婚、生子，就不再有时间，只有现在才有机会。
When I criticized him and made him concentrate on his studies, he said he would have no more time to work, marry, have children, and have a chance only now.
他倒是说对了，想做的赶紧去做，拖拖拉拉的，可能就做不了了。
He is right to do what he wants to do quickly and dragging his feet may not be able to do it.
我也有没有完成的事。
I don't have any work to do.
小时候喜欢读书，古典诗词的意境很美，工作忙了就放下了。
When I was a child, I loved reading. The artistic conception of classical poetry was beautiful.
这次好了，打算继续加强这方面的学习，定一个明确的计划，坚持下来。
This time, I plan to continue to strengthen my study in this field, make a clear plan and stick to it.
以后要更注意身体，加强锻炼，多和家人联系，保持家庭和睦。
In the future, we should pay more attention to the body, strengthen exercise, more contact with family, maintain family harmony.
生活中有一些小矛盾、利益纠葛，对于后半段的人生，都算不了什么。
There are some minor contradictions and conflicts of interest in life, for the second half of life, is nothing.
不要为了一些蝇头小利跟人家去争，家庭和工作，都要和谐一点。
Don't argue with others for some minuscule profits, family and work, be in harmony.
