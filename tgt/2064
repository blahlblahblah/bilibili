随着初春季节的到来，流行性感冒也进入了高发期。
With the arrival of the early spring season, influenza has also entered the high season.
而在新冠病毒肺炎疫情的影响下，钟南山院士日前公开呼吁：把流感和新冠肺炎两类病人区分开来是当务之急。
Under the influence of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, academician Zhong Nan Shan has made a public appeal: it is imperative to distinguish between influenza and pneumonia.
为何将流感和新冠肺炎区分开来如此重要？钟南山：区分流感与新冠肺炎是当务之急23日，钟南山院士在广州跟驰援荆州的广东医疗队远程会诊时，特别强调了将流感和新冠肺炎两类疾病区分开来的重要性。
CHUNG Nan Shan: Distinguishing Influenza from Newly Coronary Pneumonia is a top priority. Academician Zhong Nan-shan stressed the importance of distinguishing between influenza and pneumonia in a tele-consultation with the Guangdong Medical Team in Jingzhou, Guangdong Province.
钟南山表示，当前防控关键是将两种疾病患者分开：“现在美国的流感大流行，而且病例远远高过新冠肺炎病例。
The key to prevention and control now is to separate the two groups of patients: "There is an influenza pandemic in the US, and the number of cases is far higher than the number of new cases," says Mr Zhong.
中国也有这个（流感）情况，把两者鉴别开来是当务之急。
China also has this situation and it is imperative to distinguish between the two.
”同时，钟南山透露，中国国家药品监督管理局现已经批了几种药品，其中一个就是关于如何鉴别流感、新冠肺炎和副流感的试剂。
Meanwhile, Zhong Nan-shan said the State Administration of Pharmacy had approved several drugs, including one on how to identify reagents for influenza, new crown pneumonia and parainfluenza.
钟南山直言：“这是很关键的工作”。
Zhong Nan Shan said bluntly: "This is very crucial work."
区分流感和新冠病毒肺炎何以成为眼下防控工作的当务之急？一位不愿透露姓名的免疫学专家向中新网解释：新冠病毒肺炎是新发传染病，是按甲类传染病来管理的疾病；而流感则属于丙类传染病，两者规定的管理地位有所不同。
A team of unnamed immunologists explained to Sinochem that pneumonia is a new infectious disease, managed as a Class A infectious disease, and influenza is a C-type infectious disease with a different regulatory status.
随着当下流感高峰期的到来，上述专家明确指出：“如不将两者区分开来，尤其是将二者都视为新冠病毒肺炎进行集中收治，就会大大增加交叉感染的几率。
With the onset of the current influenza pandemic, the experts clearly point out that "failure to distinguish between the two, and especially to treat both as concentrated cases of Newcastle disease pneumonia, significantly increases the risk of cross-infection."
”而从目前的研究进展来看，区分两类疾病的困难仍停留在检测确诊环节。
However, in the light of current research progress, the difficulty of distinguishing between the two types of diseases remains in the detection of diagnosis.
他解释称：“就目前来看，区分两种疾病最好的标准，仍是进行病原学检测或免疫学检测，也即通常说的核酸检测。
"For the time being, the best way to distinguish between the two diseases is still to have an etiology test or an immunological test, commonly known as nucleic acid testing," he explained.
但二者检测的序列有所不同，新冠肺炎主要进行新冠病毒的序列检测；流感则是通过检测流感病毒序列完成。
But the sequence of detection is different, the new crown pneumonia mainly carries on the new crown virus sequence detection; the flu is through the detection influenza virus sequence.
然而，由于新冠肺炎属新发传染病，因此在确诊上仍存在漏洞。
However, there is still a gap in diagnosis due to the newly emerging infectious disease of Newly Coronary Pneumonia.
专家分析认为：“新冠肺炎核酸检测阳性率比较低、临床症状又比较多样，所以鉴别起来还需要积累经验。
Experts believe: "New crown pneumonia nucleic acid positive rate is relatively low, clinical symptoms are more diverse, so it is necessary to accumulate experience.
”流感与新冠肺炎区别有哪些？每年冬季与初春季节是流感暴发的高峰期。
What is the difference between influenza and new crown pneumonia? Winter and early spring are the peak seasons of an influenza outbreak.
在新冠肺炎疫情的影响下，我们又该如何将流感和新冠肺炎区分开来呢？就此问题，首都医科大学附属北京儿童医院急诊科主任王荃在2月1日国家卫生健康委召开的新闻发布会上，就从上述疾病的致病源、发病时间、症状和易感人群四个角度进行了比对。
In response to the outbreak of pneumonia, how can we distinguish between influenza and pneumonia? Wang Tsuen, director of the emergency department of Beijing Children's Hospital attached to the Capital Medical University, compared the causes, timing, symptoms and susceptibility of these diseases at a press conference on February 1.
首先，从致病源来看，王荃明确，流感是一种呼吸道传染病，由流感病毒导致。
First of all, from the point of view of the pathogen, wang Tsuen clear, influenza is a respiratory infectious disease, caused by influenza viruses.
新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎也是一种传染病，且有明确的流行病学史，系感染新冠病毒所致。
Pneumonia, a new coronavirus infection, is also an infectious disease with a clear epidemiological history, resulting from infection with the new coronavirus.
其次，两种疾病的发病时间也不一致。
Second, the onset of the two diseases is inconsistent.
王荃解释称，流感全年都可能发病，但高发季节主要是冬春季。
Wang explained that influenza can happen all year round, but the high season is mainly winter and spring.
新冠肺炎从目前来看，则是2019年底冬季新近发病的疾病。
New Crown Pneumonia from the point of view of the end of 2019 winter is a new disease.
此外，上述专家补充，两种疾病的潜伏期也略有不同：“新冠肺炎患者的潜伏期基本在14天，少数会更长；但流感潜伏期一般在一周之内，超过10天的潜伏期较为罕见。
In addition, the incubation period for the two diseases is slightly different: "The incubation period for new crown pneumonia patients is about 14 days, and a few more; but the incubation period for influenza is usually within a week, with incubation periods greater than 10 days being rare.
”从临床症状来看，两种疾病均伴有发热的现象。
In terms of clinical symptoms, both conditions are associated with fever.
“流感有非常明显的发烧，且常常是高热，一般持续3-5天；新冠肺炎的主要症状则包括发热、咳嗽、乏力，甚至出现呕吐、腹痛、腹泻等症状。
"Influenza has a very pronounced fever and is often high, usually lasting 3-5 days. The main symptoms of pneumonia include fever, cough, fatigue, and even vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
”王荃说。
'said Wang Tsuen.
上述免疫专家则表示，虽然两者均属呼吸道疾病，但流感属于上呼吸道感染，患者往往会有流鼻涕、支气管受刺激产生分泌物等症状；而新冠肺炎则属于下呼吸道感染，表现在肺部出现炎症，患者往往以干咳为主，且有呼吸困难的情况。
Although both are respiratory diseases, the flu is an upper respiratory infection, with symptoms such as runny nose and bronchial irritation producing secretions. Coronary pneumonia is a lower respiratory infection and manifests itself in inflammation of the lungs, often with dry cough and dyspnea.
最后，从易感人群的方面来看，王荃指出，流感和新冠肺炎均属于人群普遍易感，尤其是小于2岁的儿童，超过65岁的老年人，肥胖的人，孕妇，有免疫抑制的病人，都是流感高危人群。
Finally, from the point of view of the susceptible population, Wang Tsuen points out that influenza and pneumonia are common among the population, especially children younger than 2 years of age, older people over 65, obese people, pregnant women and immunosuppressive patients, who are at high risk of influenza.
另从目前的案例来看，新冠肺炎表现在老年人和有慢性基础病的病人更为严重，甚至可能致死。
In addition, from the current case, the new crown pneumonia in the elderly and patients with chronic basic diseases more serious, and may even die.
流感VS新冠肺炎哪个更可怕？作为一种新发传染病，新冠肺炎疫情来势汹汹。
Flu VS new crown pneumonia which is more terrible? As a new infectious disease, the outbreak of new crown pneumonia.
截至2月23日24时，31省和新疆生产建设兵团报告，现有确诊病例49824例，其中重症病例9915例，累计治愈出院病例24734例，累计死亡病例2592例，累计报告确诊病例77150例。
As at 2400 hours on 23 February, 31 provinces and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps had reported 49,824 confirmed cases, including 9,915 serious cases, 24,734 cumulative cases of discharge, 2,592 cumulative cases of death and a cumulative total of 77150 confirmed cases.
相比之下，流感的危害同样不可小觑。
The dangers of flu, by contrast, are no less significant.
据世界卫生组织2019年透露，流感每年估计导致全球10亿病例，其中包括300万至500万重症病例，与流感相关的呼吸道疾病死亡人数达29万至65万。
According to the World Health Organization in 2019, influenza causes an estimated 1 billion cases worldwide each year, including 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases.
那么，流感会比新冠肺炎还可怕?“从传染性和致死率来说，目前还很难判断两种疾病谁更严重。
So the flu could be worse than pneumonia? "In terms of infectivity and mortality, it's hard to tell who's more serious."
”专家表示，因新冠肺炎疫情尚未结束，评价其严重程度为时尚早。
Experts said it was too early to assess the severity of the outbreak as it was not over.
而之所以直接将其定义为乙类传染病并按甲类传染病管理，是因其为一种新发传染病，尚对其发病路径不明晰，所以管控措施高于流感。
The reason why it is defined as B infectious diseases and managed according to A infectious diseases is that it is a new infectious disease, but its pathogenesis is not clear, so the control measures are higher than influenza.
但在专家看来，群众大可不必对流感恐慌。
But experts say the public need not panic about the flu.
“相比于新冠肺炎，我们和流感打交道时间很长，非常了解流感的疾病特点，对该疾病患者的基础免疫能力也基本能做到心中有数。
"We have a much longer history of dealing with influenza than we do with Newcastle Pneumonia. We know very well the characteristics of the disease and the basic immunity of people with the disease.
”专家表明，流感对大多数人来说可治愈，如针对甲流的奥司他韦药，只要对症下药，都无需住院治疗。
Experts say the flu is curable for most people, such as oseltamivir for swine flu, which requires no hospitalization if the drug is the right medicine.
“况且，目前中国已有治疗流感的成熟技术，能根据流感病毒株来对疫苗生产线进行改造，生产出适合不同季节的流感疫苗。
"Moreover, there is now a mature technology for treating influenza in China that can be adapted to influenza strains to produce flu vaccines for different seasons.
同时也有治疗流感的特效药，所以无需对流感恐慌。
There are also specific medicines to treat flu, so there is no need to panic about flu.
”相较之下，由于缺乏特效药和疫苗，新冠肺炎则尚需接受住院治疗。
Coronary pneumonia, by contrast, has yet to be hospitalized because of a lack of specific drugs and vaccines.
同时，专家也提醒，无论是流感还是新冠肺炎，患者不必紧张但也不可掉以轻心：“尤其是在感冒药管控的情况下，如有症状还需到医院就医，且做好相应防护措施。
And experts caution that patients should not be nervous about flu or pneumonia, but be careful: "Especially with cold medications, if you have symptoms, go to a hospital and take appropriate precautions.
