澎湃新闻记者 邓雅菲 实习生 陈紫嘉32岁的陈凤是湖北省孝感市中心医院儿科的一名护士。
Peng Pai reporter Deng Yafei intern Chen Zijia 32-year-old Chen Feng is Hubei Xiaoyan City Central Hospital paediatric nurses.
2月5日，她与家中1岁的儿子道别，在该院隔离四病区开始了为期14天的“战疫”工作。
On 5 February, she bid farewell to her 1-year-old son and began 14 days of "epidemic" work in the quarantined quarantined area.
“如若是在平时，目前隔离病房的工作根本算不上累，可是当穿上防护服、戴上护目镜和防护口罩后，哪怕是很简单的生命体征的测量都变得困难起来。
"In normal times, the isolation ward is hardly tiring at all, but even simple measurements of vital signs become difficult when wearing protective clothing, goggles and face masks.
由于护目镜起雾打针难，我还遇到了给患者打了好几次针都打不进去的情况。
As the goggles fogging difficult, I also encountered a number of times to the patient can not hit the injection.
”陈凤告诉澎湃新闻，面对这些情况，患者不但没有埋怨，还鼓励她说，“你们技术还是不错的，也挺不容易的。
"Chen Feng told Peng Pai News that in the face of all this, the patient did not complain and encouraged her to say," Your skills are good and not easy.
”陈凤坦言，那一刻她特别感动，“患者没有因为我们一针没有打好就埋怨、否定我们，而是给了我们理解、包容和鼓励，其实我们比谁都更希望能‘一针见血’。
"Chen Feng admitted that she was particularly moved at that moment." The patient did not complain and disapprove of us because we had not had a good shot, but instead gave us understanding, tolerance and encouragement.
”“抗疫期间，融洽的医患关系让我们深感欣慰。
"We had a good doctor-patient relationship during the fight against the disease.
”在陈凤的描述中，医患之间高度协调、互相配合、井然有序。
Chen Feng's description shows a high degree of coordination, coordination and order between doctors and patients.
大敌当前，医患双方携手共进退：医者全力救治，患者全心信任。
Enemy and patient hand in hand advance and retreat: full medical treatment, patient full-hearted trust.
在这个特殊时期，医患之间的尊重与关爱是这场可怕的疫情中令人感到温暖的“闪光点”。
At this particular time, the respect and care between doctors and patients is a warm flash point in this terrible epidemic.
陈凤身穿写着“凤凤最美，加油”字样的防护服。
Chen Feng wore protective clothing with the words "Fengfeng is the most beautiful, refueling."
陈凤的口述超市员工破例为我开门2月4日下午，我正在陪1岁的儿子时，接到医院通知说第二天要到隔离病房工作，我立刻轻手轻脚起床，出门去超市买生活用品。
On the afternoon of February 4, while I was accompanying my one-year-old son, I was told by the hospital that I would work in the isolation ward the next day.
我步行来到离家最近的超市，可是超市却刚关了门，几个工作人员正准备离开，让我明天再来。
I walked to the nearest supermarket, but it had just closed and a few of the staff were preparing to leave and let me come back tomorrow.
“怎么办，我明天就要去隔离病房工作了！”我很着急地对他们说。
"What? I'm going to work in the isolation ward tomorrow!" I told them anxiously.
工作人员得知我要买成人纸尿裤等生活用品，对我说：“那我帮你开门，你进去买吧，不知道东西在什么地方就问我。
When the clerk learned that I was going to buy adult diapers and other things, he said to me: "Then I'll open the door for you.
”当时我特别感动，在还没有进隔离病房前就感受到了大家的支持。
I was particularly moved then and felt the support of all before I was admitted to the isolation ward.
2月5日，我来到孝感市中心医院隔离四病区，护士长给我们讲了工作中的要求及注意事项后，我们就分头工作了。
Feb. 5, I came to Xiaogan City Central Hospital quarantined four disease areas, the head nurse told us the requirements and precautions at work, we split up.
一部分由提前来到病区熟悉工作环境的同事带到病房工作，另一部分负责整理生活区的环境。
Some are brought to work by colleagues who are familiar with the work environment in the area ahead of schedule, while others are responsible for organizing the living area.
我们主要的工作是给患者实施治疗护理，因为没有卫生员，我们还要兼顾病区及生活区的卫生及消毒工作。
Our main job is to provide curative care for the patients, because without a hygienist, we have to take care of the hygiene and disinfection of the sick areas and living quarters.
来隔离病房之前，护士长曾跟我们说，“我们去隔离病房第一天就要有人来上夜班，谁愿意去就和我说。
Before coming to the isolation ward, the head nurse told us, "We are going to the isolation ward on the first day there will be a night shift.
”我便主动报名了，被安排和我科的艾老师一起上夜班。
"I volunteered to sign up and was assigned to work the night shift with Miss Ai of my department.
我们都是第一次来到隔离区，对隔离病房的工作环境一无所知，心中难免有些担忧，但幸好一切工作都比较顺利。
We were all in the quarantine for the first time, not knowing anything about the working conditions in the isolation ward.
衣服口罩湿透，因害怕感染情绪差点崩溃隔离病房的工作如若是在平时，根本算不上累，可是当穿上防护服、戴上护目镜和防护口罩后，哪怕是很简单的生命体征的测量都变得困难起来。
Wearing protective clothing, goggles and face masks, even simple vital signs can be difficult to measure, though the mask is soaking wet and the work in the isolation ward would not be tiring at all in normal times.
2月7日，是我最难受的一天，上午的治疗比较多，工作不到一个小时，我就感觉到呼吸困难，呼吸完全依赖张口去呼吸，护目镜也一片雾水，根本看不清楚，都在凭借经验做事。
Feb. 7, the worst day for me, with more therapy in the morning, less than an hour of work, I feel breathless, I rely entirely on my mouth to breathe, my goggles are foggy, and I do things by experience.
发静脉用药时，我们都是让患者自己看是不是他的床号和姓名来确认，由于看不清楚，我把6床的药拿错了3次，最后6床患者说，“你的眼镜都糊了，我来帮你找药吧。
I took the six-bed medicine three times by mistake. At last the six patients said, Your glasses are all burnt. Let me help you find the medicine
”我这才把药准确的给她挂好。
"So I hung up the medicine for her accurately.
陈凤佩戴的护目镜一片雾水。
The goggles Chen Feng was wearing were foggy.
当天，6个小时的工作举步维艰，工作时间大概过了一半，我感觉头痛、喘息明显，就和高原反应一样，开始烦躁、不舒服。
As the six-hour work day faltered and I was about halfway through the working day, I felt headache, wheezing visibly and, like the plateau reaction, became irritable and uncomfortable.
我尽可能地调整呼吸、保持平静，幸好有同事的协作和患者的理解才顺利完成工作。
I adjusted my breathing and remained calm as much as I could, thanks to the collaboration of my colleagues and the understanding of my patients.
下班脱防护服时，里面的衣服已经湿透了，让我害怕的是，我里层的口罩也湿透了，而湿口罩是没有防护作用的，我带着担忧赶紧去洗澡。
When I took off my protective clothing, the clothes were soaked to the skin. To my horror, my inner mask was soaked, and I had no protection against it.
回到休息室，头痛明显，虽然很饿，但完全没有胃口吃饭，直接就躺上床休息了。
Back in the lounge, headache obvious, although very hungry, but no appetite to eat, just go to bed and rest.
我躺在床上，想到自己里层口罩湿透，想到自己会不会被感染，想到自己的家人，想到可爱的儿子，情绪一下崩溃了，没忍住哭了起来……同事们赶紧来安慰我，鼓励我说，大家的防护措施已经很严格了，不要太担心，一定会战胜疫情的，我的情绪才平静了许多。
As I lay in bed, I thought of my own mask soaking wet, of being infected, of my family, of my lovely son, I broke down and cried... Colleagues came to comfort me and encouraged me to say that our protective measures were very strict, do not worry too much, will overcome the epidemic, my mood was much calmer.
护目镜起雾打针困难，患者仍理解体谅我们我们这一组护理人员大部分是从儿科来的，平日里进行静脉穿刺如果一针没穿刺好，压力会很大。
It's difficult to fog with goggles, and the patient still understands that most of our care workers are pediatricians, and the pressure can be great if a needle is not punctured well.
一些患儿家属心疼患儿，就会用言语给我们更大的压力。
Some of the children's families are distressed children, we will use words to give us more pressure.
可是在这里，这些患者都能体谅我们戴着满是雾水的护目镜难以看清，哪怕是两次、三次没穿刺成功，都不会指责我们，还说，“我血管细，你们眼镜都糊了，是不好打”。
But here, these patients can understand that we wear fog-filled goggles are difficult to see, even two or three times failed to puncture, will not blame us, and said, "I have thin blood vessels, your glasses are burnt, is not easy to hit."
2月7号上午，给37床患者打针，我打了一针没打好，同事打了三针也没打好，明显感觉他有点疼，可是他一声都没有责备我们。
On the morning of February 7, I injected 37 patients, I missed a shot, my colleague did not hit three shots, obviously feeling a little pain, but he did not blame us.
我们自己都不好意思了，说让他休息一下，等会再打。
We were too embarrassed to ask him to take a break and call back later.
等我们把病房所有针都打上了，我再次来到37床，给他打上了针，他对我说：“你们技术还是不错的，也挺不容易的。
When we had all the needles on the ward, I went to bed 37 again and gave him an injection. He said to me, "You are very skilled and not very easy.
”那一刻我特别感动，患者没有因为我们一针没有打好就埋怨我们、否定我们，而是给了我们理解、包容和鼓励，其实我们比谁都更希望能“一针见血”。
"I was particularly moved at that moment when the patient didn't blame us or deny us for not having had a good injection. Instead, he gave us understanding, tolerance and encouragement.
Play康复患者出院感谢医护人员。
Play convalescent patients discharged from hospital thanks to medical staff.
(00:09)隔离病区里的患者都能理解我们，还总说我们护士不容易，我们也尽可能地给患者最大的关怀。
(00: 09) The patients in the quarantined area can understand us and say that we nurses are not easy, and we care as much as we can for the patients.
记得8床的老爷爷是病区里面病情最重的患者，家里的子女都被感染了在住院。
Remember that the 8-bed grandfather is the most serious patient in the sick area, the children in the family were infected in hospital.
老爷爷身体难受吃不下饭，想喝粥，我们给护士长反应了情况，护士长就和食堂沟通，之后的几天食堂送饭就会另外送一份粥来。
Grandfather's body uncomfortable food, want to drink porridge, we gave the head nurse reaction to the situation, the head nurse and canteen communication, the next few days will be delivered rice porridge.
后来有一天，老爷爷拿了几十块钱出来给我们说：“护士，我也知道你们辛苦，不想麻烦你们，可是我想吃牛肉味的泡面，能不能帮我买下，我给钱给你们。
Then one day, the grandfather took dozens of dollars out to us: "Nurse, I also know you do not want to trouble you, but I would like to eat beef-flavored noodles, can you help me buy it, I give you money.
”当班同事让老爷爷拿着钱回病房休息，立即和外面的同事联系说，8床老爷爷想吃牛肉味的泡面，并让下一班护士带到病房。
"When the colleague asked the grandfather to take the money back to the ward for rest, he immediately contacted his colleagues outside and said that the eight grandfathers wanted beef-flavored noodles and had the next nurse take them to the hospital room.
从2月5日初进隔离病房到19日撤出休整，这期间陆续有病人康复出院，他们临走时会和我们道谢，还有人写感谢信给我们，我们也替为他们的康复感到高兴。
From the beginning of February 5, when the isolation ward was closed until the 19th, when patients were released from the hospital, they thanked us when they left and wrote thank-you notes to us. We are also happy for their recovery.
病人写给护士们的感谢信。
A letter of thanks from the patient to the nurses.
感恩同事与家人的支持在隔离病房工作的这14天，我们有害怕，有焦虑，有欢笑，也有感动。
During the 14 days we worked in the isolation ward, we were afraid, anxious, laughing and moved.
同事之间无论是在生活上还是工作上都相互帮助，我们休息时，会为即将下班的同事准备吃的，也会一起在有限的空间里进行锻炼。
Colleagues help each other both in life and at work. When we relax, we prepare food for our colleagues who are leaving work, and exercise together in limited space.
从2月5日进隔离病房到现在在酒店隔离，这期间我都不能回家。
From February 5 into the isolation ward until now in isolation in the hotel, during which time I can not go home.
家里老人不在身边，全靠我老公在家带孩子。
The old man is not around and depends on my husband to bring up the children at home.
他不怎么会做饭，所以我在家里提前准备了一些零食水果和很多简单的食材给他，也备好了孩子吃的食物。
He didn't know much about cooking, so I prepared some snacks and fruits and many simple ingredients for him ahead of time at home.
其实我最担心的还是孩子，他不到一岁半，是最调皮的时候。
In fact, I was most worried about the children, he is less than a year and a half, is the most naughty time.
果不其然，我走后不到一个星期，儿子额头摔青了，看到他摔伤的照片，我很心疼，但更多的是害怕。
Sure enough, less than a week after I left, my son had a bruise on the forehead, and I was heartbroken to see the picture of his fall, but more scared.
我再三嘱咐老公，一定要注意家里的一切危险因素。
I told my husband again and again to pay attention to all the dangerous factors in the family.
最后还是不放心，把处理意外和自救方法的相关知识都发给了他去学习。
Finally, I was not sure, I sent him some knowledge about how to deal with accident and self-help.
很庆幸在这段一线抗疫的日子里，有同事们能一起互相帮助、互相鼓励，分享每一天的感动和害怕，也特别感谢老公照顾家庭，支持我的工作，做我坚强的后盾。
I am glad that on this first day of fighting against SARS, some colleagues can help each other, encourage each other, share the moving and fear of each day, and especially thank my husband for taking care of my family, supporting my work and giving me strong backing.
护士们为即将下班的同事准备水果。
The nurses prepared fruit for their colleagues who were leaving work.
在酒店休整7到14天后，我们就又将重新穿上防护服、戴上护目镜回到医院的隔离病房抗击疫情，虽然有害怕，但是一想到患者的体谅、同事的陪伴还有家人的支持，我就又觉得信心满满。
After seven to 14 days, we'll be back in protective gear and goggles to fight the epidemic in the isolation ward of the hospital. I feel full of confidence as I think of the patient's understanding, the company of my colleagues and the support of my family.
