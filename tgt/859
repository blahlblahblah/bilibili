从武汉封城之日起，三十多岁的外卖员老计一直在工作。
Wuhan from the closure of the day, more than 30-year-old takeaway staff has been working.
他穿梭在江城的大街小巷，一边送餐，一边用手机记录下自己看到的一切。
He shuttled through the streets of Jiangcheng, delivering meals and recording everything he saw on his mobile phone.
空荡荡的汉街，戏台上有一只狗。
There was a dog on the stage in the empty Hanh Street.
沃尔玛的猪肉档人山人海，“我不敢去，也抢不过”。
Wal-Mart's pork stalls are packed with people. "I'm afraid to go, I can't beat it."
超市的叶子菜卖得快，去晚一点就只剩下土豆、尖椒和洋葱。
Supermarket leafy vegetables sell quickly, leaving potatoes, prickly peppers and onions behind.
路口正中央，停着一辆电动车，朝着汉口的方向。
Right in the middle of the intersection, parked an electric car, toward Hankou direction.
他在微博上用文字和图像讲述他的每日所见。
On Weibo, he used words and images to tell what he saw on a daily basis.
这几天，老计的主要工作是帮人买菜、买肉。
These days, the main work of the old plan is to help people buy vegetables, meat.
但有时也会接一些“奇怪的单”。
But sometimes there are "strange lists."
比如上门给主人不在家的加菲猫清理猫砂、添粮添水。
Such as door to door for the host is not at home Garfield clean cat sand, add food and water.
比如被委托帮忙找到丢失的猫。
Like being asked to help find a lost cat.
那天他八点过出门，花了八小时，用鱼干、猫罐头、袜子，想尽办法找到了它。
He went out at eight o'clock that day and spent eight hours trying to find it with dried fish, cans of cats and socks.
有人留言，“谢谢你们没有放弃那只猫”。
Someone said, "Thank you for not giving up the cat."
以下是老计的口述。
The following is an old story.
···············❶“时间很短，变化很快”我是老计。
"The Times are short and the changes are fast" I am an old plan.
武汉一名普通的外卖骑手。
Wuhan is an ordinary take-out rider.
我只有一个微博@计六一六。
I only have one tweet @ 616.
微博上的图片，都是我用我的破烂工作手机拍摄。
The pictures on the microblog were taken by me on my tattered cell phone.
文字都是真实故事。
Words are true stories.
我的微博是去年7月注册的，就是为了记录外卖骑手们的故事。
My blog was registered last July to document the story of the takeaway riders.
但真正开始记录，是从疫情开始之后。
But the real beginning of the record is since the outbreak began.
那时酒精和84消毒液断货，问了十几个药店都没有。
At that time alcohol and disinfectant 84 were out of stock, asked a dozen pharmacies are not.
（摄于1月28日）1月20号之前，武汉的街景，和全国其他地方一模一样，没有任何区别。
Before January 20, the streets of Wuhan were exactly the same as the rest of the country, without any difference.
钟南山讲话之后，就有变化了。
After Zhong Nan Shan spoke, there was a change.
1月21号一大早，便利店的单子突然变得特别多，打开一看，全是买口罩的。
In the early morning of January 21st, the list of convenience stores suddenly became so large that it was all about buying masks.
那天，我下楼买一罐粥，没戴口罩。
That day, I went downstairs to buy a can of porridge without a mask.
便利店老板强制性送了我一个棉口罩。
The convenience store owner gave me a cotton mask compulsively.
我知道这种口罩基本没什么用，但戴上后也挺暖和。
I know this mask is basically useless, but it's also quite warm after wearing it.
时间很短，变化很快。
The time is short and the changes are fast.
你知道吗？1月21号，我们才意识到情况这么严重。
You know, it was on January 21st that we realized how serious the situation was.
23号，就封城了。
Twenty-three, it's closed.
1月24号，我去沃尔玛购物，看见所有人都戴上口罩，交谈也尽量缩短。
On January 24, I went shopping at Wal-Mart and saw everyone wearing masks and talking as short as possible.
前一天，都不是这样的，街上都还有很多人不戴口罩。
That was not the case the day before, and there were plenty of people in the streets not wearing masks.
陆续开始，外卖就不能放在家门口了。
From now on, take-out can't be left on the doorstep.
开始有那么一两个小区不让进，直到后来全部都不让进。
At first there were one or two small areas that were not allowed to enter until later.
空荡荡的汉街，大戏台也寂寞了很久。
The empty Hanjie, the stage has also been lonely for a long time.
一只狗在戏台上晒太阳。
A dog was sunbathing on the stage.
（摄于2月4日）这条江是长江，对面是汉口。
This river is the Changjiang River, which is opposite Hankou.
我很久没去了。
I haven't been there for a long time.
（摄于2月3日）以前，我天天在过江隧道旁边等单，过去就是汉口，但我从来没走过。
Before (Feb. 3), I waited by the river tunnel every day. It used to be Hankou, but I never walked through it.
现在它封闭了。
Now it's closed.
武昌和汉口原来很近，现在好像非常非常远。
Wuchang and Hankou used to be very close. Now they seem very, very far away.
沃尔玛猪肉档人太多，我不敢去，也抢不过。
Wal-Mart has too many pork stalls. I dare not go there.
换了个地方买，五家人分，也不知道能吃几天。
Change a place to buy, five families share, do not know can eat a few days.
（摄于2月8日）年前我就留在武汉，想多赚点钱。
I stayed in Wuhan a few years ago, hoping to make more money.
平台有一个冬季送餐挑战赛，两季，13期，每一期7天。
The platform has a two-season, 13-issue 7-day winter delivery challenge.
只要不中断，奖金可能达到六七千，我平时工资也就五六千。
As long as there is no interruption, the bonus may reach six or seven thousand, my usual wages are five or six thousand.
现在，我第三期已经完成了，拿了大概一千。
Now, I've finished the third part. I've got about a thousand.
费好大劲儿！不算多，也不算少，相当于多了一个月生活费。
Not too much, not too little, a month more than the cost of living.
这几天接的最多的单是跑腿单，传统的送餐很少了。
These days the most pick up only run errands, the traditional delivery of food is very few.
昨天，我九点多就起床。
I got up at more than nine yesterday.
超市十点开门，去晚了就没了。
The supermarket opens at ten o'clock and goes late.
到了沃尔玛，好多人在等。
When we got to Wal-Mart, many people were waiting.
我首先奔猪肉档，立刻傻眼了。
I ran to the pork stall first. I was stupid right away.
已经人挤人！我不敢去挤。
It's crowded! I'm afraid to squeeze.
也知道抢不过叔叔阿姨们，就在隔壁牛肉档先买牛肉，七十多一斤，据说是好肉。
Also know to rob uncles and aunts, buy beef in next door first, 70 more than a catty, said to be good meat.
一个阿姨在买鸡，不断问工作人员各种问题。
An aunt was buying a chicken and kept asking the staff questions.
我装好了四袋鸡胸肉、四袋鸡腿肉，打完称，阿姨的鸡还没挑好。
I packed four bags of chicken breast, four bags of chicken leg meat, said the aunt's chicken has not been selected.
自助收银机排队，人很多。
There are lots of people in the cash register.
一个阿姨不停推我，让我赶紧，“走快点哈”。
An aunt keeps pushing me, let me hurriedly, "walk quickly Ha".
旁边一个大爷跟工作人员热火朝天地吵起来，武汉话，我也听不懂。
Beside a big man and the staff members are quarrelling, Wuhan dialect, I also do not understand.
直到我出去了，还没吵完。
Till I'm out, it's not over.
砂糖橘这样一袋，只要五块钱！我知道后，并不开心，有点担心。
Sugar orange such a bag, only five dollars! I know, not happy, a little worried.
（摄于2月3日）十一点半，我帮人买药送药。
At half past eleven, I helped buy medicine and deliver it.
从徐东送到八公里以外的地方，因为他那边，已经买不到药了。
From Xudong to eight kilometers away, because he has no access to medicine.
看了下奥司他韦，118一盒。
See lower oseltamivir, 118 boxes.
顾客要了两盒。
The customer asked for two boxes.
财大后门，排队量体温进门。
Financial backdoor, line up to take your temperature.
两个穿防护服的保安一直在吵架。
Two security guards in protective clothing have been quarrelling.
一个好像说要辞职，另一个不时说滚蛋。
One said he was quitting, the other said no.
俩人越靠越近，好像随时会打起来。
The closer they got, the more likely it was that they would fight.
最后，什么都没发生。
In the end, nothing happened.
又骂骂咧咧渐行渐远。
And my swearing is fading away.
干干净净的大街。
A clean street.
疫情中心的武汉，春节的武汉，雨中的武汉。
The center of the epidemic situation in Wuhan, Spring Festival in Wuhan, the rain in Wuhan.
很安静。
It's quiet.
（摄于1月26日）❷“现在还在工作的骑手，多少都会有些自豪”日子就是这样。
"The jockeys who are still working are going to be a bit proud of themselves," says Zou.
我是兼职骑手。
I'm a part-time rider.
每个月没有固定工资，跑一单有一单的钱，不跑就没有。
Every month there is no fixed salary, running a single piece of money, do not run.
我们平台，最主要的工作是送餐。
Our platform, the most important work is to deliver meals.
但是也会有一些奇奇怪怪的跑腿单，帮买、帮送。
But there are also freaky running errands that help buy and deliver.
我听说有的人下单，就是让我们来聊天。
I heard that some people order just to let us talk.
或者下个单呢，凑人头。
Or the next one. put your head together.
你懂了吧？冒充一下顾客之类的。
You got it? Impersonating a customer or something.
武汉街景。
Wuhan Street View.
（摄于2月2日）大年三十晚上，我给自己放了个假，没接单。
(Feb. 2) On the evening of New Year's Eve, I took a vacation for myself and didn't take the order.
我也没有看春晚。
I didn't watch the gala either.
一个人在武汉家里，看电视剧、刷微博。
A person in Wuhan home, watching TV plays, brushing micro-blogging.
看到一个视频，一线医护年三十儿吃泡面。
See a video of a 30-year-old first-line doctor eating noodles.
我转发时说“作为一名武汉的外卖小哥觉得很愧疚！对不起！”我不是一个，或者说我不会把自己装成一个很高尚、一心为他人的人。
I forward to say: "As a Wuhan take-out brother feel very guilty! Sorry!" I am not, or I will not pretend to be a very noble, dedicated to others.
没有这样的人，你知道吧？我们都是普通人。
There are no such people, you know? We're all ordinary people.
直到今天，依然恍惚有种不真实感，又仿佛在做一场一直无法醒来的噩梦。
To this day, there is still a kind of trance is not real, and seems to be doing a nightmare has been unable to wake up.
（摄于2月6日）我喜欢跟街上的人交谈，这是我个人的习惯。
(Feb. 6) I like to talk to people on the street. It's my personal habit.
首先，它是一个获得信息的方式，其次你可以稍微放松一下，换一个频道。
First, it's a way to get information, and second, you can relax a little bit and switch to another channel.
因为工作有时候还是蛮累、蛮辛苦的。
Because sometimes the work is still quite tired, quite hard.
1月30日晚上，我路过武汉理工大学宿舍楼。
On January 30, I passed the dormitory building of Wuhan Polytechnic University.
十四栋的女生宿舍还亮着很多灯，能看见晾着很多衣服。
Fourteen girls' dorms still have many lights on and they can see a lot of clothes drying.
也许是春节期间留校的同学。
Maybe those who stayed at school during Spring Festival.
武汉理工的女生都很好的，即使我偶尔超时，也从不介意。
Wuhan Polytechnic girls are very good, even if I occasionally overtime, never mind.
想起之前夏天的时候，在湖大送单时，遇到两个女生拿好多东西，拿不动。
Think of the previous summer, in the lake when the bill, met two girls with a lot of things, can not carry.
说是在换寝室。
Said it was a change of bedroom.
我去帮他们搬。
I'm going to help them move.
聊过后知道她们是要留在武汉打暑假工。
After the chat know that they are to stay in Wuhan to work summer vacation.
冬天了，不知道她们有没有回家？武汉理工大学亮着灯。
Winter, do not know whether they have returned home? Wuhan Polytechnic University lights.
（摄于1月30日）1月31日中午，我在青山马路边上晒太阳等单，一个很老的阿姨指着我，跟旁边很老的叔叔说着什么，我只听见“吃饭……外卖……”说完之后，那个阿姨就对着我喊，现在还能点外卖啊？那我们吃饭就可以点外卖了？我就回答她说，是啊，都可以点外卖，一直可以点外卖。
At noon on Jan. 31, I was sunbathing on the side of a green hill road. An old aunt pointed at me and said something to my elderly uncle.
她没说什么，两个人一起慢慢地走远了。
She said nothing, and the two walked slowly away together.
我不是说我很感动，我会有小小的触动。
I'm not saying I'm touched. I'll be a little touched.
我回答她，“可以点”，这三个字是在回答问题。
I answered, "Yes," and these three words answered the question.
但是“一直都可以点”，就是表达了我的情感。
But "always can point" is to express my feelings.
没有那么高大上，没有那么伟大。
Not so tall, not so great.
很简单。
It's very simple.
就是在这个特殊的时刻，我们外卖员还在工作。
It was at this particular moment that our take-out staff was still at work.
我们还在坚守岗位。
We're still on duty.
可能带一点自豪感，其他没有那么多了。
Maybe a little proud. There's not that much else.
其实不管大家说还是没说，表达还是没有，现在还在工作的骑手，多少都会有些自豪。
In fact, no matter whether we say or not, the expression is still not, the rider is still working, more or less proud.
方圆五百米都没有人，想给自己拍这张照片，费了很大的劲儿。
No one was in the 500-meter radius, and it took a lot of effort to take this picture for myself.
猜猜我是怎么拍的？（摄于2月7日）❸“骑手的工作，还挺有意思”我之前是做生意的。
Guess how I did it? (Feb. 7) Chaired "The Horseman Job, It's Interesting." I was in business before.
做生意失败了，欠了好多钱，整个人陷入低落的情绪无法自拔。
Business failed, a lot of money was owed, and the mood was one of depression.
状态不好了，特别自闭。
I'm not in good shape. Special shut-ins.
必须要做点改变。
Something has to change.
当时，能做的选择很少。
At the time, few options were available.
一个人心胸越开阔，可以做的选择就越多。
The wider one's mind, the more choices one can make.
但是当你压抑、思想钻了牛角尖，你可以做的选择就越少。
But the fewer options you have to make when you suppress your thoughts.
另一方面，我觉得我需要走出来去跟这个社会多交流、多融入。
On the other hand, I feel I need to go out and talk to the society and get more involved.
我必须要做些事情去改变，不是坐在家里想。
I have to do something to change, not sit at home and think.
就是这样。
That's it.
所以，我来了武汉做骑手。
So I came to Wuhan to be a rider.
最早做的是饿了么的专职骑手。
The first thing I did was a full-time rider who was hungry.
后来九月份才做美团的兼职骑手，一直到现在。
He was a part-time rider of the American Troupe only in September and still is.
有人问我为啥美团骑手用饿了么的餐箱？因为它好用，一直没换。
Someone asked me why the rider was hungry? Because it was so easy to use and it never changed.
我的车，装太多东西，差点压翻两回。
My car, with so much stuff, almost doubled.
这个时段，还能接单跑腿买菜买肉的骑手不多了，请珍惜他们。
At this time, but also can pick up an errand to buy vegetables and meat riders are not many, please cherish them.
（摄于2月10日）骑手的工作，其实还挺有意思的。
(Feb. 10) The rider's job is actually fun.
还有就是，自由。
And then there is freedom.
专职骑手是被动接单，是被动的。
The full-time rider is passive and passive.
我们等着它派单。
We're waiting for it to be delivered.
兼职骑手是你完全可以自主掌握，可以不接单，可以选择什么时候接单。
Part-time rider is you can completely master, can not take orders, can choose when to take orders.
这是我后来做兼职骑手的原因。
That's why I became a part-time jockey.
被动和主动有很大区别，同样都是做一件很累的事。
There is a big difference between being passive and being active, just as much as doing a very tiring job.
你主动选择，就不会特别累。
If you choose, you won't be particularly tired.
如果是被动给你，心里面抵触，那就感觉很累。
If it is passive to you, the heart of the resistance, then feel very tired.
当时，其实没有把送外卖当成一个持久的工作选择。
At the time, delivery was not considered a permanent work option.
一直坚持做，是因为第一，确实暂时没有更好的，或者愿意做的工作。
Keep doing it because first, there really isn't a better, or willing, job for the time being.
另外就是，觉得自己还没调整好。
The other thing is, I don't think I've adjusted.
但疫情之后，我发现骑手的意义有了新的变化。
But after the epidemic, I found a new meaning for riders.
不光光是送个餐那么简单。
It's not just a meal.
我可以解决很多顾客的实际困难，会有更多的社会意义或者是成就感。
I can solve many practical difficulties of customers, there will be more social significance or a sense of accomplishment.
帮顾客买了几斤马蹄（这是广东叫法），我家乡把这东西叫不及儿。
To help customers buy a few catties of horseshoe (this is the name of Guangdong), my hometown can not call this thing children.
我把它放在602的门前。
I left it in front of 602.
（摄于2月6日）2月1日，我朋友接了一个送餐订单。
Feb. 6) My friend took an order for a meal on February 1.
他刚接了单，顾客就取消了订单，紧接着就打电话过来，“我下单不是为了点餐，是为了找人帮我抓猫”。
No sooner had he taken the order than the customer cancelled it and immediately called. "I didn't order anything to order, just to get someone to help me catch the cat."
他猫丢了。
He lost his cat.
一般，越特殊的情况，也许酬劳就会越好。
In general, the more special the situation, perhaps the better the remuneration.
我也喜欢做。
I like to do it, too.
我喜欢接这种奇怪的单子，因为普通的送餐工作很无聊的（我们大部分的时候都很无聊）。
I like to take this odd list because regular food delivery is boring (we're bored most of the time).
一大早，我们三个人信誓旦旦地出发。
Early in the morning, the three of us set out in earnest.
扫楼之后，发现那只叫年糕的猫跑到了天台。
After sweeping the building, the cat, called the New Year cake, ran to the roof.
我把门关上，用猫罐头诱惑它，它看都不看。
I shut the door and enticed him with cans of cat. He didn't even look.
找了双袜子用电线绑起来甩，就看了一眼，还是一动不动。
I found a pair of socks tied up with a wire, looked at it, still motionless.
兄弟，你想怎样？我驱赶它，它居然从没关上的小门，跑到隔壁单元。
Brother, what do you want? I drove it, it never closed the door, ran to the next unit.
这个楼有它娘的三十三层！我爬不动啦！下午，我们再次出动。
There are thirty-three floors of his mother's in this building! I can't climb! In the afternoon, we are out again.
五个小时后，还是抓着了。
Five hours later, I got it.
每人拿到180块酬劳。
We got 180 bucks each.
抓猫小队再次出动。
Catch team's coming out again.
小年糕你这回可跑不掉了吧？（摄于2月1日）回来的路上，经过湖大老乡鸡。
Can't you get away with the little cake this time? (Feb. 1) On your way back, you pass the Hutchison Chicken.
一群饿了么骑手，骑着满得都盖不住的餐箱鱼贯而过。
A group of hungry riders rode past on the overstuffed diner.
好羡慕他们能给前线的医护专门送餐。
I envy them for bringing special meals to the front-line medical staff.
天下骑手是一家，兄弟们真棒。
The riders are a family. It's great guys.
这几天，骑手们也在群里聊天。
These days, the riders were chatting in the group.
每天的感染人数啊，疫情啊。
The number of infections every day! the epidemic.
有很多骑手回家了，也还有在跑单的。
There were a lot of riders home, and there were also runners.
大家就发家里的照片，“今天吃肉、喝酒，不用出门！”有的骑手从武汉离开回家，被隔离了14天，还要签字。
They handed out pictures of their families, "Eat and drink today, don't go out!" Some riders left Wuhan, were isolated for 14 days, and then signed.
我还有个黄陂的兄弟，去雷神山干活了。
I also have a Huangpi brother, to work in Lui Shenshan.
之前我们吵过架，好久不说话。
We had a fight before, and we didn't talk for a long time.
但当时还是希望他加油。
But I still wanted him to cheer.
❹“我看到了最真实的武汉”1月27号晚上，我丢了东西。
"I saw the most authentic Wuhan" January 27 night, I lost something.
当时接了两个订单，一个到酒店，一个送零食到邻近的小区。
There were two orders, one to the hotel and one to a nearby neighborhood.
酒店在二楼，马路边，我上去花不了一两分钟。
The hotel is on the second floor, on the side of the road.
零食很多，餐箱盖不住，我就把上盖就搭在上面，开着口。
Snack a lot, the food box can not cover, I put the top cover on it, open mouth.
一下楼，就发现上面的一小袋零食被拿走了。
As soon as I went downstairs, I found a small bag of snacks on top was taken away.
旁边转了一圈，也没看见人。
I walked around and I didn't see anyone.
丢了50多块钱的东西。
Lost more than 50 bucks.
顾客给我打电话，问我这个钱是我赔还是美团赔？如果是美团赔，他就去申请索赔，如果最后导致我受损失，他就不去申请。
The customer called me and asked me if I was paying for the money or was the tour paying for it? If it was the US Mission, he applied for compensation and if it resulted in a loss to me, he would not apply.
我说最近因为疫情，平台政策宽松了，我不确定。
I said recently because of the epidemic, platform policy is relaxed, I am not sure.
我不知道他怎么做了。
I don't know what he did.
但最后，平台没有扣我的钱。
But in the end, the platform didn't withhold my money.
过了两天，发了通知，说因为疫情，这期间的一些赔偿都可以免除。
Two days later, notice was given that some compensation during this period could be waived because of the outbreak.
我之前也有同事送餐路上丢过餐的，放了几个餐在一单送，丢一个。
I also had a colleague on the way to the delivery of food, put a few meals in a single delivery, lost one.
这很正常，做骑手嘛。
It's normal to be a rider.
也有朋友因此生气，就去调监控、蹲点，结果很尴尬——抓住了那个偷餐的人，是一个老年拾荒者。
Some friends are angry about this, to adjust the monitoring, squat, the result is very embarrassing - caught the thief, is an old scavenger.
你能怎么办？让他赔，还是打他一顿、骂他一顿？你什么都做不了。
What can you do? Give him compensation, or give him a good beating and a good scolding? You can't do anything.
最后，就让他走了。
Finally, let him go.
所以我知道，去找是没有意义的。
So I know, there's no point in looking.
我发了一条微博，“希望这一小袋零食，真是被需要的人拿走。
I posted a microblog saying, "I hope this little bag of snacks is really taken away by someone who needs it.
你能吃饱，我也开心。
You can eat full, I am happy.
但是也请以后对我们骑手网开一面吧！红尘多难，同舟共济！”送完这单，没估算好电量。
But also please later on our rider net one side! Red dust how difficult, together with the boat! "Send this order, did not estimate good electricity.
车抛锚了。
The car broke down.
我推着车走了三公里。
I wheeled the car for three kilometers.
换好了电池，在路边抽烟，背后的楼上，有人在喊：武汉加油！麻蛋，烟熏了眼睛。
Changed the battery, smoking in the roadside, behind the upstairs, someone was shouting: Wuhan refueling!
发微博多了后，很多人开始关注我。
A lot of people began to pay attention to me after I got micro-blogging.
一天上午，我帮一个女生买枇杷膏，下午又帮她买了连花清瘟胶囊、奥司他韦和阿莫西林。
One morning, I helped a girl buy loquat ointment, and in the afternoon I helped her buy Lianhuaqing Capsule, oseltamivir and amoxicillin.
我把药放在她家门边的楼梯上。
I left the medicine on the stairs near her door.
她说，“我看了你的微博，我哭了，你拍的很多照片都是我每天要走的路”。
"I saw your tweet, I cried, and many of the pictures you took were my daily paths," she said.
她咳嗽，但不发烧，在家自我隔离。
She coughed but did not have a fever and isolated herself at home.
她说害怕，几乎每天都哭。
She said she was scared and cried almost every day.
我告诉她，外头没那么严重，只要你做好预防，就没什么问题。
I told her it wasn't that serious outside, so long as you took precautions, there was nothing wrong.
你可能是感冒，即使是染上病毒，年轻人也不会有太大问题，诸如此类。
You may have a cold, even if infected with the virus, young people will not have too much problems, and so on.
看看这温暖的阳光，想想这烟火十足的人世间，还有那么多美食、美景。
Look at the warm sunshine, think of the fireworks full of people, there are so many delicious food, beautiful scenery.
武汉不孤独，你也不会孤独。
Wuhan is not lonely, you will not be lonely.
我又推荐了一些美剧给她，《24小时》、《老友记》。
I also recommended some American dramas to her, "24 Hours," "Friends."
这都是我喜欢看的。
That's what I love to see.
我还喜欢看《请回答1988》，但我没推荐这部。
I also like "Please answer 1988," but I don't recommend this one.
因为这个时候看，不合适。
Because at this moment, it's not right.
它是在岁月静好的时候做回忆用的。
It is used for remembering when the years are quiet.
你会越看越伤感。
The more you look at it, the sadder you look.
这个时候就应该看一些激烈的，让人开心的，动作戏啊。
This is the time to watch some intense, entertaining, action plays.
看了之后，让你忘记现实的那种，最好了。
After reading, let you forget the kind of reality, the best.
路口正中停了一辆电动车，没看见骑车的人，也没人围观，倔强的朝向汉口的方向，孤单的一动不动。
In the middle of the intersection stopped an electric car, did not see bicyclists, no one around, stubborn toward Hankou direction, lonely motionless.
（摄于2月3日）但我作为外卖骑手，在外面，看到的还是最真实的部分。
(Taken on Feb. 3) But as a take-out rider, what I saw outside was the most authentic part.
一天下午，送桥梁村的单，经过武昌医院。
One afternoon, sent to the bridge village of Shan, passing Wuchang Hospital.
我看到一辆救护车停在医院门口，一个身穿防护服的医护人员对担架上的人做心脏按压。
I saw an ambulance parked in front of the hospital and a paramedic in protective clothing pressed the heart of the man on the stretcher.
路口，一个中年人手里提着一袋片子，背着一个年纪大点的人走。
