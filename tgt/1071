作为一名旅居海外的华侨，游和洲心系祖国和家乡，为在第一时间抢购口罩，他放下原本的外贸生意，组织员工以最快的速度紧急搜集苏门答腊岛、爪哇岛、苏拉威西岛、加里曼丹岛等岛内的医用口罩，1月23日起，仅用两天时间，就收购了2万多只口罩，准备捐给家乡的温州市苍南县人民医院。

收购的口罩整装待发时，他们碰到了难题：因为运费极其昂贵，最好是有人坐飞机带回国内，但面对此时疫情形势严峻的中国，当地无人愿意担此重任。
When the purchased masks were ready to go, they had a problem: because the cost of transportation was prohibitive, it would be better for someone to fly home, but no one in China was willing to take on the task at a time when the epidemic was severe.
正一筹莫展之际，赵珺延提出：“舅舅，让我来吧。

”妈妈游小敏被儿子打动了，虽然有些担心，但更多的是对小小男子汉的信任，2月2日印尼政府发布通知2月5日12点开始关闭中国往返的所有航班，时间紧急，游小敏赶紧帮儿子抢回国机票，终于抢到了一张2月3日23点的机票，事后才知道，这已是目前印尼飞往中国的最后一架航班。

可是工作人员告诉他，要自己把货物拉到机场的预定集合地。

他立刻取出手机查定位，距离目的地有500多米。
He immediately took out his mobile phone and located it, more than 500 meters from his destination.
面对着5个大箱子，赵珺延很为难……最后，他找来两辆推车，将5个箱子搬上了车，一鼓作气推起了两辆推车，可是总有一个箱子不听话，不停地往下掉。
