AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
多位试图通过实体药店、电商平台、微商购买口罩的消费者，在疫情面前，却不约而同地买到了假口罩。
Many consumers trying to buy masks through physical pharmacies, electronic commerce platforms, micro-merchants, in the face of the epidemic, but coincidentally bought fake masks.
这些口罩中，有是伪造的3M，有的是被正版厂家“声明为假”的版本，有的是生产日期出现“穿越”的口罩。
Some of these masks are fake 3M, others are "false" versions by legitimate manufacturers, and still others are "through" masks on production dates.
值得警惕的是，与此同时，这些假口罩还流入了捐赠给正处疫情一线的湖北医院的物资中。
At the same time, alarmingly, the masks were pouring into supplies donated to Hubei hospital, which is on the front line of the epidemic.
至少三个向湖北医院捐赠物资的募捐团队向清流工作室表示，其在筹备物资过程中碰到了提供假冒口罩的商家。
At least three collection teams that donated supplies to Hubei hospitals told the workshop that they had run into vendors providing fake masks while preparing supplies.
其中一个团队把买到的口罩捐赠给医院后，却收到医院反馈称，这些口罩是“三无产品”。
One team donated the masks to the hospital, but received feedback from the hospital that the masks were "three non-products."
四处泛滥的假口罩背后，存在着一条隐秘的口罩产业链。
Behind the ubiquitous mask is a hidden chain of masks.
清流工作室发现，在批发平台上，多家厂家号称可以提供贴牌代工服务，“logo”等标志可以定制。
Cleaning studio found that in the wholesale platform, a number of manufacturers claim to be able to provide OEM services, "logo" and other signs can be customized.
一家没有生产医用口罩资质的工厂告知清流工作室，他们可以生产医用的N95口罩。
A factory that is not qualified to make medical masks told Cleaning Studios they could produce N95 surgical masks for medical use.
然而，在严峻的疫情面前，一些已被证实售卖假口罩的工厂，现阶段产品也已经全部售空。
However, in the face of a severe epidemic, some factories that have been proven to sell fake masks have now sold out.
这意味着，大量假口罩已经流入市场。
That means a lot of fake masks are already on the market.
肆虐蔓延的假口罩一周前，李丽在微信群加了一个号称卖3M口罩的微商，花了1800块下单了150个9001型号口罩。
A week ago, Li Li added a purportedly 3M mask vendor to Weixin Group and ordered 150 9001 masks for 1,800 yuan.
收到口罩时，她马上就后悔了。
When she received the mask, she immediately regretted it.
经跟3M正版口罩比对，9001型号的口罩本该是KN90口罩，而她收到的口罩包装上却全部都打了“KN95”的标识。
Compared with the 3M mask, 9001 was supposed to be a KN90 mask, while all the masks she received bore the "KN95" label on the packaging.
她找到微商，微商承认了售假，并求她不要把自己举报出去。
She went to the micromerchant, who admitted the sale and begged her not to report it to him.
目前，清流工作室以购买口罩的名义加了这位微商的微信，发现她仍在售卖3M口罩。
Now, the purge studio has added a micro-businessman's letter in the name of buying masks and found that she is still selling 3M masks.
微商向清流工作室表示，由于口罩紧缺，目前向她下单只能每天买几个。
Micro-quotient to clear flow studio, because of the shortage of masks, she can only order a few a day.
陈舟也买到了假的3M口罩。
Chen Zhou also bought a fake 3M mask.
她在一家名为“鸣连居家日用专营店”的淘宝店花178元买了25个3M口罩。
She bought 25 3M masks for 178 yuan at a Taobao store, called Ming Liang Daily Store.
收到货时，她在3M的公众号上查了一下防伪码，发现全是假的。
When she received the shipment, she checked the security code on the public number 3M and found it was all false.
目前，清流工作室在这家淘宝店看到，“宝贝分类”一栏还显示着3M口罩的图片，但店里已经找不到口罩商品的链接了。
At the Taobao store, the purge shop now sees pictures of 3M masks in the "Baby Classification" column, but it can't find a link to the mask item.
无独有偶，在淘宝店“盈顺医疗器械专营店”上，赵鹏也买到了假的一次性医用口罩。
Not coincidentally, in Taobao shop "Yingshun Medical Device Specialized Shop," Zhao Peng also bought fake disposable medical masks.
他收到货物是1月27号，让他哭笑不得的是，口罩包装打上的生产日期却显示是2月6日。
He received the goods on January 27 and, to his chagrin, the mask was packaged on a production date that showed February 6.
目前，“盈顺医疗器械专营店”上的口罩产品已经下架。
At present, "Yingshun Medical Device Store" on the mask products have been removed from shelves.
该淘宝店客服告诉清流工作室，店里口罩已经卖完。
The Taobao Shop customer service told the clean-up studio that the store had sold out of masks.
假口罩也出现在实体药店之中。
Fake masks also appear in physical pharmacies.
家在安徽淮南的吴玮在老家的一间药店买到了假冒的“飘安牌”口罩。
WU Wei, who lives in Huainan, Anhui Province, bought a fake Flying Safe mask at a drug store in his hometown.
不久后，他通过河南飘安集团对外声明的新闻，才发现正版的“飘安牌”口罩根本没有他所买到的包装。
Soon after, he found that the genuine version of the "Piao An brand" mask had no packaging he had bought through news announced by the Henan Piao'an Group.
吴玮的经历并非孤例，多位安徽网友均向清流工作室表示，他们在实体药店不约而同地买到了假的“飘安牌”口罩。
Wu Wei's experience is not unique, many Anhui netizens to clear the flow studio, they in the entity pharmacy coincidentally bought a fake "fluttering brand" mask.
令其中一位消费者气愤的是，在药店里，“假飘安”竟然也抬高价格售出。
To the annoyance of one of the consumers, "Flying Away" sold at the drugstore.
更值得警惕的是，一些正在为疫情前线的湖北医院筹备物资的募捐团队，也遇到了售假口罩商家。
Even more alarming is that some are preparing supplies for the Hubei hospital in the front line of the epidemic, also encountered vendors selling fake masks.
一些被送到医院的口罩，被发现是“三无产品”。
Some of the masks that were brought to the hospital were found to be "three no products."
马崇道的募捐团队组建于1月25日，刚成立便紧急筹备一批医用防护物资，用以捐赠给湖北疫区的医院。
Ma Chong Road's fund-raising team was set up on January 25, and had just set up an emergency batch of medical protection materials for donation to hospitals in Hubei Province.
次日凌晨，团队成员紧急联系上一位号称做外贸进出口的口罩批发商，对方声称有医用口罩可以提供。
Early the next morning, team members contacted a mask wholesaler purporting to import and export foreign trade, claiming that they had medical masks to offer.
成员收到批发商发来的口罩货品图片，发到团队的微信群让群友甄别。
Members receive a picture of the mask item from the wholesaler and send it to the team's microphone group for screening.
不料，一位有医护背景的成员一眼就判断出，口罩不符合医用标准。
Unexpectedly, a member with a medical background decided at a glance that the mask did not meet medical standards.
“这个事情我越想越害怕。
"The more I think about it, the more I fear it.
”马崇道向清流工作室表示，批发商曾告知他们，说这批口罩绝无问题，说很多人买来就是发武汉的。
Mr Ma told the purge studio that wholesalers had told them that the masks were in no way a problem and that many had bought them and sent them to Wuhan.
由于批发商朋友圈的视频定位在义乌，事发后他立即向当地公安局进行了举报。
Because the wholesaler friend circle's video localization in Yiwu, after the incident he immediately reported to the local public security bureau.
类似的问题也困扰着一位不愿意具名的公益人士所在的募捐团队。
A similar problem bedevils a collection of unnamed public-interest people.
她向清流工作室表示，此前募捐团队所在的微信群中，一个号称自己有口罩货源的群成员发了货物图片后，被一位黄冈某医院的采购人员质疑了口罩的真实性。
She told Cleanse Studios that a procurement officer at a hospital in Huanggang questioned the mask's authenticity after a group of people who claimed to be the source of the mask had distributed pictures of it.
这位公益人士告诉清流工作室，即便疫区出现物资紧缺的医院公开了具体的型号或标准，但市场上符合标准的口罩产品基本已经卖完，团队成员难以判断目前所能接触到的口罩是否符合要求。
The charity worker told the studio that even if hospitals in affected areas were to disclose specific models or standards, market-standard mask products had been largely sold out, making it difficult for team members to judge whether the masks currently available met the requirements.
此外，正规厂家基本已经没货，志愿者能联系上的厂家鱼龙混杂，而大部分商家要求先付款再发货，存在很大的风险。
In addition, the formal manufacturers are basically out of stock, volunteers can contact the manufacturers mixed, and most businesses demand payment before shipping, there is a great risk.
一个名为“武汉加油·北美留学生组”的募捐团队则买到了假口罩。
A collection of fundraisers called the Wuhan refueling North American Foreign Students Group bought fake masks.
1月25日，该团队向一名许姓口罩商家采购了价值27.5万的5万只KN95-K310口罩，直接发往武汉多家医院。
On 25 January, the team procured 50,000 KN95-K310 masks, valued at 275,000, from a vendor surnamed Xu Mask and sent them directly to Wuhan hospitals.
然而，在口罩送达的一天后，多家医院却向募捐团队反馈，口罩不仅不是N95口罩，而且也不符合厂家提供的质检报告中所提到的N09口罩的质量标准，属于三无产品。
However, a day after the mask was delivered, several hospitals gave feedback to the collection team that it was not only not N95, but also did not meet the quality standards for N09 masks mentioned in the manufacturer's quality report.
该募捐团队的成员向清流工作室表示，事发后团队已经报警。
Members of the fundraising team told Cleaning Studio that the team had alerted police after the incident.
值得一提的是，“武汉加油·北美留学生组”买到的这批假口罩，厂家为广州市威尼科技发展有限公司。
It is worth mentioning that "Wuhan refueling North American students group" bought this fake masks, manufacturers for Guangzhou Winnie Technology Development Co. Ltd.
1月29日，清流工作室以购买口罩的名义联系到这家该公司时，该公司相关负责人告知，厂里的口罩已经全部卖完，而且一段时间内将不再接受订单。
When the company was contacted by Cleaning Studios on January 29 under the name of purchasing masks, the company's executives told them the company had sold out of masks and would not accept orders for some time.
这意味着，或许已有大量的假口罩流入市场。
That means there may already be a flood of fake masks on the market.
隐秘的产业链泛滥成灾的假口罩背后，隐藏着一条鲜为人知的假口罩产业链。
The hidden industrial chain overflows behind a mask, hiding a little-known fake mask industry chain.
清流工作室在阿里巴巴、百度爱采购等批发平台上看到，有多家显示为工厂直销的商家，号称提供定制logo、文案和包装等各类口罩。
Cleaning studio in Alibaba, Baidu love to buy and other wholesale platform, there are a number of direct-selling manufacturers, claiming to provide customized logo, copy and packaging and other types of masks.
其中，一些厂家登出招微商代理的广告。
Among them, some manufacturers advertised the agent of micro-commerce.
其中，至少两家口罩厂家未见其展示3M的授权证书，而清流工作室以进货的名义咨询其是否能定制代工3M时，得到的答复是“可以”。
Among them, at least two mask manufacturers did not see its authorization to display 3M, and the cleaning studio to purchase the name of whether it can customize 3M, the answer is "yes."
清流工作室未能联系上3M中国公司对这些厂家的资质做进一步的核实。
Clearing Studios was unable to contact 3M China to further verify the qualifications of these companies.
至少两位3M公司经销商对清流工作室表示，他们所能接触到的3M公司的授权厂商均已经没有货源，他们也一筹莫展。
At least two 3M dealers told Clearing Studios that none of the 3M companies they had access to had supplies, and they were at a standstill.
其中一位经销商告诉清流工作室，在疫情期间，3M公司的口罩库存资源优先调配至武汉及湖北各地，市场上基本很难买到正版3M口罩。
One of the dealers told Cleaning Studios that during the outbreak, 3M had priority in deploying its mask inventory to Wuhan and other places in Hubei Province, where it was difficult to buy genuine 3M masks.
3M不是唯一被山寨的口罩品牌。
3M is not the only mask brand to be shanzhai.
如前文所述，多位消费者向清流工作室表示，近日在市场上买到了假冒的“飘安牌”口罩。
As mentioned above, many consumers to clean up the studio, recently bought a fake "fluttering brand" mask in the market.
目前，飘安控股河南有限公司已披露了辨别真伪的方法，并发布声明称该公司防护产品主要按保武汉、保湖北、保河南等医疗机构的顺序供应。
At present, Piao An Holdings Henan Co. Ltd. has disclosed the method of identifying truth and falsehood, and issued a statement that the company's protective products are mainly supplied in the order of Bao Wuhan, Bao Hubei, Bao Henan and other medical institutions.
清流工作室在调查中还发现，一些没有生产医疗器械或医用口罩资质的厂家，却号称自己可以提供医用口罩。
The studio also found that some companies that are not qualified to produce medical devices or masks claimed to be able to supply them.
一家名为“苏州金瑞达防护用品有限公司”厂家对清流工作室表示，其可生产医用N95口罩。
"Suzhou Jinrida Protective Products Co., Ltd.," a manufacturer told the workshop that it can produce medical N95 masks.
不过，工商信息显示，这家公司的经营范围为“特种劳动防护用品制造、加工、销售；针纺织品及原料、劳保用品、塑料制品、金属材料及制品购销”等，却未包括“医用口罩”。
However, business information shows that the company's business scope is "special labor protection products manufacturing, processing, sales; knitted textiles and raw materials, labor protection products, plastic products, metal materials and products," but does not include "medical masks.
类似地，前述生产伪冒医用口罩给募捐团队的广州市威尼科技发展有限公司，经营范围为“普通劳动防护用品制造；劳动防护用品批发；劳动防护用品零售”等，同样未包括经营生产医疗器械及口罩。
Similarly, Guangzhou Weini Technology Development Co., Ltd., which produces fake medical masks for fund-raising teams, also does not include the production and manufacture of medical devices and masks.
与此同时，有人回收二手口罩的传言也刺激着公众的神经。
Meanwhile, rumors of people taking second-hand masks are stirring the public's nerves.
1月24日，有网友发布视频，称马鞍山市花鸟市场附近一家劳保用品店收集废旧口罩装箱，疑似回收口罩进行二次销售。
On January 24, a netizen released a video saying that a labor protection store near the Ma On Shan City Flower and Bird Market collects containers for used masks and suspects that they are being re-sold.
1月26日，马鞍山市公安局发布通报称，被查扣的口罩是涉事商店从推销员或本市工厂职工收购的劳保类口罩，因管理不善部分口罩包装损坏，并非二手口罩。
On January 26, the Ma On Shan Public Security Bureau issued a notice saying that the seized face masks, which had been purchased by the shop in question from salesmen or factory workers in the city, had been damaged by mismanagement and were not used as second-hand masks.
据新华社报道，深圳市市场监督局副局长李忠在发布会上通报一起深圳市打击销售假冒口罩案件。
Li Zhong, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Market Supervision, told a news conference that Shenzhen was cracking down on the sale of fake masks, Xinhua reported.
近日有顾客反映深圳位于松岗街道东方工业二路的瑞草堂药店购买到有明显黑色污渍的二手口罩，该店售卖的号称为N95的口罩售价达18元一个。
A customer recently complained that a second-hand mask with obvious black stains had been bought at Shenggang Street East Industrial Road in Shenzhen. The mask, called N95, was sold for $18 each.
执法人员接报后马上进行现场查处，并查获一批没有任何标签、标识、厂名、厂址，却标称N95涉嫌假冒伪劣的口罩700多个。
Law enforcement officials immediately after receiving reports on the scene, and seized a batch without any labels, marks, factory names, factory sites, but claimed that N95 is suspected of counterfeiting more than 700 fake and inferior masks.
通过后续调查发现，这家药店已经卖出1800个这样的“N95口罩”，还有24000个号称是高过滤卫生口罩。
A follow-up investigation revealed that the pharmacy had sold 1,800 such N95 masks and 24,000 claimed high-filtered ones.
清流工作室注意到，截至目前，“回收或售卖二手口罩”的传言未有被证实的案例。
The purge studio notes that so far there have been no confirmed rumors of "recycling or selling second-hand masks."
有人曾在网上发布“高价收购3M口罩”等信息，不过，当清流工作室联系上至少4位从事收购3M口罩的人士时，均被告知其收购的是全新的、未用过的3M口罩。
Some people have posted information such as "Buy 3M masks at high prices" on the Internet, but when the purge studio contacted at least four people involved in the purchase of 3M masks, they were told they were buying brand-new, unused 3M masks.
其中，一位长期收购3M口罩的人士告诉清流工作室，其一般收购的是公司发给工人们的、用不完的劳防用品，业内很少听过有人收购用过的二手口罩。
One longtime buyer of 3M masks told Clear Stream that his company typically buys inexhaustible labor supplies issued to workers, and few in the industry have heard of buying used masks.
口罩市场乱象已久事实上，公开信息显示，早在疫情之前，口罩市场便乱象丛生。
The mask market has been in disarray for a long time. Indeed, public information suggests that the market for masks was in disarray long before the outbreak.
清流工作室在裁判文书网上找到了多则与侵害3M公司商标权、非法制造及销售3M产品有关的案件。
The purge studio found many cases related to infringement of 3M trademark rights, illegal manufacture and sale of 3M products.
其中，一则判决于2016年3月裁判文书显示，2012年8月至2013年5月间，被告林某某通过淘宝网从广东东莞的周某某开的“周氏家族518”购进假冒“3M”品牌的口罩及配件，利用其在淘宝网上开设的“尚青劳保用品批发商行”和“本店只做劳保用品批发”二家网店进行销售，累计销售金额达人民币12万元。
One of the judgements, dated March 2016, showed that between August 2012 and May 2013, defendant Lin bought fake "3M" brand masks and accessories from the Zhou family 518 in Dongguan, Guangdong through Taobao, and used its two online stores, Shang Qing Labor Insurance Wholesaler Shop and Wholesale of Labor Protective Goods only, to sell a total of 120,000 yuan.
另一则判决于2019年1月的裁判文书显示，2016年8月至2017年12月，被告人赵某在未取得3M注册商标所有人许可的情况下，在高密市柏城镇小河崖村厂房内生产假冒的3M注册商标口罩。
Another judgement, issued in January 2019, shows that between August 2016 and December 2017, the accused Zhao produced fake 3M-registered trademark masks at the Park River Village plant in the town of Bai, Gao Mi, without the permission of the owner of the 3M registered trademark.
2016年9月至2017年12月，其将生产的假冒3M注册商标口罩，及其购买的假冒3M3701CN口罩滤棉，加外包装盒后出售给赵某某、冷某，销售金额13.8万元。
Between September 2016 and December 2017, it will produce fake 3M-registered trademark masks and counterfeit 3M3701CN mask filters purchased by it and sell them to Zhao and Lengmou with a sales of 138,000 yuan.
2016年，被告人张某在明知被告人赵某生产假冒注册商标3M口罩的情况下，为被告人赵某制作带有3M9001、3M9002、3M9001V、3M9002V字样的印花模版六块。
In 2016, the defendant, Zhang Mou, knowingly produced fake registered trademark 3M masks for the defendant Zhao Mou, making three M9001, 3M9002, 3M9001V, 3M9002V printing template.
被告人赵某某和冷某在明知是假冒3M的情况下，从赵某处购买了假冒3M产品，后全部销售。
Defendant Zhao and Lengmou knowingly in the case of fake 3M, from somewhere Zhao bought counterfeit 3M products, and then all sold.
判决于2019年8月的一则裁判文书则显示，2013年至2014年间，被告人肖某某未经3M公司许可，非法生产假冒注册商标“3M”口罩94800只，后因口罩质量不过关，便将该批口罩存放于租用的福建省龙海市颜厝镇宅前村郑某家铁皮仓库。
A judgement issued in August 2019 shows that between 2013 and 2014, the defendant, Xiao Mou, illegally produced 94,800 counterfeit registered trademark "3M" masks without the permission of 3M Company. After failing to pass the quality of the masks, he placed them in a tin warehouse in the former village of Yan Cuo Cuo Mansion, Longhai City, Fujian Province.
2016年6月27日，被告人肖某某通过中间人将该批口罩（10000元）以及生产口罩机器（61200元）销售给汪某。
On June 27, 2016, defendant Xiao, through an intermediary, sold the mask (10,000 yuan) and the production machine (61200 yuan) to Wang Mou.
2016年10月，3M中国公司向桐城市公安局报案，称桐城市有数家生产假冒3M牌口罩窝点。
In October 2016, 3M China reported to the Tongcheng Public Security Bureau that several companies in Tong City were producing fake 3M masks.
当日，桐城市经侦大队会同桐城市市场监督管理局对桐城市雅格卫生材料有限公司进行检查，现场查获大量假冒3M口罩成品及半成品。
On the same day, the Tongcheng Economic Investigation Department, together with the Tongcheng City Market Supervision Authority, inspected Tongcheng Yager Sanitary Materials Co. Ltd., and seized a large number of counterfeit 3M mask finished products and semi-finished products.
一位3M经销商告诉清流工作室，判断3M口罩真假，主要看包装上的标签是否反光为天蓝色，以及看包装和纸盒是否字迹清晰，是否有保质期和生产日期在包装的底部或顶部。
A 3M dealer told Cleaning Studio that the 3M mask was genuine, depending on whether the label reflected azure blue and whether the packaging and carton were legible and had a shelf life and a production date at the bottom or top of the packaging.
清流工作室亦注意到，目前，3M已经在官网公布了产品防伪的方法。
Cleaning studio also noted that, at present, 3M has announced the product anti-counterfeiting method on the official website.
业内人士向清流工作室表示，消费者如要判断购买的医用口罩真伪，可以在国家药品监督管理局官网通过查询企业的生产信息、批准文号，查询口罩的详细信息。
If consumers want to judge the authenticity of medical masks purchased, they can check the company's production information, approval number and details of face masks, according to industry sources.
一位不愿具名的医生向清流工作室表示，N95口罩过滤效率达到95%，如果口罩质量不好或者重复使用口罩会使过滤效率降低。
A doctor who declined to be named told Cleaning Studio that the N95 mask filters 95% efficiently and can be made less efficient if the mask is of poor quality or reused.
但她强调，除非是口罩上有病毒，在目前的情况下，即便是假口罩，戴上也比不戴上好。
But unless there is a virus on the mask, even a mask is better than not wearing it under current conditions, she stressed.
