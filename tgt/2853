“多喝热水”“中西医结合”原来是从这里来的。
"Drink lots of hot water" "combination of Chinese and Western medicine" originally came from here.

2007-9-19 16: 16 [hide] www.youtheme.cn [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color] [/ color]
官方宣传中，全国各地都在“深入开展爱国卫生运动，与疫情防治工作相结合”，运动主体上至全国各省市，下到各区县、乡镇、街道。
In official propaganda, people all over the country are carrying out patriotic public health campaigns in depth, combining prevention and treatment with the work of preventing and treating the disease.
“爱国卫生运动”这个词组让人感觉熟悉又陌生：每个词都极其常见，但组合起来一看就是很有年头的说法——把卫生工作上升到爱国的高度，又以发动广大群众的方式开展，固然有其特定历史渊源：这场运动始于1952年抗美援朝时期，由毛泽东“动员起来，讲究卫生，减少疾病，提高健康水平，粉碎敌人的细菌战争”那句著名口号拉开序幕，随后由战时紧急动员演变为一项常规性卫生工作延续至今。
The phrase "patriotic public health movement" is familiar and unfamiliar: every word is extremely common, but taken together it is a very old saying - raising health work to patriotic level and mobilizing the masses, although it has its own historical roots: Mao Zedong's famous slogan "Mobilizing, investigating health, reducing disease, improving health and crushing the enemy's germ wars" started in 1952.
但无论工作内容如何随时代变迁，“群众路线”始终没变——1982年，“开展群众性的卫生活动”写入宪法。
But no matter how the content of the work changes with the times, the "mass line" remains unchanged - in 1982, the "development of mass hygienic activities" was included in the Constitution.
实际上，无论是如今“新冠病毒起源是美国”的阴谋论还是“中西医结合”疗法的实施，“除四害”“赤脚医生”“五讲四美”“门前三包”等具有鲜明时代特征的话语，以及“多喝热水”“勤洗手”“不随地吐痰”“大扫除”等个人卫生习惯的口号，都能在这项影响深远的运动中找到源头。
Indeed, whether the conspiracy theory of "New Crown Virus Origins in the United States" or the implementation of the "Combination of Chinese and Western Medicine" therapy, the slogan of "Drink lots of hot water," "Wash your hands frequently" and "Don't spit anywhere" and "Clean up" can all find their source in this far-reaching campaign.
当下人们拿来调侃的那句“终于到了躺着就能为国家做贡献的时候了”，以及在微博朋友圈发起的“晒凉皮大赛”“烘焙大赛”，未必不是新时代的“群众路线”。
"It's time to lie down and make a contribution to our country," as well as the "Cooking Competition" and "Baking Contest" launched by Weibo's circle of friends, not necessarily the "mass line" of the new era.
01.“麻雀”一词被《毛泽东影响中国的88个关键词》一书作者列为88个词之一。
The word "sparrow" is one of 88 words listed by the authors of Mao Zedong's 88 Key Words for Influencing China.
“麻雀”除了引出毛泽东“解剖麻雀”工作方法的灵感，也是轰轰烈烈的“除四害”运动中命运坎坷的一种动物，被列为“四害”病媒之后又对其正名。
The sparrow, inspired by Mao Zedong's "anatomical sparrow" method of work, is a kind of animal with a bumpy fate in the vigorous "four-hazard" campaign, and has been named after the "four evils" vector.
作者认为，“毛泽东曾为曹操翻案。
Mao Zedong overturned the case for Cao Cao.
替麻雀翻案，跟替曹操翻案的意义一样重大。
To overturn a sparrow is as important as to overturn the case of Cao Cao.
”[1]1956年1月，《人民日报》发表了题为《除四害》的社论，号召全国人民行动起来消灭老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子。
"& # 91; & # 93; & # 93; & # 39; & # 39; In January 1956, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled" Four Hazards, "calling on the nation to take action to eliminate rats, sparrows, flies, and mosquitoes.
以“除四害”为主题的爱国卫生运动作为“卫生领域的人民战争”登上历史舞台。
The patriotic public health campaign with the theme of "four evils" as the "people's war in the field of health" came on the historical stage.
“除四害”期间，“末代皇帝”溥仪正被拘于抚顺战犯管理所，他在自传《我的前半生》里也提到了这段历史，：自从朝鲜和东北发现了美国的细菌弹，全国展开了爱国卫生运动以来，监狱里每年定期地要搞几次除四害、讲卫生的大规模活动。
"In addition to the four harms" period, "the last emperor" Puyi is detained in Fushun war criminals management, he also mentioned in his autobiography "My first half of life": since the discovery of the United States bacteria bombs and the national patriotic health campaign, the prison regularly conducted a number of harm, WASH large-scale activities every year.
这种活动给我留下了许多深刻的印象，其中之一，是我和大李在打苍蝇上发生的一件事。
One of the things that impressed me most about this activity was the fact that Li and I were fighting flies.
那时，监狱里的苍蝇已经不多，我找了一阵，在窗户框上发现了一个，那窗户是打开了的，我用蝇拍一挥，把它赶出去了。
At that time, there were not many flies in the prison. I looked for a while and found one in the window-frame. The window was open.
“你这是干什么？”大李在我身后喊，“你是除四害还是放生？”可见这场爱国卫生运动确实渗透了社会各个角落，团结的阵线不可谓不广泛。
"What are you doing?" Li yelled after me. "Are you doing four harm or letting go?" So the patriotic health movement did infiltrate every corner of society.
从城市到农村，除了工人、农民， 时任中央爱国卫生运动委员会主任的周恩来提出，要充分利用学生的力量。
From urban to rural areas, in addition to workers, farmers, then-director of the Central Patriotic Health Movement Committee Zhou Enlai, to make full use of the power of students.
少年儿童、在校学生们走街串巷，规劝行人注意卫生，不要随地吐痰和乱扔果皮纸屑；他们手执蝇拍、随见随灭的身影，被定格在许多老照片和宣传画里；为“斩草除根”，他们在暗沟河道、茅房四周“找蛆挖蛹”。
Children and adolescents, school students walk the streets, urging pedestrians to pay attention to hygiene, do not spit and litter; they hold the fly racket, see the shadow of death, is fixed in many old photographs and posters; to "weed out roots," they "find maggots to dig pupae" around the gutters and huts.
拿灭鼠来说，当时统计数量以老鼠尾巴为标准，孩子们割掉老鼠的尾巴，用石灰消毒后串成一串，交到学校或居委会，换取一盒火柴作为奖励。
In the case of rodents, the count was based on the tail of a rat, which the children had cut off, disinfected with lime and strung together into a string, delivered to a school or neighborhood committee in exchange for a box of matches.
[2]虽然极富战斗力，但孩子们未必明白这一行动的意义。
Despite its combat prowess, the children did not necessarily understand the significance of the operation.
《北京日报》1958年刊发过一则以《老师是“尾巴主义”，学生放走秃老鼠》为题的一封读者来信，有人反映：有一天我到东郊去，路上碰见几个小学生在捉老鼠。
One day I was on my way to the eastern suburbs when I met some elementary school students catching mice, according to a letter to the editor published in 1958 by the Beijing Daily under the title Teacher is Tail Doctrine and Student Alopecia.
当他们发现这只老鼠没有尾巴，就把它放跑了。
When they found out that the mouse had no tail, they let it go.
我问他们为什么，一个小学生回答：“老师叫我们打了老鼠交尾巴。
When I asked them why, one of the pupils replied, "The teacher told us to hit the mice to hand over our tails.
没有尾巴要它干什么。
What does he do without a tail?
”可见，老师还没有把“除四害”的道理跟学生们讲明白。
"Obviously, the teacher has not explained the" four evils "to the students.
相比苍蝇、蚊子，麻雀个头大，最易发现、好对付，成为人们争相捕杀的对象，“连戴着一千二百多度眼镜的知识分子都拿着竹竿爬上了房顶轰赶麻雀”。
The sparrows are bigger than flies, mosquitoes, and are easier to spot and deal with. "Even intellectuals with more than 1,200 glasses climb up the roof with bamboo poles to drive away sparrows.
据不完全统计，1958年全国共扑杀麻雀2.1亿余只，苍蝇、蚊子等战果皆以吨计。
According to incomplete statistics, more than 210 million sparrows were eliminated in China in 1958, with tons of flies, mosquitoes and other fruits.
叶圣陶在1958年4月的一篇日记中记载：晨间四点过，围剿麻雀之役即开始。
Ye Shentao wrote in a diary in April 1958 that the battle against the sparrow began at four o'clock in the morning.
对门空军机关高楼上，扩音器中有人发号令。
There was a call from the loudspeaker on the upper floor of the Air Force building.
各家或敲盆桶，或放爆竹，或大声叫喊，务使麻雀不获停息，倦飞下坠。
Every house knocked on a pail, set off firecrackers, or shouted to make sure that the sparrow did not stop, burnout.
房顶上皆有人执长竿，竿端系红布或他色布，时时拂动……北京的灭雀之战，那叫惨烈：四处逃窜的麻雀无枝可依，精疲力尽，一只只小精灵跌落在地，气绝而死。
On the roof there are long pole, pole end red cloth or other color cloth, always flick... Beijing's war of sparrows, that is called fierce: fleeing sparrows no branches, exhausted, a little elves fell to the ground, breathless death.
[1]《北京晚报》还曾发表了郭沫若所作的“咒麻雀”诗一首：“……你真是个混蛋鸟，五气俱全到处跳。
& # 91; & # 39; & # 39; & # 39; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot;
犯下罪恶几千年，今天和你总清算……”想来这才是如今“抗疫诗”的鼻祖。
Sin for thousands of years, today and your total liquidation...... "Presumably this is now the" anti-epidemic poetry "ancestor.
1959年春，上海等大城市的林木相继出现严重虫灾，生态遭到破坏。
In the spring of 1959, forests in major cities such as Shanghai suffered serious insect infestation and ecological destruction.
11月，中国科学院党组书记张劲夫递交《关于麻雀问题向主席的报告》，对麻雀是益鸟还是害鸟进行了具体分析。
In November, the party secretary of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhang Jingfu, presented a report to the chairman on the sparrow issue, giving a detailed analysis of whether the sparrow was a beneficial or harmful bird.
次年3月，毛泽东在讲话中说：“麻雀不要打了，代之以臭虫，口号是‘除掉老鼠、臭虫、苍蝇、蚊子’。
In March of the following year, Mao Zedong said in his speech, "Sparrows should stop fighting and replace them with bedbugs, with the slogan 'Eliminate rats, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes'.
”捕杀麻雀的错误得以纠正。
The mistake of killing the sparrow was corrected.
2009年发布的《病媒生物预防控制管理规定》已将“四害”称为“病媒生物”，包括：蚊、蝇、蟑螂、鼠，以及“其他”，且将确定“其他”病媒的权限下放到各省。
The Regulation on the Prevention and Control of Vector Organisms, issued in 2009, already calls the "four hazards" "vector organisms," including mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, rodents, and "others," and has delegated the authority to identify "other" vectors to the provinces.
如今很多地方在爱卫运动的宣传文件中依然沿用 “四害”这一说法，成为抹不掉的时代印记。
Nowadays, many places still use the word "four harms" in the propaganda documents of the love-health movement, which has become the imprint of the times.
02.除了“除四害”这类影响深远的运动，如今人们生活中已养成的种种卫生习惯，也是群众性卫生运动的产物，比如现在的网络流行语“多喝热水”：因为沸水有杀菌功效，政府出于预防疾病的考虑作为一项政治任务来抓，经年累月逐渐成为人们日常生活的一部分。
In addition to far-reaching campaigns such as the "Four Harms," the hygiene practices that people have developed today are the product of mass hygiene campaigns, such as the popular Internet phrase "Drink lots of hot water": because boiling water kills germs, governments use it as a political task to prevent disease and gradually become a part of everyday life.
新中国成立后，官方以宣传画和标语的形式大力宣传 “喝开水”“不喝生水”，提倡从娃娃抓起，“孩子们应当养成每天喝三次白开水的习惯”；多地官方编纂的《农村卫生院课本》也一致要求，“卫生员应当积极宣传喝开水的好处，带动群众养成喝开水的好习惯”。
After the founding of New China, officials made great efforts to publicize the concept of drinking boiled water in the form of posters and slogans, urging children to start drinking boiled water three times a day from the dolls.
[3]学校免费向学生们提供热水，计划经济时代工厂大院的开水房也是这一时期的产物；用来盛装热水的暖水瓶、保温杯成为流行单品，暖水瓶甚至作为单项指标进行产量统计；“骑着倍儿新的自行车，带着彩花的暖水瓶”成为新人们迎接幸福生活的标志。
The hot water provided to students free of charge at school was a product of the period covered by the planned-economy-era factory compound; the thermos and thermos used to hold hot water became a popular item, and thermos bottles were even counted as a single indicator; "The new bicycle with its colorful thermos" was a sign of happiness for the new arrivals.
卫生运动的政治色彩未减，个体健康与国家治理之间的关联一直为管理者所重视。
The political aspect of the health movement has not diminished and the relationship between individual health and national governance has always been valued by managers.
1917年，24岁的毛泽东就以“二十八画生”为笔名，在《新青年》杂志上发表《体育之研究》，提出“欲文明其精神，先自野蛮其体魄”；民国时期，蒋介石发起以教育国民为目的的“新生活运动”，起草《新生活须知（95条）》中分为“规矩”和“清洁”两大项，例如“水不沸不喝”即包含于清洁一项中。
In 1917, Mao Zedong, 24, published a study of sports under the pseudonym of "Twenty-eight Painted Students" in the magazine New Youth, suggesting that "the spirit of civilization begins with barbarity." In the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Campaign to educate citizens.
1960年，“以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱”的著名口号一出，爱国卫生运动进入以搞好个人卫生和公共卫生为主题的时代。
In 1960, the patriotic public health movement entered an era of good hygiene and public health under the famous slogan, "Sanitary is the glory, Inhygiene is the disgrace."
路遥在《平凡的世界》里描述了七八十年代的爱国卫生运动：所有的机关和学校，所有的干部、学生、工人、市民，都根据“第六十九号”文件精神，开展爱国卫生运动。
In "Ordinary World," Luyao describes the patriotic health movement in the 1970s and 1980s: all government organs and schools, all cadres, students, workers and citizens, have carried out patriotic public health campaigns in accordance with the spirit of the "Sixty-ninth" document.
到处都在大扫除，擦门窗，拔杂草，油漆牌匾。
Cleaning is going on everywhere, cleaning doors and windows, pulling weeds, painting plaques.
城市上空黄尘笼罩，就像进行一场战争。
Dust hung over the city like a war.
我们现在依然熟悉的那些宣传标语：不乱丢果皮纸屑，生吃瓜果要洗净，勤洗手勤剪指甲，以及“门前三包”“五讲四美”这些记忆里的“专有名词”，其实都是爱国卫生运动的产物。
We are still familiar with the propaganda slogans: do not litter pulp, eat melon and fruit raw to wash hands, frequent nail clippings, "the first three bags" and "five words four beautiful," the memory of the "name," are in fact the product of the patriotic health movement.
另外，此次疫情中采取的“中西医结合”疗法也是建国初期爱国卫生运动确立的三大原则之一：全国卫生防疾工作遵循“面向工农兵，预防为主，团结中西医”三个原则，以危害人民健康最大的20种传染病为防治目标。
In addition, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is one of the three principles established by the patriotic public health movement in the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
（后来又加上第四个原则“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”）最近卖到脱销的84消毒液，即为防止传染病而研发。
(A fourth principle, "Combination of health work and mass movement," was recently sold out of stock as disinfectant 84, developed to prevent infectious diseases.
1983年上海暴发甲肝，引起群众恐慌，民众迫切需要一种能够居家使用的消毒杀菌产品。
The outbreak of hepatitis A in Shanghai in 1983 caused panic among the public, who urgently needed a disinfectant product that could be used at home.
1984年，地坛医院（当时叫北京第一传染病医院）研制出能迅速杀灭各类肝炎病毒的消毒液，即以年份命名为“84”肝炎洗消液，后更名为“84消毒液”。
In 1984, Ditan Hospital, then known as the Beijing No.1 Infectious Disease Hospital, developed a disinfectant that quickly killed all types of hepatitis viruses, known as "hepatitis 84" lotion, later renamed "disinfectant 84."
另一个值得一提的物品是肥皂。
Another item worth mentioning is soap.
除菌香皂品牌舒肤佳或许是这场运动的巨大受益者——1992年进入中国市场、主打除菌功效的舒肤佳，很快超过之前市场占有率第一的力士香皂，正是因为除菌概念迎合了市场需求，并拉上“中国医学会”作为科学后盾，成为品牌营销史上的经典案例。
Shu Skin Jia, the antibacterial soap brand, may have been a huge beneficiary of the movement - it was introduced into the Chinese market in 1992 and soon outperformed Rishi Saponin, the market leader, in 1992, precisely because the concept of sterilization caters to market demand and draws on the "Chinese Medical Association" as scientific backing to become a classic case in the history of brand marketing.
追溯当年这场运动的源头，1951年9月，毛泽东看了卫生部上报的《二十一个月来全国防疫工作的综合报告》，这是建国后毛泽东关于卫生工作批注的第一份文件，也成为日后爱国卫生运动的思想基础[5]：“必须教育干部，使他们懂得，就现状来说，每年全国人民因为缺乏卫生知识和卫生工作，引起疾病和死亡所受人力物力和经济上的损失，可能超过各项灾荒所受损失，绝不应轻视卫生工作。
In September 1951, Mao Zedong read the Ministry of Health's Comprehensive Report on National Immunization in the Twenty-First Month. This was Mao Zedong's first document on health care since the founding of the People's Republic.
