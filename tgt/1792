Chen Weiqiang Ren Shao Min 19 morning, Guandong Street Clean Water Community Grid, a community grid worker, conducted a house-to-door inspection at the Cartier residence in the district.
“我们小区终于排查了！”这两天，武汉网友们在微博、微信朋友圈里说得最多的就是这句话。
"Our community has finally checked out!" These two days, Wuhan netizens in Weibo, micro-letter in the circle of friends said the most is this sentence.
2月19日是武汉连续三日拉网清底大排查提交答卷的日子。
February 19 is Wuhan three consecutive days to draw up a large inventory of responses to the day.
第一财经记者多路采访了解到，受访的武汉市民这3天陆续接到了排查电话，微博平台上有关新冠肺炎患者的求助信息也清零了。
The first financial reporter multi-way interview learned that Wuhan city residents interviewed in the past three days have been receiving a line-up phone, Weibo platform about patients with pneumonia on the help of the clean.
武汉，正在起变化。
Wuhan is changing.
建台账清零“六类”人员2月16日，武汉市发布紧急通知，要求全市开展“全覆盖、拉网式”大排查，按照“不漏一户、不掉一人”的要求，详细登记每户村（居）民排查信息，建立台账资料。
The city of Wuhan issued an emergency notice on Feb. 16, asking the whole city to carry out a "full coverage, pull-out" sweep, in accordance with the "no leak, no one drop" requirements, detailed registration of each village (resident) screening information, set up a desktop account information.
通知要求，对排查中发现的确诊病例、临床诊断、疑似病例、确诊密接者、发热病人、CT检查肺部感染的（“六类”人员），立即向街镇指挥部报告，安排专车送诊或集中隔离，“2月19日以内，必须保证以上人员全部收治到位，实现清零”。

武汉市新洲区邾城街道龙城社区是一座颇具当地特色的社区，拥有2000余户、上万名居民。
The Longcheng community is a local community with more than 2,000 families and tens of thousands of residents.
由于社区呈现开放式布局，部分小区已经毗邻城区繁华的文昌大道、新洲大街，整个社区共有26个出入口，在当前疫情防控的严格要求下，管理难度较大。
Due to the open layout of the community, some small areas have been adjacent to the busy downtown Wenchang Avenue, Xinzhou Street, a total of 26 community access, under the current strict requirements of disease prevention and control, more difficult to manage.
目前，龙城社区已封闭了大部分的出入口，仅保留7个供居民正常外出采购物资以及消防需要等使用。
At present, the Longcheng community has closed most of the entrances and exits, leaving only seven for residents to purchase supplies and fire-fighting needs.
龙城社区副书记余欢对第一财经记者介绍，截至18日晚上8时许，在8名社区工作人员和3名志愿者的努力下，当天社区一共排查了1530户居民，均未发现有上级要求的“六类”人员。
As of 8 pm on the 18th, through the efforts of eight community workers and three volunteers, a total of 1,530 households had been checked by the community, none of whom had been identified as "six" by their superiors, said Yu Huan, deputy secretary of the Longcheng community.
此前，该社区对“四类人员”已经实施了细致清理。
The community had previously carried out a detailed purge of "four categories of people."
就在几天前，龙城社区已将最后一批隔离的人员送至当地在学校设置的隔离点。
Just a few days ago, the Longcheng community had taken the last group of isolated people to separate sites set up by the local schools.
余欢说，19日还要将全部余下的住户家排查完，“有的是楼梯房，需要一层层爬，工作人员入户排查回来之后，大冬天里汗流浃背。
Yu Huan said that the remaining households will be on the 19th, "some staircase rooms, need to climb, staff back home after the sweaty winter.
”18日晚间，家住江汉区新华路附近的刘女士求助第一财经记者，她的父亲80多岁，在福利院感染确诊新冠肺炎，生命危急，医院和社区“让我们等”，一直没有何时能住院的消息”，家人焦急万分。
"In the evening of the 18th, Ms. Liu, who lives near Xinhua Road in the Jianghan District, turned to the First Financial Reporter. Her father, in his 80s, contracted SARS and was in a critical condition.
19日，刘女士告诉记者，救护车已经将父亲送往定点医院救治。
On the 19th, Ms. Liu told reporters that the ambulance had sent his father to a designated hospital for treatment.
“这次是真的应收尽收，不漏一人了”，刘女士感慨。
"This is a real receivable, do not leak a person," Ms. Liu sigh.
在18日武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部视频例会上，湖北省委常委、武汉市委书记王忠林表示，要在严厉排查上持续加力，摸清底数，把握疫情防控主动权，若未兑现承诺将严肃追责问责；加大组织力度，尽快调配力量，确保20日前完成临床确诊病例、疑似患者、密切接触者、发热病人核酸检测。
Hubei Provincial Standing Committee and Wuhan Communist Party Secretary Wang Zhonglin said at a regular video meeting on the 18th, Hubei provincial Communist Party Standing Committee, Wuhan party secretary Wang Zhonglin, said that in strict screening, we should continue to strengthen efforts, understand the bottom, grasp the epidemic prevention and control initiative, if not serious accountability; strengthen the organization, as soon as possible, to ensure clinical confirmed cases, suspected patients, close contacts, fever patients nucleic acid testing.
要在应收尽收上持续加力，确保居家确诊患者全部收治，把在集中隔离点的确诊患者分类转移到定点医院和方舱医院；对于拒绝被收治的病人，要依法依规进行处理。
Continuous efforts should be made to ensure that all patients diagnosed at home are admitted, that patients identified in centralized isolation points are classified and transferred to designated and square-cabin hospitals, and that patients who are refused treatment are treated in accordance with the law.
排查100%见面率要求有挑战上述通知还要求，通过送物资、查体温、发卡片等多种方式进行全员排查，原则上不能以微信、电话报平安的方式排查，确保见面率100%。
Checking 100% Meeting Requirement Challenges The notice also requires that all personnel be screened through a variety of means, including delivery of supplies, body temperature checks, card issuance, etc., and in principle cannot be checked by e-mail or telephone message to ensure a meeting rate of 100%.
第一财经记者采访发现，三天的拉网式排查基本做到了“不漏一户、不掉一人”，但要求100%见面率的规定值得商榷。
The first financial reporter found that the three-day screening basically achieved "do not leak a house, do not drop a person," but the requirements of 100% meeting rate is questionable.
家住武昌积玉桥街道的唐先生反映，18日有工作人员在全小区逐一敲门，询问是否有人在家、是否有发热人员，没有入户检查。
Mr. Tang, who lives on the Jade Bridge in Wuchang, said staff knocked at the door one by one on the 18 th, asking if anyone was at home, had feverish people and did not enter the house to check.
唐先生表示，这是疫情发生以来第一次有人敲门排查，此前并没有接到询问。
Mr. Tang said it was the first time someone had knocked on the door since the outbreak and had not been questioned before.
在上一轮全面健康普查时，家住武汉东湖高新区关东街道的周先生表示，并没有工作人员询问自己家健康情况。
At the time of the last comprehensive health survey, Mr. Zhou, who lives in Guandong Street, a high-tech district of Donghu, Wuhan, said no one asked about his family's health.
但他19日早上告诉第一财经记者，昨天和前天都接到了人工智能语音电话，询问自己家人健康情况。
But he told the first financial reporter on the morning of the 19th, yesterday and the day before yesterday received artificial intelligence voice telephone, asked his family health.
东湖高新区利用人工智能语音随访系统等科技手段，由人工智能机器人普查发热病人，询问居民家庭人数、有无发热等状况、有无新冠肺炎接触史等问题，并将回答记录并自动生成表格反馈给社区工作者。
Using the artificial intelligence voice follow-up system and other technology, the high-tech area of the East Lake will survey the febrile patients by the artificial intelligence robot, ask about the number of families, whether there is any fever, whether there is contact history of the new crown pneumonia, and automatically generate the form to feed back to the community workers.
据了解，该系统可同时拨打900个居民电话，6小时可查20万户居民。
It is understood that the system can make up to 900 residential calls at the same time and that 200,000 households can be reached in six hours.
无接触排查效率虽然较纯人工更高，但不能排除会有漏网之鱼。
Although the non-contact inspection efficiency is higher than the pure artificial, but can not exclude that there will be fish leakage.
为此，不少社区采用了多种方式相配合的模式摸排。
To this end, many communities have adopted a variety of ways to match the model mapping.
洪山区张家湾街道张家湾社区副书记徐秋思对第一财经记者表示，自己分管的两个小区共有1.2万户居民，是洪山区最大的小区。
Xu Qiuxi, deputy secretary of the Zhangjiawan community in Hong Kong's Zhangjiawan district, told the first financial reporter that his two sub-districts, with 12,000 residents, were the largest in Hong Kong's mountainous region.
此次为期三天的拉网排查，该社区开展了4种方式配合的摸排，即微信（小程序、18个微信群）、AI电话语音系统、工作人员电话询问三种无接触式排查，加上驻点楼栋的志愿者和社区工作人员针对性地入户摸排，来完成全部的拉网排查工作。
During the three-day screening, the community conducted four collaborative mapping exercises, namely micromail (mini-programs, 18 micro-groups), AI telephone voice systems, three non-contact voice checks by staff, and targeted house-to-house mapping of volunteers and community workers in the building to complete the full screening process.
“3天时间内完全挨家挨户上门排查是不可能的，只能采用线上线下结合的方式反复摸排，来尽量确保无缺漏。
"Door-to-door searches over a three-day period are impossible and can only be done through on-line and off-line combinations to ensure as much as possible.
”徐秋思坦言。
Xu Qiusis confessed.
她透露，经过两天多时间的排查，该社区18日查到一名发热居民，联系送诊后，确认是支气管炎引发的症状，得以排除；19日又查到一名一岁半的幼童身体不适，家人反映是呛咳反应，但仍需接受进一步的医学排查。
She revealed that after more than two days of screening, the community 18 found a feverish resident, contact after consultation, confirmed that bronchitis caused symptoms, was eliminated; 19 and a half-year-old child was found sick, the family reported a cough response, but still need to undergo further medical screening.
社区基层人少事多亟需增援“从春节前到现在，我们一天都没有休息，每天从早到晚要工作10多个小时。
"We haven't had a day off since the Spring Festival, and we've been working more than 10 hours a day from morning till night.
”龙城社区副书记余欢对第一财经记者说，该社区仅有10名工作人员，却要对全社区1万多名居民服务，虽然上级机关有干部下基层到社区，并且还有志愿者帮忙，但人手仍颇为紧缺。
The community, with just 10 employees, serves more than 10,000 residents of the community, and is in dire need of staff even though there are cadres at the grass-roots level to the community and volunteers to help, Yu Huan, deputy secretary of Longcheng Community, told the first financial reporter.
社区防护物资亦十分紧缺。
Community protection materials are also in short supply.
第一财经记者看到，龙城社区的工作人员戴着普通居家清洗使用的塑料胶皮手套以及塑料一次性手套，有的甚至只能披件雨衣当防护服。
The first financial reporter saw the Longcheng community wearing ordinary household cleaning plastic rubber gloves and disposable plastic gloves, some can only wear a raincoat as a protective clothing.
清水源社区书记刘声贵亦对第一财经表示，武汉实行分诊制度后，社区是预诊和分诊的第一道防线，为守好这道防线，巨量的社区工作如潮水般涌来。
Liu Xianggui, the secretary of the Qingshui Community, also told First Finance that the district was the first line of defense for pre-diagnosis and referral after Wuhan implemented the separation system.
刘声贵说，除了大量排查工作外，我们每天还要监督物业进行消杀工作；组织物业和业委会团购物资，保障居民基本生活需求；帮助有困难的老人送饭送药；封闭式管理时间一久，还要安抚居民情绪，稳控社区秩序，“人少事多，每天都是千头万绪”。
In addition to a large number of checks, we have to supervise the destruction of properties every day, organize property and industry committees to purchase goods to meet the basic needs of the residents, help elderly people in difficulty to deliver food and medicines, and calm residents and maintain order in the community over a long period of time.
武汉疫情防控工作到了最后的窗口期，也是最吃紧的关键阶段。
Wuhan epidemic prevention and control work to the last window, is also the most tight critical stage.
为遏制疫情扩散蔓延，增援社区力量，湖北省委常委、武汉市委书记王忠林要求，下派到社区的干部要服从社区管理，参与社区工作，积极发动群众；各区要在发动群众上持续加力，让居民参与到社区防控工作之中，只有居民都参与进来了，才能真正把小区当成自己的家园。
In order to stop the spread of the epidemic and strengthen community forces, the Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Wuhan Party Secretary Wang Zhonglin requested that cadres assigned to the communities be subject to community management, participate in community work and actively mobilize the masses.
