今天是情人节。
Today is Valentine's Day.
而不久之前，身份都是医生的陈政博、辛奇遥，选择先在家人微信群中举行了特别的视频婚礼。
Not long ago, the identity of the doctors Chen Zhenbao, Xinqiyao, chose to hold a special video wedding in the family micro-letter group.
这对战疫一线的新人终成眷属，陈政博说，待疫情结束，春暖花开，他会给妻子再补上一场最浪漫的婚礼。
When the outbreak is over and the spring is over, Chen Zhenbao said, he will give his wife to make up for the most romantic wedding.
口述|陈政博整理 |应　琛如果没有春节前这场突如其来的疫情，我现在应该刚和妻子度完蜜月回来。
Chen Zhengbo: If it hadn't been for the sudden outbreak before the Spring Festival, I should have returned from my honeymoon with my wife.
但现在非但蜜月没去成，我们原定在2月2日举行的婚礼也取消了。
But instead of going on our honeymoon, our wedding scheduled for February 2 was canceled.
但这是我们一起做的决定，婚礼的意义就是希望大家见证幸福，如果亲友带着担心到来，那婚礼也就失去了原本的意义。
But this is the decision we made together, the meaning of the wedding is to see you happy, if relatives and friends come with fear, then the wedding will lose its original meaning.
我和妻子是大学同学。
My wife and I are college classmates.
毕业后，我俩都留在上海。
After graduation, both of us stayed in Shanghai.
我现在在天山中医医院内科工作，妻子则是在徐汇区一家社区医院当全科医生。
I am working in Tian Shan TCM Hospital, and my wife is a general practitioner in a community hospital in Xuhui District.
恋爱多年后，我们在上海买了房，终于在去年8月领了结婚证。
After years of love, we bought a house in Shanghai and finally got our marriage certificate last August.
从那个时候开始，两家人也就积极筹备起婚礼来。
From that time on, the two families were actively preparing for the wedding.
陈政博和妻子辛奇遥研究生毕业时的合影因为都是学医的，所以当时相关消息一出来的时候，我俩就有所警惕了。
Chen Zhenbao and his wife Sinchyao graduate students graduated because they are all medical students, so when the relevant news came out, we were on guard.
但因为我家情况比较特殊，我父亲是温州人，我母亲是内蒙古人，他们又长期在新疆做生意。
But my father is from Wenzhou and my mother is from Inner Mongolia. They do business in Xinjiang for a long time.
而我妻子家是山西人。
My wife's family is from Shanxi.
等于双方的亲朋好友从全国各地到上海，要把人凑齐不容易，所以很早我们就发出了邀请。
My family and friends from both sides came to Shanghai from all over the country. It was not easy to get people together, so we made an invitation early.
虽然过程中也有一些亲友提出过担忧或是打电话来询问还办不办，一直到1月10日左右，我们都还告知他们会如期举行。
Although some of our friends and relatives raised concerns or called to ask if there was anything we could do until around January 10, we told them they would meet the deadline.
但随着疫情的发展，我开始觉得取消婚礼是很有必要的，就怀着忐忑的心情和妻子透露了自己的想法。
But as the epidemic unfolded, I began to feel the need to cancel the wedding, with a perturbed mood and his wife revealed their thoughts.
毕竟，这次婚礼是我们期待了很久的。
After all, this wedding is something we've been looking forward to for a long time.
我还设想了很多理由来说服她。
And I figured out a lot of reasons to convince her.
没想到，还没等我开口，妻子就表达了同样的想法。
Unexpectedly, my wife expressed the same idea before I could speak.
我们都觉得，应该要响应国家的号召，尤其身为医生，这个时候强行举办婚礼，是一种不负责任的表现。
We all felt that it was time to respond to the call of the State, especially as doctors, and that it would be irresponsible to force a wedding at this time.
既然和妻子达成了一致，接下来就是说服双方的父母。
Now that agreement has been reached with the wife, the next step is to persuade both parents.
1月19日，我们的父母各自从外地来到了上海，原来是想最后再合计一下婚礼的相关事宜。
On January 19th, our parents came to Shanghai from other places, hoping to make a final calculation about the wedding.
但第二天，我们却告诉他们要取消婚礼。
But the next day, we told them to cancel the wedding.
他们当时是有些顾虑的，毕竟已经花了不少钱，婚礼取消的话不知道造成多少损失，再有亲戚朋友都已经定了机票和酒店。
After all, they had already spent a lot of money. If the wedding was cancelled, I don't know how much damage it would cause.
但最终，在我和妻子的坚持下，我俩也给他们看了一些相关报道，科普了这个冠状病毒的危害性。
But in the end, at my wife's insistence, we also showed them some reports of the coronavirus's harmfulness.
双方父母最终还是同意了。
The parents agreed in the end.
我父亲还主动承担下通知亲友的“任务”，亲朋都是比较理解的。
My father also took the initiative to inform relatives and friends of the "task," relatives and friends are relatively understanding.
好在后面相关的政策都出了，机酒这些都可以全额退还。
Fortunately, the later related policies are out, the machine and alcohol can be returned in full.
我们也就心安了，没让他们承担什么损失。
We were relieved not to let them take any losses.
决定取消婚礼后，陈政博发了一条朋友圈想到医院可能缺人手，我主动打电话给领导，告诉他们我可以回来继续上班，顺便也把婚假取消了。
After the decision to cancel the wedding, Chen Zhenbo a circle of friends thought the hospital might be short of staff, I volunteered to call the leadership, told them I can go back to work, and also cancelled the wedding leave.
我妻子亦是如此。
So does my wife.
但说实话，我俩心里还是有些许遗憾。
But to tell you the truth, there's a little pity in our hearts.
某天我俩坐在沙发上看电视，一算2月2日，我俩都是休息。
The other day we were sitting on the couch watching TV. On February 2, we were both resting.
也记不清是谁先起的头，就说要不还是搞个小小的仪式吧，也算是我们正式结婚了。
I can't remember who got up first, but I think it's time for a little ceremony. We're officially married.
2月2日那天，我们便在家人微信群中举行了一场特别的视频婚礼。
On February 2, we had a special video wedding in the family microphone group.
因为微信只支持9人的在线视频。
Because the tweets only support online videos of nine people.
当时，出席名单也商议了好久。
At that time, attendance lists were also negotiated for a long time.
因为婚礼取消，我父母后来是回了温州老家过年。
Because the wedding was canceled, my parents went back to Wenzhou hometown for the New Year.
她父母在上海和我们一起过年。
Her parents spent the New Year with us in Shanghai.
所以，我父母占了一个，还有就是我的叔叔一家，她的表哥，还有我们的朋友等等。
So, my parents have one, my uncles, her cousins, our friends, and so on.
视频婚礼“从今以后，无论安乐困苦，富足贫穷，有病无病，我都爱护你，尊重你，直到终身”，我俩宣读了婚礼誓词，紧紧抱在了一起。
Video Wedding "From now on, I will love and honor you, no matter whether you are happy or poor, rich or poor, sick or ill." We read the wedding vows and held them together.
而视频那头响起了掌声，久久未息。
But the video end sounded applause, long time did not interest.
家里亲戚送来的祝福后来，我所在医院成了发热门诊的指定医院，发了通知希望我们相关科室的医生可以去支援发热门诊，我也主动请缨。
Later, my hospital became a designated hospital for fever clinics, issued a notice to the doctors in our relevant departments to support the fever clinic, I also volunteered to volunteer.
2月11日，是我第一个在发热门诊的白班，从8点到20点。
Feb. 11, it was my first day shift at the fever clinic, from 8 to 20.
第一次穿着全套防护服，戴上口罩和护目镜给病人看病，这才感受到了新闻中报道的那种难受。
The first time I saw a patient in a full set of protective clothing, masks and goggles, I felt the discomfort reported in the news.
因为防护服很密闭，不透风，我能明显感到汗在往下淌，而戴着口罩不仅很勒，说话都很费劲。
Because the suits were airtight and airtight, I could clearly feel sweat dripping down, and wearing a mask was not only strangely painful, it was very difficult to speak.
更重要的是，为了减少物资损耗，12小时里我和同事都没喝水，没上过厕所。
More importantly, to reduce material losses, neither my colleagues nor I drank water or used the toilet for 12 hours.
那一天，我大概看了二三十个病人，基本上都是普通感冒。
On that day, I had probably seen twenty or thirty patients, mostly common colds.
但我能明显感受到他们普遍的焦虑和紧张。
But I could clearly feel their general anxiety and nervousness.
我不仅要看他们身体上的疾病，更多的还要疏解他们心理的不安。
I have to see not only their physical illness, but also their psychological uneasiness.
陈政博在工作中有两个病人，我印象特别深。
Chen Zhenbao has two patients at work, and I am particularly impressed.
一个是年轻的外卖小哥，他完全没有症状，以至于我连医嘱都不知道怎么写。
One was a young takeaway brother who was so asymptomatic that I didn't know how to write a doctor's order.
来看病，只因为听说他住的隔壁小区有一例新冠肺炎确诊，想来排除一下。
To see a doctor, only to hear that he lives in the neighborhood of a diagnosis of pneumonia, would like to exclude.
关键是他都没有去过那里。
The point is he hasn't even been there.
我给他普及了一下相关知识后，小哥还算比较能接受，走的时候也松了一口气。
I gave him a general knowledge of the relevant, the younger brother is still relatively acceptable, leaving a sigh of relief.
还有一个是60多岁的阿姨，也是没什么症状，血检后指标也都很正常。
There is also an aunt in her sixties, is also no symptoms, blood test indicators are normal.
但她偏偏不信，强烈要求要拍CT和做核酸检测。
But she was incredulous, urging CT and nucleic acid testing.
我跟她说做这些检查都是要有标准的。
I told her that these tests had to be standard.
阿姨一听，原本没有的症状都有了，说她头晕，乏力，还咳嗽……其实，我想说，我们每个人只要做好了基本的防护，少外出，在家勤洗手。
Auntie listened to the original symptoms are not, said she dizziness, fatigue, coughing... In fact, I would like to say that we all as long as the basic protection, less out, wash hands at home.
上海还是很安全的，没有必要过分焦虑和担心。
Shanghai is still very safe, there is no need to be overly anxious and worried.
身体和精神的双重压力下，记得当天下了班，我直接就打了车回到家，倒头就睡了。
Under the pressure of both body and spirit, remember when the world of work, I took a taxi directly home, fell asleep.
我现在比较担心的是我父母。
I'm more worried about my parents right now.
大家都知道，温州目前也是疫情重点地区。
As we all know, Wenzhou is also the epicenter of the epidemic.
听说他们住的小区里就有了确诊病例。
I heard they had a confirmed case in their neighborhood.
现在每天我都会和他们通电话了解情况。
Now I talk to them by phone every day.
好在他们身心各方面都还不错，能做到尽量不出门。
Fortunately, they are good in all aspects of the body and mind, can do as far as possible not to go out.
而我妻子在春节期间也去了上海南站支援，在那种人员密集场所，尤其是返沪人员比较多的地方，说实话我真的很舍不得。
And my wife also went to Shanghai South Station during the Spring Festival to support, in that kind of densely populated places, especially in Shanghai more people, to tell the truth, I really hate.
“穿好防护服，再难受也不能摘下口罩！”“有空了就多喝点水，勤洗手！”……每天出门上班前，我们俩对彼此的这些“碎碎念”瞬间就成了最动听的语言。
"Wear protective clothing, no pain can not take off the mask!" "When free, drink more water, frequent hand-washing!..".. each day before going to work, the two of us to each other's "broken thoughts" become the most beautiful language.
武汉加油！尽管很累，但疫情形势严峻，治病救人是医生的天职，我们责无旁贷。
Wuhan refueling! Although very tired, but the situation is serious, it is the doctor's vocation to treat and save people, we are duty-bound.
而我能和最爱的人一起并肩阻击疫情，也特别有意义。
And it is particularly meaningful that I can stand shoulder to shoulder with my loved ones in the fight against the epidemic.
等到疫情结束，春暖花开，我一定会给妻子一场最浪漫的婚礼。
When the epidemic is over and spring blossoms, I will surely give my wife a most romantic wedding.
