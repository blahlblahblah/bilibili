燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳一场疫情，逼着全国人民都学会做凉皮了。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former founder and editor of Jinzhou Fan has had an epidemic that has forced people all over the country to learn how to make cool skin.
事情还要从外卖不让进小区说起，大家在疫情期间都学会算经济账了：取一次外卖，要消耗口罩一个、一次性手套一个，还要把手、头发、外套都洗一遍，为了保证绝对安全，不如在家做饭。
Let's start with take-out and keep it out of the neighborhood. We've all learned to take out a takeaway, use a mask, a disposable glove, and wash your hands, hair and coat all over the place. To be absolutely safe, cook at home.
微博话题“宅在家美食才艺大比拼”热度情况来源 / 微博一时间，一场名为“宅在家美食才艺大比拼”的自发性赛事，从短视频平台、食谱类APP转战到朋友圈、微博，全网的美食达人们比拼的项目从凉皮到油条，最新的宠儿是电饭煲蛋糕。

只知道不少人选择在家办公之余开始研究厨艺，没想到，部分选手已经在挑战hard模式了。
Just know a lot of people choose to work at home after the study of cooking, did not expect, some players are already challenging hard mode.
疫情之下，第一个受到巨大影响的行业，就是餐饮业，一夜之间全国餐厅几乎全部歇业，部分地区甚至出台了禁止所有餐饮店铺营业的紧急通知。
The first industry to be hit hard by the epidemic was the catering industry, where restaurants were almost completely shut down overnight, and in some areas emergency orders were issued prohibiting all catering establishments from operating.
虽然非常时期不少餐饮企业强化了外卖业务，但多数小区外卖禁入，全民响应“少出门”，加之少部分人对外卖食品安全的担忧，在家做饭似乎成了解决吃饭问题的单一路径。
While many restaurants have stepped up take-out business during the hard times, most take-out areas are off limits, people are responding with "less going out," and a small number of people worry about food safety, cooking at home seems to be the only solution to the problem.
“疫情期间，绝大多数人拥有了更多时间，养成了在家做饭的习惯。
"During the epidemic, the vast majority of people had more time and formed the habit of cooking at home.
”不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷评论，生鲜买菜成为刚需，这个赛道上的很多公司迎来井喷期，甚至中石化也在加油站开启了卖菜模式，另外方便类、速食类、半成品菜和成品菜都是暴涨的行情。
Li Zhu-jie, founder partner of Confused Venture, said: 'Fresh food is just what is needed. Many companies on the track are experiencing a boom, and Sinopec has even started selling vegetables at its gas stations, while convenience, fast-food, semi-finished and finished vegetables are soaring.
“全民厨子”背后，除“抢菜大战”给生鲜电商带来突击大考之外，还产生了一系列连锁反应：食谱类APP在移动应用中涨幅排名靠前，部分APP流量翻番，方便类食品成交额增长3.5倍、速冻品同比增长241%，调味品、半成品在京东上销量分别上涨129%和142%，连锁餐饮品牌为了自救转战线上卖起了半成品食材，还有创业者将智能烹饪机从韩国搬到国内……这些现象背后到底有哪些是真正的机会，又有哪些只是短暂的“应激反应”？食谱类APP流量激增留存用户还得拼产品“原来最多煮个泡面，现在被逼得在APP上学做饭，目前已经开始明目张胆在朋友圈晒厨艺了，甚至幻想出个自研食谱。
"Behind the" national cook, "in addition to" fight for food "to bring fresh electric manufacturers, but also produced a series of chain reaction: APP in mobile applications, some APP traffic doubled, easy-to-cook food sales rose by a factor of 129% and 142%.
”在北京工作的程郁告诉燃财经，疫情当前，外卖平台上还提供服务的店铺屈指可数，他居住的社区管理趋严，家里口罩已经告急，在吃了几顿泡面后，痛定思痛，开始学习做饭。
Mr Cheng, who works in Beijing, tells Flaming Finance that the epidemic is at a time when few stores offer services on takeaway platforms, his community is more tightly managed and his masks are in crisis.
自己动手，丰衣足食，疫情期间，像程郁这样临时抱佛脚查食谱的人不在少数。
Hands-on, plenty of food and clothing, during the epidemic, such as Cheng Yu temporary cram recipes, many people.
燃财经查询七麦数据2020年1月移动应用增长榜发现，美食佳饮子分类前20名中，食谱类APP占4席。
Cookbook APP accounts for 4 of the top 20 food and beverage categories in the growth list of mobile applications for January 2020.
食谱分享平台“网上厨房”后台的数据显示，春节期间，三四线城市的新增用户有明显增长。
Data from the back of the online kitchen, a recipe-sharing platform, show a marked increase in new users in third and fourth-tier cities during the Spring Festival.
网上厨房CEO杨洋称，受疫情影响，与大量一线城市的务工人员滞留三四线城市有直接关系。
Yang Yang, CEO of the online kitchen, said the epidemic affected a large number of workers in the first-tier cities stay in the third and fourth line of the city.
美食社区“豆果美食”COO钟锋向燃财经介绍，在豆果美食的年夜饭大数据中，香菇鸡片、清蒸鲈鱼和蔓越莓发糕，是被做次数最多的三道菜，其中前两道都属于快手菜。
Mushroom chicken fillet, steamed bass and cranberry parfait are the three most-served dishes, the first two of which are fast food, according to Caifang Finance and Finance.
据钟锋总结，年轻一代不做饭的原因，除了工作忙，时间有限，更多的是从小在家都是爸爸妈妈做饭，自己不会做，这次疫情期间空余时间变多，很多人发现跟着食谱学做饭不是太难的事情，晒厨艺还满足了一部分年轻人的社交展示需求。
According to Zhong Feng, the reasons why the younger generation do not cook, in addition to the busy work, limited time, more parents are at home from childhood cooking, do not do it themselves, the epidemic period more spare time, many people find it not too difficult to learn cooking recipes, drying dishes also meet some of the social needs of young people.
家住温州的宋齐，就是俗称的朋友圈晒厨艺狂魔。
Home to Wenzhou Song Qi, is commonly known as the circle of friends bask in cooking fanatic.
“被迫宅在家第5天左右，我就开始打开食谱APP进修厨艺了，因为每天刷时间最长的还是疫情相关的新闻，需要转移注意力来调节心情，下厨真的很治愈，还能吃到想吃的东西。
"After being forced to stay at home for about five days, I started to open the cookbook APP, because the longest brush day is the news about the epidemic, the need to shift attention to mood management, the cook really cures, and I can eat what I want.
”关于朋友圈厨艺大比拼，宋齐的经验是，如果参赛，一定要挑战高难度的菜谱，互动率才会高。
"Song Qi's experience in competing in a circle of friends is that interaction is high when it comes to challenging difficult recipes.
宋齐的朋友圈来源 / 受访者提供借着这波红利，豆果美食从1月27日开始，将站内付费课程全部免费开放。
Song Qi's circle of friends / interviewees offered the bonus that starting January 27, all paid in-house courses will be free.
钟锋坦言，在疫情爆发的第一时间，团队紧急沟通，豆果美食无法像巨头一样拿出过亿的捐款，那就把所有课程全免，支持全民在家做饭。
In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, Mr. Zhong confessed, 'The team was in urgent communication, and if legumes can't be donated as big as a giant, then we'll dispense with all classes and support home cooking for all.
付费课程和电商，是豆果美食变现的两个主要方式，据了解，截至发稿，该站免费课程还没有恢复收费的安排。
Paid courses and electronic commerce are the two main ways to realize the fruits and vegetables, it is understood that, as of the date of distribution, the station free courses have not resumed the arrangement of fees.
豆果美食CEO王宇翔告诉燃财经，疫情期间全民闭门在家，确实对学做饭有一定的红利性，从疫情开始，平台的流量增长红利明显，流量涨幅已经翻番。
Fruit and Fruit CEO Wang Yuxiang told Flaming Finance, the epidemic period closed-door people at home, do learn to cook a certain dividend, from the outbreak, the platform's flow growth dividend is obvious, traffic growth has doubled.
关于新增用户，豆果美食后台的反馈是，新增用户与过往用户群类似，以23-45岁的女性为主；疫情的出现也让部分男性用户加入，江浙沪一带的男性用户增长率较高。
With regard to new users, the feedback from the legume background was that the new users were similar to previous user groups, mainly women aged 23-45; the emergence of the epidemic also led to the inclusion of some male users, with a higher rate of male user growth in Zhejiang and Shanghai.
这与网上厨房的后台数据比较吻合。
This is in line with the background data of the online kitchen.
1月24日至2月8日期间，网上厨房20.29%的新增用户是18-34岁间的三四线城市的女性用户；这期间APP活跃用户中，不管是iOS端还是Android端，均是广东用户占比遥遥领先，其次是浙江、江苏、上海、北京等地。
Between 24 January and 8 February, 20.29 per cent of new online kitchen users were women in the third and fourth-tier cities between the ages of 18 and 34; both iOS and Android users were the most active users in Guangdong, followed by Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Beijing.
那么疫情之后，这些用户能否留下，用户在家做饭的习惯还能延续多久呢？钟锋认为，这次疫情对于食谱类APP来说是个催化剂，不但让人们充分认识到了健康饮食的重要性，而且培养了一部分人在家做饭的习惯。
After the outbreak, whether these users can stay and how long the habit of cooking at home can last? Zhong said the outbreak was a catalyst for the cookbook APP, which not only made people fully aware of the importance of a healthy diet, but also fostered the habit of cooking at home.
从长期来看，钟锋认为外出吃饭和在家吃饭并不冲突，简单的餐可以自己做，复杂的菜肴可以出去吃，甚至可以到家再复刻。
In the long run, Mr. Zhong sees no conflict between eating out and eating at home. Simple meals can be cooked on one's own, complex dishes can be eaten out or even remade at home.
最近豆果站内热度最高的菜谱，凉皮、油条、红糖发糕，都属于复刻美食，而这样的复刻美食往往是全网响应。
Recently, the hottest menu in the fruit station, cold skin, sliced oil, brown sugar parfait, are all part of the gourmet complex, which is often a response to the entire network.
2月12日前后，电饭煲蛋糕在豆果站内的热度开始飙升。
Around February 12, the fervor of the rice cooker at the bean counter began to soar.
燃财经发现，时间点与微博上同一话题的热度趋势吻合。
Burning Finance found that the time point coincided with the trend of the same topic on Weibo.
微博话题“电饭煲蛋糕”热度情况来源 / 燃财经钟锋认为电饭煲蛋糕能火起来的背后原因和凉皮类似。
www.51education.net) www.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cnwww.youtheme.cn
“豆果站内南北方用户的占比是1:1，大年初四，技术同事反馈，凉皮的搜索热度居高不下，我们也很意外，查后台发现不仅北方用户在做，连南方用户也参与进来了。
"The ratio of users in the north to the south of the station was 1: 1. At the beginning of the year, feedback from technical colleagues, the high heat in the search for livers was surprising.
”据钟锋和同事们分析，当时大家春节囤的年货消耗得差不多了，所有人宅在家里需要打发时间，凉皮工序复杂，操作过程非常消磨时间，又对食材、工具要求不高，做出来还可以分享。
According to Zhong Feng and his colleagues, the New Year was a time-consuming one for everyone, with everyone spending time at home, a complex skin-cooling process, a very time-consuming process and low requirements for ingredients and tools, which can be shared.
宋齐就是在#朋友圈手工凉皮大赛#话题登上微博热搜后参赛的，用她的话说，做一份凉皮，至少要花一下午，最重要的是凉皮对物资要求极低，只要家有面粉就可以参赛，配菜也是丰俭由人。
In her words, it takes at least an afternoon to make a cool leather, and the most important thing is that the skin is very low in material requirements, as long as there is flour in the home, the food is rich and frugal.
程郁告诉燃财经，自己在疫情结束后可能会减少外食，因为现在发现在家做饭难度不大，而且省钱，“就像网上那个段子说的，这次疫情让很多公司老板发现，没有很多员工，也能活”。
Cheng told Caijing he might cut back on take-out after the outbreak, because he now finds it harder and cheaper to cook at home. "As the post-epidemic puts it on the Internet, many company bosses have found that without many employees, they can survive."
“疫情给了食谱软件免费获客的时间，但是同时也是考验各家产品的关键时刻。
"The epidemic is giving people free time to get recipes, but it's also a critical time to test their products.
”一位业内人士告诉燃财经，用户会比较，到底哪个产品更好用，只有足够好用，用户的使用习惯才会延续到疫情过后，用户才能真正留存下来。
One industry insider told Business that users would compare which product worked better and only if it worked well enough for users' habits to survive the epidemic.
杨洋就对燃财经表示，疫情对公司长期的发展没有影响，面对疫情期间这波机会，网上厨房的计划就是多引流拉新用户。
Yang said the outbreak had no impact on the company's long-term development, and in the face of this wave of opportunities during the epidemic, the plan for the online kitchen is to attract new users.
方便面速冻品被抢购但只有速冻品有翻身可能一场疫情，逼出了一批煮饭大军，也让不少人认清了自己的生存能力。
Instant-noodle freezers are snapped up but only quick-frozen products can turn over an epidemic, forcing out a army of cookers and making many people aware of their viability.
出于对自己厨艺的担忧，程郁在返京后，第一时间从到家平台上抢购了方便面、速冻水饺、火锅底料。
Worried about his cooking skills, Cheng Yu returned to Beijing, the first time from the home platform snapped up instant noodles, frozen dumplings, hot pot ingredients.
他说，为了减少出门的次数，首选能囤能放的物资。
In order to reduce the number of trips out, he said, hoarding is the preferred option.
用“抢购”这个字眼并不夸张，在疫情期间，“你家附近的超市里，哪个口味的方便面被剩下了？”的话题在社交媒体上刷屏。
It is no exaggeration to use the word "snap-up" when, during the epidemic, the topic "Which flavor of instant noodles is left in your local supermarket?" was brushed on social media.
当人们在讨论那些被剩下的方便面何错之有时，还有一些人根本没有选择的机会。
While people are talking about what's wrong with being left with instant noodles, others don't have a choice at all.
家门口就有超市、便利店的林朵在返工后就发现，不但便利店冷柜里的便当、饭团这类保质期短的商品缺货，连超市货架上、生鲜电商平台上的方便面和速冻饺子都被抢购一空了。
After rework, Lin Duo, a supermarket and convenience store, found that not only the convenience store freezer, rice dumplings with short shelf life, but also supermarket shelves, fresh electricity platform instant noodles and frozen dumplings were sold out.
超市里的方便面、速冻水饺被抢购一空来源/ 受访者供图在豆果站内，一个有趣的现象是，泡面、速冻饺子的创意吃法内容，在疫情期间上传新增增长103%。
2007-9-24 16: 23 [hide] Instant noodles, frozen dumplings were snapped up in supermarkets One interesting phenomenon is that the creative content of noodles and frozen dumplings increased by 103% during the outbreak.
这些食品的线上销售数据增长也较为明显。
The growth in online sales of these foods has also been significant.
京东方面的数据显示，从除夕到初九（同比去年春节同期），全站方便类食品成交金额增长了3.5倍；多点Dmall相关负责人告诉燃财经，疫情期间（农历腊月二十六到正月初七），多点全平台到家订单量，速食冻品同比增长241%，尤其是速食、速冻及自加热食品品牌的订单量较去年同时段春节期间都有42%-99%的增长。
From New Year's Eve to February 9, the same period last year, transactions of convenience food items increased 3.5-fold. During the Lunar New Year's Day to the seventh day of the first month, orders for multi-point full-scale orders rose 241 percent year-on-year, especially for fast-food, frozen and self-heating food brands.
曾被外卖打败的方便类、速冻类食品，为什么在春节期间备受追捧？小恒水饺创始人李恒告诉燃财经，他就是抢购方便面大军中的一员——在大年初二当天从超市、电商平台各个渠道买，当天就囤了10箱方便面。
Li Heng, founder of xiaoheng dumplings, told Flaming Finance that he was one of the top buyers of instant noodles purchased from supermarkets and e-commerce platforms on the second day of the Lunar New Year, according to Li Heng, founder of xiaoheng dumplings.
不过他坦言，速冻品、方便类食品脱销，是受疫情影响部分物资紧缺情况下的暂时状态，待工厂陆续复工，物流恢复，市场供不应求的局面可能将不再继续。
However, he admitted that the quick-frozen products, convenient food sales, is affected by the outbreak of some of the material shortages in a temporary state, until factories resume work, logistics resume, the market demand may not continue.
统一企业日前公开表示，全国已有八成工厂复工，主要生产方便面和饮料产品，但由于还有人员回流等问题，个别工厂还没有满线生产。
Eight out of 10 factories across the country have returned to work, producing instant noodles and drinks, but individual factories have yet to produce at full capacity because of problems such as returning workers, Unicom said publicly.
“而速冻品是有机会的，这次是整个速冻和零售行业消费升级的机会，也是部分餐饮品类的机会。
"There are opportunities for quick-frozen products, this time for the entire frozen and retail industry to upgrade consumption, but also for some food items.
”李恒称，类似于火锅、水饺这样的品类，既可以做餐饮门店，又可以做冷冻食品，如火锅底料、羊肉片等等。
Similar to hotpot, dumplings and so on, Li said, there are both restaurants and frozen foods, such as hotpot ingredients and sliced mutton.
在他看来，受疫情影响，当大部分人不外出就餐时，一些速冻品和零售品正是这样的餐企的机会；目前火爆的生鲜行业，其本质是速冻和零售行业的升级版，只要产品做得足够好，甚至有望侵占传统企业的份额。
In his view, the epidemic's impact, when most people do not eat out, is the opportunity for some fast-frozen and retail products; the current booming fresh industry is essentially an upgraded version of the frozen and retail industry, as long as the product is done well enough that it is likely to encroach on the share of traditional businesses.
在李恒的规划里，小恒水饺2020年要将自家工厂50%的速冻品销往生鲜电商、电商的零售渠道，第一年，零售渠道的销售额计划占小恒水饺总收入的20%-30%，未来理想的比例是5:5。
Mr. Li's plan is to sell 50% of his factory's frozen dumplings in 2020 to retail outlets for fresh electricity producers and retailers. In the first year, retail sales are planned to account for 20% to 30% of Xiao Heng's total turnover, compared with an ideal ratio of 5: 5 in the future.
李恒认为，餐饮行业的未来，一定是门店和零售的结合。
Li Heng believes that the future of the catering industry, must be a combination of stores and retail.
“这一模式在一些国家已经被验证过了，只是国内餐饮业发展较慢，这次突发的疫情会推动很多餐饮老板去变革，或者促使餐饮和速冻零售行业合作甚至融合，比如速冻和零售品牌想餐饮化，或者餐饮企业想零售化，那就要跨界合作。
"This model has been proven in some countries, but the domestic restaurant industry is slow to develop, and the outbreak will push many restaurant owners to change, or to co-operate or even merge the catering and frozen retail industries, such as fast-frozen and retail brands, or the restaurants sector wants to be retail, cross-border cooperation.
”餃子の王将门店来源 / 网络风靡日本的餐饮连锁品牌王将饺子（餃子の王将)走的就是“餐饮+零售”的路线。
"Wen Zi-wang took the" catering + retail "route to make dumplings, the Japanese restaurant chain Wang Zi-Jie.
据李恒介绍，这个品牌在日本有800多家门店，零售产品重点销往香港、澳门和新加坡等海外市场。
According to Mr. Li, the brand has more than 800 stores in Japan, with retail sales focused on overseas markets such as Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore.
半成品、调味料销量上涨可能只是虚假繁荣疫情来袭，餐饮行业在销售旺季遭遇寒冬，不少知名品牌在自家门口做起了“卖菜”的生意，然而有危有机，一些餐饮企业转战线上推出了半成品食材，反而销路不错。
Semi-finished products, seasoning sales may be just a boomerang epidemic, the catering industry in the sales season encountered winter, many well-known brands in the home from the "selling" business, but dangerous organic, some restaurants on the front line launched semi-finished food, but sales are good.
京东、每日优鲜等平台与线下餐饮品牌合作，开拓标品菜、半成品速食生产。
Beijing East, Daily Fresh and other platforms and offline catering brand cooperation, open up standard dishes, semi-finished fast food production.
京东上线的“餐饮零售发展联盟”中，包括海底捞、小南国、西贝莜面村、广州酒家在内的百余家餐饮企业销售半成品食材。
"Restaurant retail development alliance" on the line, including bottom fishing, small south, Xibei naked oats village, Guangzhou Restaurant, more than 100 catering enterprises selling semi-finished food materials.
京东方面的数据显示，1月18日（除夕前一周）至今，半加工蔬菜成交额增长超过142%；方便菜成交额同比增长141%。
From January 18, the week before New Year's Eve, turnover of semi-processed vegetables has risen by more than 142 percent, and that of convenience vegetables by 141 percent year on year, according to Jingdong.
每日优鲜合伙人兼CFO王珺透露，与传统餐企跨界合作，除了保障每日优鲜成品菜、半成品菜的供应，主要还是集中在方便菜、懒人菜的开发上，这是基于对未来一段时间内，用户不方便到线下餐厅吃饭、不方便叫外卖的判断。
The Daily Fresh Partner and CFO Jun reveals that the cross-border collaboration with traditional food companies, in addition to safeguarding the daily supply of finished and semi-finished vegetables, is mainly focused on the development of convenience foods and lazybones, based on the judgment that it is not convenient for users to eat in an offline restaurant and order take-out for some time.
多点Dmall也发现了这一机会，相关负责人告诉燃财经，至少到3月底，在家做饭仍将会是主流，为应对大众的消费需求和就餐习惯，多点正在上线生鲜餐饮标品，比如香菇油菜、尖椒土豆等。
At least until the end of March, cooking at home will still be the mainstay, with more items such as mushroom rape and peppers and potatoes being served on-line in response to popular consumer demand and eating habits.
宋齐也是在春节期间开始接触半成品食材的，“复工（在家办公）以后没有时间再继续买菜、洗菜、切菜的全流程了，半成品菜连调味品放多放少都不用动脑筋，懒人必备。
Song Qi also began to contact the semi-finished ingredients during the Spring Festival, "back to work (work from home) no longer have time to continue to buy vegetables, vegetables, cutting the whole process, semi-finished vegetables even more seasonings do not have to use their minds, lazy people must.
”她对燃财经表示。
'she says of Flaming Finance.
在堂食、外卖受阻的情况下，半成品速食的全渠道市场成为餐饮企业现阶段的止损方式，那么历经此次疫情，餐企提供的半成品触达了更多的客群，会不会借此机会继续开发一些预包装产品，将这种方式作为抗风险的方式之一？疫情过后，生鲜电商平台还能不能守住“菜篮子”？餐饮行业从业者吴晓告诉燃财经，目前半成品食材的销量增长，是因为堂食、外卖停摆，消费者难以做出复杂且接近餐厅的菜品，半成品食材的需求自然会增加，等一切恢复后，需求也就回落了。
After the outbreak, the whole channel market for ready-to-eat becomes a way for restaurants to stop their losses at this stage. After the epidemic, will the semi-finished products offered by the restaurant enterprises reach more customers? Wu Xiao, a restaurant operator, will take this opportunity to continue to develop some semi-finished products.
观见餐饮小学发起人、瑞幸企业顾问汪洁的态度同样不乐观。
The attitude of Wang Jie, the initiator of catering primary school and consultant to Ruiqing, is also not optimistic.
在她看来，春节期间很多餐饮品牌销售净菜和半成品菜，本质是清库存的动作，这在疫情初期是经营的补充，不会成为常态。
In her view, during the Spring Festival many food brands sell vegetables and semi-finished vegetables, the essence of the inventory of the action, which is in the early stage of the epidemic is a supplement to business, will not become the norm.
“退一步讲，即便有餐饮企业开辟了这个方向，但是也不会有太多，因为餐饮的价值呈现还是在烹饪的部分，而且卖净菜和半成品菜这件事，已经有很多生鲜电商在做了，餐饮企业也不一定具备这些平台的优势。
"To say the least, even if catering companies are moving in this direction, it won't be too much, because the value of food is still in the cooking part, and there are already a lot of fresh and semi-finished vegetables being sold, and restaurants don't necessarily have the advantages of these platforms.
”汪洁说。
"said Wang Jie.
在京东反馈的数据中，调味品也是涨势较为明显的品类之一。
In Jingdong feedback data, seasoning is also one of the more obvious categories.
2020年1月18日（除夕前一周）至今，京东平台调味品成交额增长超过129%，其中，酱菜/榨菜、酱油/蚝油、火锅调料成交额占比最高。
Between January 18, 2020 (the week before New Year's Eve) and the present, the turnover of seasonings on the Jingdong platform has increased by more than 129%, with the highest percentage of pickles / lettuce, soy sauce / oyster sauce and hotpot seasonings.
燃财经联系到欣和集团相关负责人，对方反馈从天猫及京东平台各店铺销售数据看，同比往年节后数据有明显增幅；电商平台旗舰店访客超过同期30%，成交订单量是同比的2倍。
The company has contacted the relevant officials of Xin He Group and received feedback that the sales figures for the Tien Cat and Jingdong platforms showed a marked increase over the previous year.
但增长更多是受疫情影响，因线下受限改为线上购买的行为，电商平台的转化率也比平常高出很多倍。
But growth was more affected by the epidemic, as offline restrictions were replaced by online purchases, and the conversion rate of electrical and commercial platforms was many times higher than usual.
吴晓同样倾向于认为，调味品在电商平台的销量见涨，更多是在疫情特殊时期，消费者的购买渠道转为线上所致。
Wu also tends to believe that the rise in sales of condiments on electric platforms is due more to the shift in consumers' buying channels to online during a particular period of the epidemic.
整体而言，他认为调味品的市场还是受餐饮行业发展影响较大，目前疫情期间全国餐厅几乎全部歇业，调味品的销量总体比往年只降不升。
Overall, he said, the market for condiments was still heavily influenced by the development of the catering industry. During the current epidemic almost all restaurants were closed and sales of condiments had generally declined only slightly over the previous years.
灶坐联合创始人钟芳倒是发现了一个商机。
Cooking co-founder Chung Fang is finding a business opportunity.
她之前在韩国发现了智能烹饪机，团队判断在国内的市场空间会更大，于是以同样的方式搬到了国内，并在年前已经小规模投放市场。
Having previously found a smart cooking machine in South Korea, the team decided there would be more room in the domestic market and moved in the same way, placing it on the market on a smaller scale a year ago.
这款智能烹饪机的特点是一对一，也就是说，需要搭配官方研发的标准化餐品。
The Smart Cooking Machine features one-on-one, which means it needs to be paired with an officially developed standardized meal.
据燃财经了解，不像便利店的餐品是熟食或半成品，智能烹饪机的餐品也是餐盒形式，不过是生食，用户取餐扫码支付，机器便会自动烹饪。
Unlike convenience stores, where meals are cooked or semi-finished, Smart Cooking Machine meals are in the form of a lunch box, according to Flammable Finance.
钟芳告诉燃财经，“机器的成本可以压缩到非常低，到时候会以用户购买多少套餐品送机器的形式销售。
"The cost of a machine can be compressed to a very low level, and then it will be sold in terms of how many sets of food the user buys," Zhong told Flaming Finance.
单份餐品定价在20元左右。
The price of a single meal is around 20 yuan.
”灶坐卖的不是硬件，核心是从餐品上获利。
The cooker sells not hardware, but profit from the meal.
随着疫情蔓延，“各个大公司陆续开工以后，最核心的诉求是减少人群聚集，甚至避免人与人之间过多的接触，我们这个项目就可以在满足这个要求的情况下，解决员工吃饭的问题。
As the epidemic spreads, "as major companies begin to build, the central demand is to reduce crowds and even avoid too much human contact, and our project will be able to meet this requirement."
”钟芳表示，不过目前团队的重点放在To B业务上，面向C端用户的产品已经在研发阶段了，但要等到工厂复工之后才能启动生产。
But for now, the team is focusing on ToB, where products for C-end users are already in the development stage but can't start production until the plant resumes work, says Ms Chung.
对于这种商业模式，吴晓表示，作为堂食、外卖的补充尚可，但不会有太大的市场空间。
For this business model, Wu Xiao said, as a soup, take-out supplement is reasonable, but will not have too much market space.
“To B 场景或许可以，但是很难想象终端用户会在自己家里摆一台这样的机器，轮流吃上百种餐品。
"The To B scenario might work, but it's hard to imagine the end user setting up a machine like this in their own home and taking turns eating hundreds of different meals.
”他认为，在很长一段时间里，智能科技对餐饮的渗透和改变，会是一个趋势，但是也只会适应于便利店和部分餐饮门店场景，不适合C端用户在家拥有。

赛富投资基金首席合伙人阎焱称这是一个社会学问题，他认为人的一大特点是记忆特别短暂，且很难改变，年轻一代如果已经习惯了叫外卖，可能不会因为一场疫情就改变习惯。
Yan Xiang, chief partner of the Saiful Investment Fund, called it a sociological problem, saying that memory is particularly short-lived and hard to change, and that younger generations might not change habits because of an epidemic if they were used to takeaway.
金沙江创投主管合伙人朱啸虎认为，人的天性是懒惰的，在家做饭的习惯很难保持下去，疫情结束后，人们在家做饭的次数可能比以前稍微多一些，但很多人还是会恢复叫外卖或外食的习惯。
Zhu Wuhu, the managing partner of Jinsha River, believes that it is hard to maintain the lazy nature of cooking at home. After the outbreak, people may cook at home a little more often than before, but many will return to the practice of ordering take-out or take-out.
“疫情期间所有人长期被关在家里做饭，是不可能持续的，在疫情结束后，这部分需求必定会下降。
"It is unlikely that all people will be kept at home to cook for long periods of time during the epidemic, and that part of the demand is bound to decline after the epidemic ends.
”但李祝捷依然认为“在家吃饭”是一个非常大的赛道，事实上，不惑创投一直在找在这一赛道里做创新的公司。
