经历了漫长的春节假期，在被按下暂停键的武汉，复工，还是不复？这是一个问题。
After a long Spring Festival, in the press suspended Wuhan, resume work, or not? This is a problem.
当大多数人都被迫宅在家时，社畜们已经通过各种形式重新 “营业”。
When most people are forced to stay at home, social animals have been re-established in various ways.
曾经让无数社畜梦寐以求的不坐班成为现实后，“我好想回去上班！”的呐喊回荡在朋友圈。
"I really want to go back to work!" screams echoed in the circle of friends after so many social animals dream of not taking a shift.
于此同时，店主们观望着复工的时机，有些勇士甚至已经尝试开业。
At the same time, shopkeepers are watching to see if they can get back to work, and some have even tried.
还有一些人，在这段黑暗的日子，从来就没有停止工作。
Still others, in these dark days, have never stopped working.
在滴滴平台司机东东看来，他根本就没有所谓“复工”这回事。
To Dongdong, the drip-drip platform driver, there was no such thing as "go back to work."
“最早是在1月25号，平台就开始组织我们出车，主要还是负责社区人员、医护人员的接送，也会送物资之类的。
"As early as January 25, the platform began to organize our trip, mainly responsible for the community, the transport of medical personnel, supplies and so on.
”东东和我说，加上出租车，全武汉每天大约有6000台车供防疫统一调配。
Dongdong and I said that, together with taxis, Wuhan has about 6,000 vehicles a day for unified epidemic prevention.
每个社区会有3-4台车，东东觉得基本上是够用的，有的社区情况严重些，可能用车会紧张。
Each community will have three to four cars, which is generally considered adequate, and some communities are in serious condition and may experience a shortage of vehicles.
“我们一般不敢接送发热或者疑似的患者，身边的朋友也有中招的，所以这样的情况基本上还是有专门的车子来接。
"We generally do not dare to send fever or suspected patients, around the friends also have a move, so this situation is basically a special car to pick up.
”即便是这样，东东一天也要接三四单，“不算太累。
"Even so, take three or four tickets a day," not too tired.
”东东这样回答。
"said Dongdong.
每天说是早上8:30出车，但东东每天很早就得起来，“现在街道和医院工作蛮紧，要去接人，很多人没有出行工具。
Every day it said it was 8: 30 a.m., but Dongdong can get up very early. "Now the streets and hospitals are very busy, and many people do not have the means to travel.
下班也是一样，基本要等到社区人员下班，我们把她们送回去才行。
It's the same with leaving work, basically waiting for the people in the community to leave, we have to send them back.
不能说到点了我们就下班，那样别个工作人员就回不去了。
We can't get off the job until we order, so the other guys can't get back.
”除了社区人员，东东他们还会接送从方舱医院治愈的患者，“一般出院都是在晚上，最晚的有十一点多的，把别个送回去也快十二点了。
"In addition to the community, they would pick up patients who had been treated at the cabin hospital." The general discharge took place at night, at the latest by eleven o'clock, and it was nearly twelve o'clock to send the others back.
”东东和我说，每个社区的情况不一样，像汉南、经开这样远一点的，社区会安排一日三餐和宾馆住宿。
Dongdong and I said that the situation was different in each community, and that if a little further along the way, the community would arrange three meals a day and hotel accommodation.
他这样跑主城区的，一开始只能有什么吃什么，经常就是泡面。
He ran the main city, the beginning of what can only eat, is often bubble noodles.
后来一些志愿者团队会在每个区分点提供午饭，东东和车友们才解决了问题。
Later, teams of volunteers provided lunch at each of the points, and then Dongdong and the drivers solved the problem.
“家里人还是蛮支持的，不支持的话也不可能搞。
"" My family still supports it, and we can't do it without it.
”东东的车每天会有社区的人员进行消毒，社区的物资还算是充裕，东东之前还领到了两副防护眼镜，“不过我没怎么戴，对开车有影响。
Dongdong's car is disinfected every day by community workers, the community has plenty of supplies, and Dongdong has received two pairs of glasses, "but I don't wear much, which has an impact on driving.
我们戴的基本上是一般的口罩。
What we wear is basically an ordinary mask.
”因为手上的班级是毕业班，也没有授课任务，老徐是从2月8号开始上班的。
As the class was graduating and there was no teaching assignment, Xu began work on February 8.
但他也并不轻松，学校有线上的健康打卡系统，老徐每天都要提醒学生打卡。
But he is not easy, school cable health card printing system, Xu every day to remind students to make a card.
线上办公在老徐看来还算是平常，状态都还好，工作也都能够按时地完成。
On-line office in Lao Xu seems to be normal, the state is good, the work can be completed on time.
目前老徐所在的学校被武汉市政府征用为第二批储备隔离点，学生宿舍里的个人物品要统一收纳管理，这是老徐手头上最大的问题。
At present, Lao Xu's school has been requisitioned by Wuhan city government as the second batch of reserve quarantine points.
“学生们都还算比较配合，我们也知道这件事情很麻烦，现在以班级为单位按男女统计了物品清单。
"The students are quite cooperative and we know it's a bit of a hassle," he said. "Now we have a list of items by class and sex.
应该这几天就会开始动手清理，需要腾空1000个宿舍，工作量还是蛮大的。
Should start to clean up in a few days, need to vacate 1000 dormitory, the workload is still quite large.
”因为是辅导员，搬运物品的时候老徐需要在场，为了保证进度，学校要求在汉的老师都来学校帮忙。
As a counselor, Xu needed to be present when moving things. To keep things moving, the school required all Han's teachers to come to the school to help.
“就目前情况来说，这也是没得选择。
"As things stand, there is no alternative.
”“每天在家憋得慌，没有酒喝。
"" I can't get enough to drink at home every day.
”十八号酒馆员工香菜对于线上办公一时间还不太在状态。
The parsley of the 18 th Tavern is not quite ready for online work.
“我们市场部有时候喝酒才有灵感，现在呆在家的呆在家，滞留武汉的滞留武汉，居家隔离，也不能做什么，无力感是最可怕的。
"We in the marketing department, who are sometimes inspired by alcohol, now stay at home, stay in Wuhan, stay in Wuhan, stay in seclusion, can do nothing, the most terrible feeling of powerlessness.
”初十复工后，香菜和市场部的同事们开了三次线上的会议，也在准备开始每天交日报。
After resuming work in the 10th anniversary year, parsley and marketing colleagues held three online meetings and were preparing to start handing in daily newspapers.
线下门店的同事们，都在宿舍呆着，等待复工。
Off-line shop colleagues, are all in the dormitory, waiting to return to work.
“我家在湖南，在家办公的时候，窗户外面那个宣传大喇叭不停地宣传防疫措施。
"My family in Hunan, working from home, the publicity horn outside the window kept promoting vaccination measures.
开会的时候我只能静音，需要我发言的时候，我再打开。
I can only keep silent in meetings, and I open them when I need to speak.
”香菜和我吐槽，现在的疫情宣传已经升级到湖南花鼓戏版本，每次她的发言都是自带BGM，自己的普通话也不由自主的被带偏成塑料普通话。
Parsley and I spat, and now the epidemic has escalated to a version of Hunan Flower Drum, each time with her own BGM, and her Mandarin was involuntarily biased into Putonghua.
“家里人还会抱着猫进来看望一下我。
The family will come in and visit me with the cat.
”尽力减少损失是香菜所在的企业目前最大的愿望。
Trying to minimize losses is the biggest desire of the companies where the carrots are found.
“我们最棘手的问题就是原料和物流的问题，除了门店，我们的酒厂年前还有几十吨酒放在发酵罐里，哪怕外地客户复工了要买酒，我们也没办法发出去。
"Our toughest problem is raw materials and logistics," he said. "In addition to the stores, our winery had dozens of tons of fermented wine in the fermenter years ago.
”“有空来聊聊复工吗？”“没空，昨晚加班到11点，今天忙得晕头转向。
"" Do you have time to talk about getting back to work? "" No, I didn't have time to work late last night.
你给我发文字，我能写了给你，视频不行，顾不上。
You send me text, I can write it to you, no video, no care.
”这是呆毛给我的回复。
"Here is the reply from Foolish Mao.
1月30号开始复工的呆毛，目前人在北京，原定初五回武汉的她已经在家工作了13天。
The daze, who started work on January 30, is now in Beijing and has been working from home for 13 days since her original five-day visit to Wuhan.
据她了解，公司的大部分人已经开始复工了，正式上班时间暂定3月1号。
According to her understanding, most of the company has begun to resume work, the official business hours tentatively March 1.
“我和你说，在家办公真的是各种不方便！比如效率不高，容易倦怠。
"I tell you, it's really inconvenient to work from home! For example, it's inefficient and easy to be tired.
和同事交流起来词不达意，因为大家都在忙，实在没办法的情况才打一个语音电话。
It's hard to communicate with colleagues, because everyone is busy, there is no way to make a voice call.
”呆毛聊起在家的工作各种无奈。
"Foolish Mao chatted about all kinds of helplessness at home.
“除了工作的不适应，还有就是家里的琐事。
Besides the maladjustment in work, there are the little things at home.
家里电视的声音一大，语音电话就听不清了。
The sound of the TV at home is so loud that I can't hear it clearly.
正在忙的时候，家人会突然问你吃不吃水果，喝不喝酸奶。
While you are busy, your family will suddenly ask you to eat no fruit, drink yogurt.
到了饭点，就开始叫你吃饭... ...我真的太难了。
When it's time to eat, I start to tell you to eat... I'm really hard.
”除了不用挤公交地铁，呆毛觉得在家办公一点也不好。
"It's not good to work from home except on the subway.
“作为运营，虽说规定早上9点上班打卡，晚上6点下班，但现在晚上加班已经是基本操作了，24小时待命。
"As a rule of thumb, I work nine in the morning and six in the evening, but now I work overtime on a 24-hour basis.
”“为啥复工上班？别问，问就是穷！”即使隔着屏幕，我也能体会到小刘的无奈。
"" Why go back to work? Don't ask, ask is poor! "Even across the screen, I could feel Xiao Liu's helplessness.
小刘是睡不着俱乐部的老板，店是去年才正式开始营业的，“原先的计划是除夕休息，初一到初三营业时间缩短，从1月28号开始便正常营业。
Xiao Liu, the owner of the sleepless club, only opened last year. "The original plan was to relax on New Year's Eve and shorten the opening hours from the first to the third day of junior high school.
”而现在，2月12号才复工，比原计划整整晚了半个月。
But work only resumed on February 12, a full half-month behind schedule.
“从昨天我就开始线上接单了，目前还是依赖外卖订单，到店里也只能是做好后外带，现在一共有三单。
"I've been on-line since yesterday, and I'm still relying on take-out orders and can only go to the store with three orders now.
”小刘最担心的还是在这个特殊时期，骑手比较少，送货会比较慢，咖啡很容易就凉了。
"Xiao Liu was most worried about the lack of riders, slower deliveries and the ease with which coffee could cool at this particular time.
虽然咖啡豆的供应商还没有复工，但目前小刘的店里咖啡豆的库存还够，开始营业也是想解决掉库存。
Although the coffee bean supplier has not yet returned to work, Xiao Liu's stock of coffee beans is still sufficient, and the start of business is also intended to eliminate inventory.
“原来的营业时间是到晚上九点，现在的营业时间是从一点半到六点，晚上基本上就没办法了，营业时间因为送货的原因，缩短了一半。
"The original business hours were until 9 pm, and now the business hours are from 1: 30pm to 6: 00pm, basically no way at night, because of the delivery time, reduced by half.
”小刘告诉我，目前武汉市咖啡店复工的很少，一些酒吧都提供了外卖和自提服务。
Xiao Liu told me there were few coffee shops in Wuhan that had reopened, and some offered take-out and pick-up services.
大家都在想办法自救。
Everybody's trying to save themselves.
下午6:32分，L同学在打卡的间歇才看到我上午发给他的信息。
At 6: 32 p.m., L students in the punch card break to see the message I sent him this morning.
“忙，之前坐班的时候是996，现在快成007了。
"Busy, I used to work 996, but now it's almost 007.
” L同学1月30号开始复工，没有明确的工作时间和休息时间，线上办公让工作成为了随叫随到的无底洞。
Class L returned to work on January 30, with no clear working hours or breaks, and making work an on-call tunnel.
“每天仿佛有做不完的工作，早晚的视频会议已是常态，每天的签到变成了红包接龙。
"Every day seems to have endless work, the morning and evening videoconference has become the norm, every day check-in into a red envelope.
有时候刚躺被窝，想起来还有一个表没做，又要爬起来。
Sometimes just lying under the bed, think of a watch did not do, and to get up again.
”工作压力大，使得同事们在晚上休息后会线上剧本杀或狼人杀。
Stress at work can lead to playbooks being killed or werewolves being killed after a night off.
“不过我都没有参加，每天我做完工作只想躺下睡觉。
"But I didn't attend, and every day when I finished work I just wanted to lie down and sleep.
因为你不知道什么时候工作又来了，只能争分夺秒的多休息一下。
Because you don't know when the work is coming, you just have to take time off and have a good rest.
”因此，沙发地毯被窝都成了他的工位。
"So the sofa-carpet coverings became his workstation.
受疫情影响，作为商务的L同学，联系客户也比之前更有难度，“有的客户年前打算签单，但是现在还没有复工，这也没办法。
As a result of the epidemic, as a business L students, also more difficult to contact customers than before, "some customers plan to sign the bill, but now has not returned to work, this is no way.
还有些就是在非工作时间来找你聊，你不得不加班。
There are also those who come to talk to you outside of work hours and you have to work overtime.
”焦虑的L同学现在迫切地想回去坐班，“无论是工作效率还是工作对接，都是坐班更好。
Anxious L students now desperately want to go back to work. "It's better to be on the shift, whether it's work efficiency or docking.
在家里一忙，我就想辞职。
As soon as I am at home, I want to resign.
同事里有很多人想过辞职，还有些人已经辞职了。
Many of my colleagues have tried to resign, and others have resigned.
”每当看到线上复工后网上的一片吐槽和哀嚎，熊酱只能报以一笑。
Bear sauce can only smile at the sight of spits and howls on the Web when it resumes work.
线上复工比惨，能比的过新媒体狗？新媒体狗比惨，又有谁能比得过拥有一只两岁人形兽的新媒体狗？“我已经很久都不需要闹钟了，毕竟我家人形兽每天早晨可以自动客串人形闹钟。
Who can beat a new media dog with a two-year-old humanoid? "I haven't needed an alarm clock for a long time. After all, my humanoid beast can automatically set a human alarm clock every morning.
当然，这样的人间惨剧只是艰难一天的开始。
Of course, this human tragedy is only the beginning of a difficult day.
”当其它人在抱怨在线办公造成的24小时待命让人窒息的时候，熊酱还得接受来自小孩的全天候暴击。
Bear sauce also has to be exposed to all-weather barrage from kids while others complain about the suffocating 24-hour availability of online work.
“以前在家办公嫌吵还可以让家人把娃带出去溜一圈或者自己出门，现在退无可退。
"It used to be possible for family members to take Eva out for a walk or go out on their own, and now there's no turning back.
连想要找到一个安静一点的地方都找不到。
You can't even find a quiet place.
”于此同时，新冠让熊酱的工作难度陡然上升。
At the same time, the new crown makes it harder for Bear Sauce to work.
这很让她头秃。
It makes her bald.
“毕竟对于大部分武汉新媒体而言，新冠其实是一道超纲题。
"After all, for most new Wuhan media, the new crown is in fact a super-programmatic issue.
”“最近太南了。
"" It's been too south lately.
如果一定要说这段时间有什么收获，那就是我掌握了一边哄娃一边开会、一只手陪娃玩玩具一只手写稿等绝技。
If I have to say what I have gained from this time, it is that I have mastered the feat of playing games with one hand and writing with the other.
”当下，熊酱只有一个最朴素的愿望，“我想去公司上班，真的，求求了！”- 💻-到现在为止，很多城市开始逐渐解封，各个行业也都在重新恢复运转。
At the moment, bear sauce has only one simple wish: "I want to go to work for the company, really, please!" -Chao-so-so-far, many cities are beginning to unpack and industries are getting back to work.
武汉官方复工时间还在20天之后。
Wuhan official time to resume work is still 20 days later.
我看着窗外，树梢上偶尔会有几只麻雀与我对望。
I looked out of the window. Occasionally there were sparrows at the top of the tree looking at me.
是啊，春天来了。
Yeah, spring is here.
