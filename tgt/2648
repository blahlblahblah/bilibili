澎湃新闻记者 刘栋人民日报客户端韩国大邱的病例每天依旧在激增。
The case of Daegu, a client of the Peng Pai News daily, continues to surge daily.
在这场与病毒的殊死搏斗中，日益严重的医疗资源短缺已成为这座城市眼下最紧迫的问题。
In this life-and-death struggle with the virus, the growing shortage of medical resources has become the city's most pressing problem.
目前，超过1600名确诊病人仍在家中等待住院治疗。
More than 1,600 confirmed patients remain at home awaiting hospitalization.
而在过去的这个周末，又有两名在家隔离的患者死亡，目前已有4名患者在等候住院过程中不幸过世。
Over the weekend, two more patients died in isolation at home, and four have died while waiting to be hospitalized.
大邱市警方证实，3月1日下午6时30分，大邱市寿城区的一位77岁女子在家中死亡。
Police in Daegu confirmed that a 77-year-old woman died at her home in Daegu city at 6.30 p.m. on March 1.
该患者在前一天被确诊，同时患有慢性疾病和肝癌等潜在疾病。
The patient had been diagnosed the previous day and was suffering from chronic diseases and potential diseases such as liver cancer.
这是韩国第22例死亡，也是第四位在等待住院期间死亡的患者。
It was the 22nd death in South Korea and the fourth to die while awaiting hospitalization.
据《韩民族新闻》报道，就在不到两个小时前，另一名在家隔离的86岁确诊女性由于出现呼吸急促被紧急送往医院抢救，不治身亡。
Less than two hours ago, another 86-year-old woman, who was isolated at home, died when she was rushed to hospital with shortness of breath, the National News reported.
据警方统计，包括当天早些时候在医院中的3起死亡病例，仅3月1日一天，大邱市就新增了5例死亡病例，是疫情发生以来死亡人数最高的一天。
According to police statistics, including three deaths in hospitals earlier in the day, Daegu alone saw five new deaths on March 1 alone, the deadliest since the outbreak.
据韩国政府披露，就在两天前，已有两名确诊病患在家隔离等候病床时，由于病情突然恶化，送医不治身亡。
Just two days ago, two patients were hospitalized when their condition suddenly deteriorated while waiting for their beds in isolation, the government said.
越来越多人呼吁政府采取更细化的紧急措施来照顾不同患者，避免更多人在等待住院期间死亡。
More and more people are calling on the government to take more detailed emergency measures to care for different patients and avoid many more dying while waiting to be hospitalized.
对此，大邱市市长权泳臻在周末的记者会上痛心疾呼，“我们已经达到容量的极限，可以保证的病床数量增长远远赶不上病人增加的速度，而且我们严重缺乏医务人员。
In response, Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin lamented at a weekend press conference: "We have reached the limits of our capacity, the number of beds we can assure is growing much more slowly than the number of patients, and we have a serious shortage of medical staff."
”大邱市政府称，截至3月1日，大邱又增添了1329张床位，488位患者可以在周末入院，但是仍然不能够满足井喷式增长的需要。
As of March 1, 1,329 beds had been added to Daegu, and 488 patients could be admitted on weekends, but that was still not enough to meet the surge, the city government said.
韩国中央防疫对策本部2日通报，截至当天下午4时，韩国较当天0时新增新冠肺炎确诊病例123例，累计确诊病例达4335例，其中大邱已超3000例。
As of 4: 00 pm on the same day, the Republic of Korea had 123 new confirmed cases of pneumonia, with a total of 4,335 confirmed cases, including more than 3,000 cases of Daegu, the central anti-epidemic agency said.
根据韩国防疫部门的数据，大邱超过80%的患者症状相对较轻，其余20%的患者需要迅速住院治疗。
More than 80% of patients in Daegu have relatively mild symptoms, with the remaining 20% requiring prompt hospitalization, according to the Korea Preventive Service.
韩国国家医疗中心负责人郑基铉(Chung Ki-hyun，音译)在3月1日的新闻发布会上表示，对于大邱的医疗资源短缺问题，当务之急是尽快建立起一个病人护理和管理系统，将医疗资源有效地分配到最急需的地方。
In a press conference on March 1, Chung Ki-hyun, head of the National Medical Center, said it was imperative that a system of patient care and management be put in place as soon as possible to allocate medical resources to where they are most needed.
为此，韩国中央灾难安全对策本部1日发布了新版治疗管理方案，该方案把重点放在重症患者的治疗上，将有限的医院床位分配给优先病人或病情较重的病人，同时兼顾到轻症患者，安排他们到院外设施接受治疗。
To this end, Korea Central Disaster Safety Response Headquarters issued a new version of the treatment management programme on the 1, which focuses on the treatment of severe patients, limited hospital beds allocated to priority patients or patients with more serious illness, taking into account the light patients, arranged for them to receive treatment in out-of-hospital facilities.
根据新方案，患者根据病情轻重分为轻症患者、中症患者、重症患者、最重症患者。
According to the new plan, patients according to the severity of the disease into light, moderate, severe, the most serious patients.
中症以上患者迅速安排在负压病房或是国家定点医院接受治疗，轻症患者则安排到设于公立设施的“生活治疗中心”接受治疗。
Patients with moderate or above symptoms are treated quickly in a negative pressure ward or a state designated hospital, while patients with mild cases are treated in a "living therapy centre" located in a public facility.
“生活治疗中心”也配有医疗人员，根据医疗人员的判断，轻症患者可随时转入医院接受治疗。
Medical staff are also available at the Life Treatment Centre and, at the discretion of medical staff, patients with minor illnesses can be transferred to hospitals for treatment at any time.
中症以上患者若病情好转出院，将根据主治医生和患者管理工作组的判断是送到“生活治疗中心”接受治疗或是回家休养。
If the patient is in good condition and is discharged from hospital, he will be sent to "life treatment center" or go home to recuperate according to the judgment of the attending doctor and patient management team.
方案指出，“生活治疗中心”由各地方政府各自指定，周边医疗机构提供医疗支援。
The program states that "life treatment centers" are designated by each local government and medical support is provided by the surrounding medical institutions.
大邱市长权泳臻在1日晚上证实，大邱市将从2日起在教育部中央教育研修院开启第一个“生活治疗中心”，由庆北大学医院提供医疗管理。
Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin confirmed on the night of Monday that Daegu would open its first "life treatment centre" at the Ministry of Education's Central Education Research Institute, with medical management provided by Gyeongbei University Hospital.
预计首批收治160多人，将有医护人员24小时照料。
The initial intake of more than 160 patients is expected to be attended by medical staff on a 24-hour basis.
韩联社的报道称，政府在治疗中心给患者准备了体温计、药品、内衣、口罩等个人生活盥洗用具，同时饮食和零食也全部免费。
The government has prepared personal toiletries such as thermometers, medicines, underwear and masks for patients at treatment centers, and food and snacks are free of charge, the newspaper said.
在大邱疫情处于最严峻时刻之时，韩国国内也伸出了援助之手。
At the height of the Daegu epidemic, South Korea offered a helping hand at home.
“我们将接收和治疗来自大邱的确诊患者。
"We will receive and treat confirmed patients from Daegu.
我请求光州市民在这场战斗中给予支持，”光州市长李庸燮（Lee Yong-sup 音译）3月1日在新闻发布会上说道。
I asked the citizens of Kwangju to lend their support in the battle, "Lee Yong-sup, the mayor of Kwangju, said at a news conference on March 1.
他表示，将为大邱病人提供出全市105个隔离病床的一半，以作支持。
He said he would provide half of the city's 105 isolation beds for Daegu patients.
