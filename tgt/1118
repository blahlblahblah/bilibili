经济观察网 记者 刘可连日奔袭一千公里后，宋翔雷终于到了湖北武汉。
The economic observation network reporter Liu Ke day after a thousand kilometers, Song Xianglei finally arrived in Hubei Wuhan.
。
.
开货车十几年了，来武汉这么多次，但这还是宋翔雷第一次能将车开上武汉三环内。
Driving a truck more than 10 years, came to Wuhan so many times, but this is the first time that Song Xianglei can drive up Wuhan three rings.
车窗外划过的风景依旧是熟悉的林立高楼与城市街景，但太静了，因为带着口罩而略显沉重的呼吸声在无边的寂静中被放大，宋翔雷似乎能听到自己心跳的声音。
The scenery outside the car window was still familiar with skyscrapers and city streets, but it was too still, for the slightly heavy breath of wearing a mask was magnified in the boundless stillness and Song Xianglei seemed to hear his heart beating.
。
.
在货车的后备箱整齐地码放着一箱箱肠道微生态调节剂金双歧。
In the trunk of the van neatly placed a box of small intestinal microecological regulators Bifidobacterium.
这些药品由万泽股份捐赠，在《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）》中，肠道微生态调节剂被列入新型肺炎治疗措施之一。
The drugs, donated by Wan Ze shares, are included in the "Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia due to New Coronavirus Infection (Trial Version 5)" as one of the new measures for treating pneumonia.
。
.
向武汉开去。
It's heading for Wuhan.
从北京开往内蒙古的路上，宋翔雷就接到了公司的电话。
On the way from Beijing to Inner Mongolia, Song Xianglei received a telephone call from the company.
经理在电话那头告诉他，从内蒙古装上的货是要发往武汉的。
The manager told him on the phone that the goods loaded from Inner Mongolia would be sent to Wuhan.
宋翔雷开货车十几年，常常南下，从北京到上海，到湖南，到广州都开过，公司这次派他去武汉，宋翔雷没觉得特别意外。
Song Xianglei drove a truck more than 10 years, often south, from Beijing to Shanghai, Hunan, to Guangzhou, the company sent him to Wuhan, Song Xianglei did not feel particularly surprised.
。
.
从内蒙古直接开车去武汉一般需要30个小时，但因为武汉当地接货商周日不上班没人收货，所以周四下午从内蒙古双奇药业装上药品后，宋翔雷还是先回了一趟北京。
It usually takes 30 hours to drive directly from Inner Mongolia to Wuhan, but Song Xianglei returned to Beijing Thursday afternoon after receiving the medicine from Shuangqi Pharmaceutical Company in Inner Mongolia as no one received the goods when they were off duty on weekdays.
。
.
在出发前，宋翔雷给父母和女朋友都打了电话，通话时间很短，家人都没有多说什么，只是嘱咐他要注意安全，注意防护，记得戴口罩。
Before setting out, Song Xianglei telephoned his parents and girlfriends and spoke for a short time. His family said nothing more than to tell him to be safe, watch out, and remember to wear a mask.
宋翔雷也没把这一趟去武汉当成是多么艰难的任务，也无需做太多的心理建设。
Song Xianglei also did not take this trip to Wuhan as what a difficult task, also do not need to do too much psychological construction.
对宋翔雷来说，这还是一个活儿，一个总要有人去做的活儿。
For Song Xianglei, this is still a job, a job that always has to be done by someone.
。
.
直到从北京临到出发之前，宋翔雷才有了些“去武汉”的实感。
It was not until the departure from Beijing that Song Xianglei had some sense of "going to Wuhan."
这次出发，宋翔雷手头上多了两样东西，一个是内蒙古交通厅发的特别通行证，这个证能让宋翔雷一路上畅通无阻并且免交高速费；还有一样就是公司只给去往武汉的司机发的N95口罩，虽然只有三个。
This time around, Song Xianglei had two more things on his hand. One was a special pass issued by Inner Mongolia's transportation department, which allowed him to travel unimpeded and without high-speed fees.
。
.
从北京到河北，再到河南，直到开到湖北地界，宋翔雷明显感觉到高速上车少了很多，尤其是私家车基本上都不太看得到了。
From Beijing to Hebei, then Henan, to Hubei land boundary, Song Xianglei obviously felt that the high-speed car is much less, especially private cars are not very visible.
“基本上都是货车，路上的车相比来说平常有十辆，现在就两辆，特别少。
"They're basically wagons. There are usually ten cars on the road, but now there are only two.
”宋翔雷说。
"said Song Xianglei.
。
.
公司就给发了三个口罩，只有下高速到服务区打热水吃饭或者是到了加油站，宋翔雷才会把口罩给带上。
The company gave out three masks and only went down to the service area to get hot water for dinner or to the gas station before Song Xianglei would take the mask with him.
不少小的服务区都关了，就算是开着的服务区一进去也是基本上看不到人。
Many small service areas are closed, even the open service area is almost invisible when one enters.
。
.
宋翔雷见到的每个人都带着口罩，真遇上了，大家也没什么交谈的欲望。
Song Xianglei saw everyone wearing masks, really met, we do not have the desire to talk.
宋翔雷觉得大家都有点避着人走的意思，不愿意开口说话，也不愿意和陌生人靠得太近。
Song Xiang-lei felt that everyone was a little shy of people, unwilling to speak, or too close to strangers.
宋翔雷也是加完油就赶紧离开，以前宋翔雷觉得坐在车上开车腰酸腿疼，想要踏到平地上舒展放松，现在却又觉得货车上那点小地方才是安全，最起码在车里不用戴口罩。
Before Song Xianglei felt the pain of driving in a car and wanted to relax on the flat ground, but now he felt that the little place on the truck was safe, at least not wearing a mask in the car.
。
.
离湖北越近，宋翔雷越是能在高速上看到挂着“驰援武汉”横幅的大货车。
The closer he was to Hubei, the more Song Xianglei was able to see a truck with a banner saying "Help Wuhan" on the highway.
本来宋翔雷的货车上也准备挂一个横幅，但又因为没有准备挂钩而作罢。
Song Xiang-lei's truck was also about to carry a banner, but did not prepare to hook up.
。
.
一路上，每到一个高速口，都能遇到临检的交警。
Along the way, every high-speed to a junction, can meet the traffic police.
测体温，看证件，登记身份信息，宋翔雷对这一套现在熟得很。
Body temperature, read documents, registration of identity information, Song Xianglei is now familiar with this set.
交警看到宋翔雷拿着的特别通行证，也不会对他有太特别的注意。
Traffic police see Song Xianglei with the special pass, will not have too special attention to him.
就算是已经到了全省封闭的湖北，宋翔雷自己也越来越觉得，湖北还是那个湖北，新闻里看到的全面封严的湖北更像是只呈现在新闻里。
Even if it has been to the province's closed Hubei, Song Xianglei himself increasingly feel that Hubei is still that Hubei, the news see the overall closed Hubei more like only in the news.
。
.
直到2月10日周一，宋翔雷开过孝感市的大悟、孝感县，终于来到进入武汉的高速口。
Until Monday, Feb. 10, Song Xianglei opened filial piety city, filial piety county, finally came into Wuhan's high-speed mouth.
。
.
还是那个武汉。
It's the same Wuhan.
一路上只要是在车里，宋翔雷就没戴过口罩，戴口罩闷得慌，他也觉得好像没什么必要。
As long as it was in the car, Song Xianglei did not wear a mask, wearing a mask stuffy, he also felt unnecessary.
但一等到进入武汉，宋翔雷就把口罩戴上了。
But as soon as entered Wuhan, Song Xianglei put on his mask.
他也说不上为什么，心里是有点紧张但也没觉得有多害怕，但戴上口罩似乎是进入武汉的一种仪式。
He couldn't say why. He was nervous but didn't feel much afraid, but wearing a mask seemed to be a rite of passage into Wuhan.
武汉能让人感觉到这种仪式的必要性。
Wuhan can make people feel the necessity of this ceremony.
。
.
车平缓地行驶在武汉的街道上，每经过一个大的路口，就有交警让宋翔雷停车检查。
Slowly the car in Wuhan on the streets, every time passing a large junction, traffic police let Song Xianglei stop inspection.
但这次没有交警对宋翔雷将货车开进武汉三环内有什么表示，这在之前是绝不允许的事情。
But there is no traffic police to Song Xianglei into the three rings in Wuhan said that this is not allowed in the past.
。
.
紧张感只持续了不长时间，宋翔雷又没法把眼前的武汉跟新闻中的武汉结合到一起了。
Tension only lasted a short time, Song Xianglei can not in front of Wuhan and the news in Wuhan integrated.
武汉还是那个武汉，一切都还是熟悉的模样，就是街上人少了好多，只让人觉得像是一座城市还没有睡醒。
Wuhan or that Wuhan, everything is still familiar with the appearance, is a lot of people in the streets, just let people feel like a city has not wake up.
。
.
宋翔雷将药品送到了收货方国药控股处，这些金双歧片将会经由国药控股配送到相应的医院中。
Song Xiang-lei sent the medicine to the recipient's state drug holding office, and the tablets will be distributed to the corresponding hospitals through the state drug holding company.
。
.
国药控股来交接的工作人员也只是戴着口罩穿着工作服，跟宋翔雷在武汉之外看到的人们没什么两样。
NICCO's hand-over staff were wearing masks and overalls, much like the people Song Xiang-lei saw outside Wuhan.
交接的过程中很沉默，双方都没有过多的交流，签单收货，跟宋翔雷之前的每一次送货流程也别无二致。
During the handover process was very silent, both sides did not have too much communication, signed the receipt of goods, and Song Xianglei before every delivery process is the same.
。
.
交完了货，宋翔雷没有停留，直到开出了湖北，才把车停到服务区在车上休息，从进入武汉到离开武汉的总时长没有超过一天。
After handing over the goods, Song Xianglei didn't stop until he left Hubei province, then stopped the car to rest in the service area.
宋翔雷每天都跟女朋友通个简短的电话，聊聊家常报个平安。
Every day, he made a short phone call to his girlfriend to talk about his family's safety.
看着夜幕再一次降临, 宋翔雷只觉得是人生中的普通一天又过去了。
Seeing the night come down again, Song Xianglei felt that the ordinary day in his life had passed away.
。
.
在返回北京的路上，在河南驻马店市的服务区中, 宋翔雷接受了记者的采访。
On the way back to Beijing, Song Xianglei was interviewed by a reporter in the service area of Madian City, Henan Province.
就在不久之前,他接到了公司打来的电话跟他说,回北京之后还需要他再来一趟武汉。
Just a short time ago, he received a telephone call from his office and told him that he needed to come back to Wuhan after he returned to Beijing.
。
.
整个春节宋翔雷都没怎么休息,一个月30天，他能有26、2７天都在车上。
During the Spring Festival, Song Xianglei didn't take much rest. For 30 days a month, he was in the car for 26 or 27 days.
对于要再来一趟武汉，宋翔雷也没有太多的情绪。
To want to come to Wuhan again, Song Xianglei also did not have much mood.
“我回到北京也不能回家，本来公司安排我是住到酒店自我隔离，现在公司派了活就来呗，车就是移动的家。
"I can't go home to Beijing either. The company arranged for me to stay in a hotel to insulate myself.
” 宋翔雷说。
"said Song Xianglei.
。
.
２月１２日晚上，刚在当日凌晨回到北京的宋翔雷又上路了，这一次他的目的地仍旧是武汉。
On the night of Feb. 12, Song Xianglei, who had just returned to Beijing in the early hours of the same day, again headed for Wuhan.
如果万一在路上出现发热症状怎么办？宋翔雷只简单的在微信上回复了一句：自我保护，及时汇报。
What if there is a fever on the road? Song Xianglei simply replied on the micro-letter: self-protection, timely reporting.
