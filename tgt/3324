为什么大部分确诊病例会出现在甘肃？输入性病例还会不会持续增加？3月9日晚《新闻1+1》白岩松连线甘肃省卫生健康委员会主任郭玉芬，带来最新消息。
Why do the majority of confirmed cases occur in Gansu? Will the number of imported cases continue to increase? On the evening of March 9, 2007, Kuo Yufen, director of the Health and Hygiene Committee of Gansu Province, was contacted by Baiyansong.
连续16天零新增，为何被打破？从这张甘肃省近一个月新增病例的数据变化图可以看出，从2月18日到3月4日，甘肃新增病例连续16天零增长，但到了3月5日和3月6日，连续两天出现了较多的新增病例，分别达到了11例和17例。
From February 18 to March 4, Gansu Province saw zero growth for 16 consecutive days, but by March 5 and March 6, there were more new cases, 11 and 17 respectively.
根据当地卫健委的通报，这些新增病例都是输入性病例，为什么会出现这样的情况呢？这和近期从伊朗集中回国的300多人有关。
According to the local health committee, the new cases are imported cases, why this situation? This is related to the recent return of more than 300 people from Iran.
3月2日，有2名中国公民从伊朗回到兰州；3月4日，146名中国公民从伊朗乘机抵达兰州；3月5日，又有163名中国公民从伊朗乘机抵达兰州。
On 2 March, two Chinese citizens returned to Lanzhou from Iran; on 4 March, 146 Chinese citizens arrived in Lanzhou by plane from Iran; and on 5 March, 163 more Chinese citizens arrived in Lanzhou by air from Iran.
而这几天，甘肃确诊的病例，正是来自近期回国的这311人。
In the past few days, the 311 cases confirmed in Gansu have come from those recently returned home.
据甘肃省卫生健康委员会主任郭玉芬介绍，经过专家的分析，这33例确诊病例中，2例重症病人，17例普通型，14例轻型，没有危重症病人。
According to Guo Yufen, director of the Gansu Health Commission, two of the 33 confirmed cases were severe, 17 were common and 14 were light.
专家制定了综合的治疗方案，现在这些病例正在定点医院进行救治。
A comprehensive treatment programme has been developed by specialists, and these cases are now being treated in designated hospitals.
近期集中回国人员都是甘肃人吗？此外，郭玉芬还介绍，近期回国的 311人中，有255名是在伊朗上学的中国留学生，占82%左右。
In addition, of the 311 recent returnees, 255, or about 82 percent, were Chinese students studying in Iran, according to Guo.
此外，还有13名教师、26名儿童，以及其他人员。
In addition, there are 13 teachers, 26 children and others.
从人员所属地来看，他们分别来自全国24个省份，其中只有59人来自甘肃。
According to their place of origin, they come from 24 provinces of the country, of which only 59 are from Gansu.
是否有能力救治确诊患者？目前，已有33人确诊感染。
Is it possible to treat confirmed patients? Currently, 33 people have been diagnosed with infection.
当地的救治措施如何？郭玉芬介绍，在抗击新冠肺炎的过程中，甘肃省已经储备了100多家定点医院6000多张床位，仅兰州市就有10家定点医院1000多张床位，同时还组织了两千多名医护人员，做好了相应的准备。
In the fight against pneumonia, Gansu province has more than 6,000 beds in more than 100 designated hospitals, while Lanzhou alone has more than 1,000 beds in 10 designated hospitals, and more than 2,000 medical personnel have been mobilized and prepared, Guo said.
此外，目前已经对所有人进行筛查，只要是有症状的，比如胸片异常、血项检查异常或者出现呼吸道症状等，均采用一对一专用负压救护车送到定点医院进行进一步的检测。
In addition, all persons have been screened for symptoms, such as chest abnormalities, abnormal blood tests or respiratory symptoms, and are transported to designated hospitals in one-to-one negative pressure ambulances for further testing.
目前，在定点医院留观进行医学观察的有60人，正在进行严密的医学观察，同时给予一些预防性的治疗。
At present, 60 people are under medical observation at designated hospitals and are undergoing close medical observation, along with some preventive treatment.
疫情是否会进一步扩大、传染周边居民？郭玉芬介绍，隔离点离兰州市区有70多公里，距离较远，不会对兰州市民造成影响。
Whether the outbreak will further spread and infect the surrounding residents Guo Yufen said the isolation point is more than 70 kilometers from Lanzhou city, a distance that will not affect the citizens of Lanzhou.
同时，隔离点在兰州新区比较偏僻的地方，周边没有居民居住，对兰州新区的影响也很小。
At the same time, the isolation point in Lanzhou New District relatively remote places, the surrounding residents do not live, Lanzhou New District has little impact.
从疫情发生以来到现在，甘肃没有发生医务人员感染、院内交叉感染事件。
Since the outbreak, there have been no cases of medical staff infection and cross-infection in the hospital in Gansu Province.
据甘肃省卫健委最新消息，3月8日20时至3月9日20时，集中回国的311人中，无新增新冠肺炎确诊病例。
According to the latest report of the Gansu Health Commission, from 2000 on March 8 to 2000 on March 9, there were no confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia among the 311 people who were repatriated.
311人中，33例确诊，60人在省级定点医院隔离留观，218人在集中隔离点隔离，正在进一步进行医学检测检查。
