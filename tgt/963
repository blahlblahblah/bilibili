澎湃新闻记者 王选辉 李思文 实习生 许亦莹为防控疫情，此前多地在高速路口进行交通管制，一些还在途中的货车司机遇到了进退两难的境地。
Peng Pai journalist Wang Pai-hui Li Siwen intern Xu Yiying for the prevention and control of the epidemic, many of the high-speed intersection traffic control, some of the truck drivers on the way encountered a dilemma.
Play50岁湖北司机肖红兵的经历近日备受关注。
Play50-year-old Hubei driver Xiao Hongbing's experience has attracted much attention recently.
他1月7日从湖北荆州市出发，辗转多省跑运输，因疫情形势越来越严峻，1月22日送货到四川达州后，他发现自己已无法继续接单送货，也无法回家了。
Departing from Jingzhou, Hubei Province, on January 7, he rushed to and fro through many provinces. As the situation became more serious, he found himself unable to continue receiving delivery orders or returning home after the arrival of the goods in Sichuan Province on 22 January.
此后，他被困在高速上7天，高速路口难下，乡镇道路难行，在服务区只能加油和短暂停留。
Since then, he was trapped on the highway for seven days, high-speed intersection difficult, the township roads difficult, in the service area can only refuel and temporary stay.
直到1月29日下午，陕西汉中的高速民警在应急车道发现了他的鄂M牌照货车和驾驶室中睡觉的他，将他安置下来。
Until the afternoon of January 29, high-speed police in Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province, found his E-M license plate truck and sleeping in the cab and settled him down in the emergency lane.
肖红兵遭遇的现实“囧途”并不是个例。
Xiao Hongbing encountered the reality of the "path" is not unique.
澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）采访多名货车司机了解到，虽有时仍会因疫情遭遇悔单和部分村镇禁行，但车子跑了起来，他们希望保障交通的政策能逐渐彻底贯彻。
Several truck drivers interviewed by the roaring news (www.thepper.cn) learned that, although sometimes repentant about the outbreak and bans on some towns and villages, cars were running and they hoped that the policy of ensuring transportation would be implemented gradually and thoroughly.
日前，国务院办公厅印发通知，就进一步做好公路交通保通保畅工作，确保人员车辆正常通行，切实维护经济社会正常秩序作出专门部署。
A few days ago, the General Office of the State Council issued a circular to further improve road traffic safety, ensure the normal passage of personnel and vehicles, and ensure the normal economic and social order to make special arrangements.
通知要求，调整优化公路交通管控措施，严禁擅自封闭高速公路出入口。
Notice requirements, adjust and optimize road traffic control measures, the unauthorized closure of the highway entrance and exit.
“我现在就想拉完货赶紧回家。
"I want to hurry home after pulling the goods.
”2月11日，被堵路上数天的货车司机林刚（化名）说，当天，他得知他要去装货的县城解禁，允许外地车辆进入。
On February 11, Lin Gang (not his real name), a lorry driver who had been stuck in the road for days, said he was told he was going to unblock the county where he was loading goods and allow foreign vehicles to enter.
等待“解禁”林刚是广西柳州的一名货车司机。
Lin Gang is a truck driver in Liuzhou, Guangxi.
2月4日，他从广西装了一车水果送往山东临沂，这是他2020年接到的第一笔货单。
On February 4, he shipped a load of fruit from Guangxi to Linyi, Shandong Province, the first bill of lading he received in 2020.
在高速上疾驰了两天后，6日中午到达临沂一高速路口，他却被告知因疫情原因，外地车辆一律禁止出高速。
After two days of speeding down the highway, he reached the Linyi highway junction at noon on June 6, but was told that, owing to the epidemic, all non-local vehicles were banned from high-speed.
林刚只能继续沿着高速前进，试图找一个管制较松的出口。
Lin Gang can only continue along the high-speed, trying to find a less regulated exit.
但在和多个高速出口协商后，均被告知没有通行证无法下高速。
But after negotiating with several high-speed exits, they were told they could not get off the highway without a pass.
“我拉的是一车水果，在路上多一天就很容易坏掉。
"I'm pulling a load of fruit and it's easy to break down after one extra day on the road.
”林刚对澎湃新闻说，他当时和货主沟通后，货主要求他把货送往陕西西安，“听说那边运输蔬菜水果的外地车还允许进入。
Lin told the stormy news that after he had talked to the owner, the owner asked him to take the goods to Xi'an, "where he was told that foreign trucks carrying vegetables and fruits were still allowed in.
”但林刚没想到，虽然顺利进入了西安卸货，他却因封路“滞留”在了陕西境内。
But Lin just didn't expect that although he unloaded the goods smoothly in Xi'an, he "stayed" in Shaanxi province because of the road closures.
卸货后，刚好有货主联系林刚，需要将一批产品由咸阳一县城运往广西，这和林刚回家的路线一致。
After unloading, just have cargo owner contact Lin Gang, need a batch of products from Xianyang a county to Guangxi, this and Lin just returned home line.
他说，但因为该厂所在的县城不允许外地车辆进入，他只能在一个货运市场内等待“解禁”。
But because the county where the plant is located does not allow foreign vehicles to enter, he said, he had to wait in a freight market to "unblock."
市场周边的餐厅都已经关门，林刚吃住都在不足两平米的驾驶室内，“我带了大白菜和面条，一天三顿饭都是面条煮白菜和鸡蛋，菜市场不开门，我已经好几天没吃过肉了。
The restaurants around the market were closed and Lin had just eaten and lived in a cab of less than two square meters. "I brought Chinese cabbages and noodles, three meals a day with noodles, cabbage and eggs.
”林刚告诉澎湃新闻，他不敢开车出去，怕外地车牌被查到后劝返。
Lin had just told the stormy news that he was afraid to drive out for fear of being found out about the license plates.
而如果不等待，空车回去就意味着他要自己承担近1万元的油费和过路费，“我就是在赌，赌一个星期会恢复交通。
And if he doesn't wait, leaving the car empty means he'll have to pay nearly $10,000 in gas and tolls. "I'm gambling that traffic will resume in a week
”相比林刚，湖北司机肖红兵此前的遭遇更加窘迫。
"Compared with Lin Gang, Hubei driver Xiao Hongbing's previous experience was more embarrassing.
他告诉澎湃新闻，1月22日到29日被困高速的那几天，因为他的货车是湖北牌照，每到一个地方，他都要给一遍遍给工作人员解释“自己身体正常、检测正常，离开湖北有一段时间了”，但这套说法很难说服当地人。
He told the roar news that he was trapped on the highway from January 22 to 29 because his van was a Hubei license plate and that he had to explain to the staff "his body is normal, normal, and has been away from Hubei for some time," but it was difficult to convince the locals.
一次车开到了陕西宁强。
A car arrived in Ningqiang, Shaanxi Province.
当天，约凌晨一点，肖红兵下了高速，工作人员给他量体温、作登记，并让他重新回到高速。
On the same day, about 1: 00 a.m., Xiao Hong Bing off the high speed, staff took his temperature, registration, and let him back to high speed.
因高速有限速，也不能随意乱停车，为了防止自己睡着，肖红兵困的时候就掐自己大腿、揪头发，实在不行就打脸。
Because of the speed limit, also can not stop at will, in order to prevent themselves from sleeping, Xiao Hong soldiers pinch their own legs, pull their hair, really can not hit the face.
1月29日下午，陕西汉中的高速民警在应急车道发现了这辆货车和驾驶室中睡觉的肖红兵，他满脸憔悴，已经多天没有洗澡和好好睡觉了。
On the afternoon of January 29, high-speed police in Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province, spotted the van and Xiao Hongbing sleeping in the cab in the emergency lane. His face was gaunt and he had not bathed and slept well for days.
肖红兵终于停了下来，此后获得安置，还收到了来自网友的万元捐款。
Xiao Hong Bing finally stopped, after the placement, also received from the netizen yuan donation.
他目前仍滞留在汉中北服务区，已离家一个多月。
He is still in the Hanzhong North Service District and has been away for more than a month.
“着重选择运防疫物资的货单”另一名广西的货车司机吴炳（化名），今年26岁。
"Focused on the selection of epidemic prevention supplies" another Guangxi truck driver Wu Ping (alias), 26 years old.
往年年初三他就会开始接单出车，今年因为疫情原因，他一直等到了正月十三（2月6日）才接到第一个后来成功完成的运单，“不出车就养不起车，每个月有1万多的车贷。
This year he waited until January 13 (Feb. 6) to receive the first successfully completed consignment note. "You can't afford a car without a car, more than 10,000 car loans per month.
”在此之前，吴炳曾接单往广西一村庄装砂糖橘，在驱车200多公里到达后，却被告知非本村车辆不得入内，“货主给我们开了货单，证明是去拉货的，他们也不让过。
Before that, Wu Prem had ordered a village in Guangxi to carry sugar oranges, but when he arrived more than 200 kilometers away, he was told that the non-village vehicles were not allowed in.
”在多次沟通未果后，吴炳只能空车返回，自己负担路费。
After several unsuccessful attempts at communication, Wu Ping returned empty-handed and paid his own way.
2月6日，吴炳从广西装货前往浙江台州，在到达台州一高速出口时，因没有通行证，吴炳只能在高速上等待，3个小时后，货主给他发来了一份通行证。
On February 6, Wu Prem was loading cargo from Guangxi to Taizhou, Zhejiang. When he arrived at Taizhou, he had to wait at high speed because he did not have a permit. Three hours later, the owner sent him a laissez-passer.
虽然等待了一会，但当时吴炳仍然觉得浙江的规定人性化很多。
Although waiting for a while, but then Wu Ping still felt that Zhejiang's provisions are much more humane.
到达浙江后，吴炳发现这里的货单相比广西多了很多，在选择货单时，吴炳会着重选择运防疫物资的货单，“这种是最紧急的，同样都是拉货，我觉得拉物资是最重要的。
When he arrived in Zhejiang Province, Wu Ping found that the list of goods here was much larger than that of Guangxi. When he chose the bill of lading, Wu Bingbing focused on choosing the delivery list of epidemic prevention materials.
”2月9日，吴炳从南京拉了一车消毒液前往浙江台州。
On February 9, Wu Prem took a cart of disinfectant from Nanjing to Taizhou, Zhejiang Province.
他告诉澎湃新闻，防疫物资在运输时会规定一条路线，沿着路线开，一路上都会畅通无阻，“防疫监测站看到是防疫物资的运输单，量了体温就会放行。
He told the roar news that the epidemic prevention materials will be transported along a route that will be unimpeded along the way, "epidemic prevention monitoring stations see is the epidemic prevention materials shipping tickets, after the temperature will be released.
”2月11日接受采澎湃新闻采访时，吴炳正拉着一车雾化器由浙江台州前往广东，已经到达了福建地区。
In a news interview on Feb. 11, Wu Ping was pulling a carload of atomizer from Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, to Guangdong Province, where he had already arrived.
一路上的高速服务区均已关闭餐厅，吴炳三餐只能吃方便面。
High-speed service areas have been closed down, Wu Ping three meals can only eat instant noodles.
但除了必要休息以外，他尽量不耽误时间，希望能尽快将物资送达。
But he tried not to waste time, except for the necessary rest, and wished to have the goods delivered as soon as possible.
前往武汉运送捐赠物资的“85后”爱心司机陈新，则遭遇了下不了高速的情况。
Wuhan to transport donations of "85 after" the love driver Chen Xin, then encountered a high-speed situation.
2月4日，他将福清养鳗专业农民合作社捐赠4000多斤烤鳗顺利运到武汉，并返回福州。
Feb. 4, he donated more than 4000 jin of grilled eels to Wuhan and returned to Fuzhou.
他对澎湃新闻说，虽然曾想过从武汉回来后，会无法回家，需要在外自行隔离。
He told the roar news that although he had thought of returning from Wuhan, he would not be able to go home and would have to isolate himself outside.
但没有想到会困在高速上。
But I didn't expect to get stuck on the freeway.
陈新说，他如实告诉路口收费站的工作人员自己是从武汉回来的，但收费站排查严格，疫区回来的会被遣返。
Chen Xin said he truthfully told the toll booth staff themselves back from Wuhan, but the toll station screening strict, the back of the epidemic area will be repatriated.
各地路口都会排查，问司机是否去过湖北。
Every corner will be checked, ask whether the driver has been to Hubei.
陈新开着冷藏货车，辗转在高速路上各个服务区休息。
Chen Xin drove a refrigerated van and rolled around the service areas on the highway to rest.
饿了就买泡面吃，吃了几天泡面，肠胃不适拉了好几次肚子。
Hungry to buy noodles to eat, eat a few days bubble noodles, gastrointestinal upset several times.
他说，晚上睡在车里，晚上很冷，常常半夜被冻醒，“吃一顿热米饭”是他当时最大的愿望。
He said he slept in his car at night, was cold at night and often woke up in the middle of the night.
就这样过了四五天，直到2月9日，在一个朋友的帮助下，陈新住进了福州一家宾馆。
After four or five days, until February 9, with the help of a friend, Chen Xin lived in a hotel in Fuzhou.
得知这个消息后，他的家人一颗悬着的心才放下。
When he heard the news, his family had a hanging heart.
他说，在宾馆每天早晚各量一次体温，一日三餐都有人送到房间。
He said he took his temperature every morning and evening at the hotel and that three meals a day were taken to his room.
为了不给别人添麻烦，他一直呆在宾馆房间自我隔离，靠看电视或刷手机打发时间。
In order not to cause trouble to others, he has been in hotel room self-isolation, rely on television or brush mobile phones to pass the time.
陈新对澎湃新闻说,他现在身体一切正常，暂时没有被感染新冠肺炎的症状。
Chen told Peng Pai News that he is now in good health and has not been infected with pneumonia.
再过几天，他将再次“出征”，运送第二车福清鳗农们筹集捐赠给武汉一线的医务工作者的爱心烤鳗，“希望在这段时间可以力所能及地多运送一些物资，为抗疫尽一份力。
In a few days, he will make another "expedition" to transport the second truck, Fuqing Eels, to raise the love eels donated to Wuhan frontline medical workers.
”车子再次跑起来谈到运输防疫物资，距离湖北较近的安徽货车司机梁毅（化名）语气中有些不好意思，“我心里也想给疫区贡献一份力量，但我真的不敢拉。
"Turning again to the transport of epidemic prevention materials, Liang Yi (alias), a lorry driver in Anhui province near Hubei, said sheepishly," I also wanted to contribute to the epidemic area, but I really didn't dare.
”梁毅对澎湃新闻解释说，自己并不是怕感染，而是按照家乡规定，一旦和湖北有过接触，返乡就要隔离14天，“我们每个月的车贷都要1万多，还有大人孩子的生活，隔离半个月不出车就顶不住了。
Liang explained to the roaring news that he was not afraid of infection, but in accordance with his hometown regulations, once the contact with Hubei, return home for 14 days, "we need more than 10, 000 a month on car loans, as well as the lives of adults and children, isolated for half a month can not withstand.
”他说，除了湖北以外的防疫物资运输，自己都愿意接单送货，“运费低也接”。
He said he was willing to take delivery orders for epidemic prevention supplies outside Hubei, "with low freight rates."
梁毅和妻子二人长期往返广东和安徽两省。
Liang and his wife traveled to Guangdong and Anhui provinces for a long time.
他告诉澎湃新闻，在初四（1月28日）首次出车时，家乡周边的交通管制还比较严格，“我们县城只留了几个高速口可以上下，当时要去徐州装大蒜，徐州更严格，只留了一个徐州东的高速出口，我们要去的地方在徐州西面，就要绕行一大圈。
"There were only a few high-speed ports left for us to go up and down. We had to go to Xuzhou to load garlic. Xuzhou was more strict, leaving only a high-speed exit for Xuzhou East.
”货车司机们的遭遇，反映了全国防控新冠肺炎疫情的一个侧面，但情况在逐渐改善。
The treatment of truck drivers, which reflects a facet of national efforts to control the outbreak, is improving.
日前，国务院办公厅印发《关于做好公路交通保通保畅工作 确保人员车辆正常通行的通知》（以下简称《通知》），就进一步做好公路交通保通保畅工作，确保人员车辆正常通行，切实维护经济社会正常秩序作出专门部署。
Recently, the General Office of the State Council issued the Notice on Ensuring the Normal Passage of Personnel and Vehicles for the Safeguarding of Highway Traffic (hereinafter referred to as the Notice), and made special arrangements to further improve road traffic safety, ensure the normal passage of people and vehicles, and ensure the normal economic and social order.
通知要求，要全力保障公路路网顺畅运行。
Notice requirements, to ensure the smooth operation of the road network.
各地区、各有关部门要按照“科学有序、依法依规”原则，调整优化公路交通管控措施，严禁擅自封闭高速公路出入口，严禁阻断国省干线公路，严禁硬隔离或挖断农村公路，严禁阻碍应急运输车辆通行，严禁擅自在高速公路服务区和收费站、省界和国省干线公路设置疫情防控检疫点或检测站，已违法违规设置的要坚决撤销。
All areas and departments concerned should adjust and optimize road traffic control measures in accordance with the principle of "scientific and orderly, in accordance with the law," strictly prohibit the unauthorized closure of major highways, block the main highways of the state province, strictly prohibit hard isolation or cut off rural roads, obstruct the passage of emergency transport vehicles, and set up quarantine and inspection stations for epidemic prevention and control.
2月10日，从广东返回安徽时，梁毅已经感觉到交通明显“通畅”很多。
Feb. 10, from Guangdong back to Anhui, Liang Yi had already felt the traffic "smooth" a lot.
“很多高速路口还是有防疫检查站，但体温正常就能通行，已经比之前好很多了。
"Many high-speed junctions still have cordon sanitaire checkpoints, but the body temperature is normal and much better than before.
”但在广东部分村镇，梁毅觉得“《通知》还没被完全贯彻”，依然有部分村镇禁止外地车辆进入，即使手持货单依然被拒绝，而梁毅送货的很多仓库、工厂都在村镇之中。
But in some villages and towns in Guangdong, where Liang felt "the notice has not yet been fully implemented," some towns and villages are still barred from foreign traffic, even though handbills are still denied and many of Liang's warehouses and factories are in villages and towns.
梁毅希望在自己下一趟前往广东送货时，封路的情况能够得到好转。
Liang hoped that when he next to Guangdong delivery, the road closure situation can be improved.
同一天，林刚在卡友群里看到这上述《通知》，“《通知》里说严禁擅自封闭高速公路出入口、严禁阻断国省干线公路，我看到就觉得有希望了。
On the same day, Lin just saw the notice in the Kaya group. "The notice says that it is forbidden to seal off the entrance or exit of the expressway and to block the main highway in Guozhou Province.
”2月11日，在陕西等待“解禁”的林刚等来了货主的装货通知，他的车再次跑了起来，当天下午他就驱车前往货源所在的县城。
On Feb. 11, Lin Gang, who was waiting to be "unblocked" in Shaanxi province, waited for his owner's notification of loading.
在看到临时防疫检测站时，他还有些忐忑，怕再被劝返。
When he saw the temporary cordon sanitaire, he was scared, afraid of being persuaded to return.
但在检测体温正常，并报上装货冷库的名称后，林刚的货车被顺利放行。
But Lin Gang's van was released after the normal temperature was checked and the name of the refrigerated warehouses was given.
当天下午装货后，他就立刻踏上了返回广西的高速。
After loading the goods that afternoon, he immediately set out on the high road back to Guangxi.
但回到广西却不代表着能回到家。
But going back to Guangxi doesn't mean going home.
“我们村里不让外出，出车的时候我是写了保证书的，保证出了车就不能回村，除非等国家宣传疫情结束。
"We didn't want to go out in the village and I made a pledge when I got out that I couldn't go back to the village until the end of the national campaign.
”林刚从19岁开始跑车，已经在外跑了17年，以往总是三五天就回一次家，除了暴雪封路外，这是第一次遇到无法回家的情况。
"Lin, who started his sports car at the age of 19 and has been out running for 17 years, has always returned home in three or five days, the first time he has not been able to go home, except for the Blizzard closure.
他说，自己已经离家多日，打算到村口后住在车里，让家人将换洗衣物和饭菜送过来，“说实话，我自己也不敢见老婆孩子，怕会传染给他们，已经做好三个月不回家的准备了。
He said he had been away for days and planned to stay in the car after the village entrance to have his family bring in laundry and food. "To tell the truth, I didn't dare to see my wife and children myself, for fear of infecting them, and was ready not to return home for three months.
”福建星泰安物流有限公司事长陈礼善介绍，去年同一时期物流园区一天内进出车辆达到八百辆多，但目前进出车辆仅一百辆左右。
Chen Laishan, director of Fujian-based Xingtai Logistics Co., Ltd., said the park had more than 800 vehicles in and out in a day during the same period last year, but only about 100 vehicles were in and out.
“这次疫情对物流公司影响很大，所有厂家都停工，没有货物运输。
"The epidemic has had a great impact on the logistics companies. All the factories have stopped working and there is no cargo transportation.
外省驾驶员没有办法复工。
The provincial driver couldn't get back to work.
目前只有运送生活物资和应急救灾业务，很多是免费运送的。
Currently, only supplies and emergency relief operations are available, many of which are delivered free of charge.
”陈礼善说，大家都期待着疫情尽快结束，恢复正常生活。
"Chen said everyone was looking forward to an end to the epidemic and a return to normal life.
