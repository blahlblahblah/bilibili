记者/魏晓涵编辑/石爱华 宋建华同济医学院法医学系教授刘良1月9日，新冠肺炎出现首个死亡病例，截至2月14日13时，因新冠肺炎所致的死亡人数已达1381人。
Correspondent / Wei Xiaohan Editor / Shi Aihua Song Jianhua Tongji College of Medicine Professor Liu Liang on January 9, the first case of death from Newcrown Pneumonia, as of 13: 00 on Feb. 14, the death toll from Newcap Pneumonia had reached 1,381.
“目前，一例病理解剖都没有”，同济医学院法医学系教授刘良认为，对新冠肺炎死者尸体进行病理解剖，可以为临床治疗和诊断提供有力支持。
"At present, there is no case of pathological anatomy," said Liu Liang, professor of forensic medicine at Tongji Medical School.
刘良从事病理研究三十余年，新冠肺炎疫情爆发后，他所在的团队向湖北省政府提交了紧急报告，强调了尸检的重要性和可行性，并得到了肯定的批复。
After more than 30 years of pathological research, Liu's team submitted an emergency report to the Hubei provincial government, stressing the importance and feasibility of an autopsy, and got a positive response.
现实操作中，武汉市许多个定点医院对病理解剖表达了积极态度，却无法提供解剖场地等支持，刘良分析，由于医院没有收到正式文件，又担心解剖风险，病理解剖的事情只能暂时搁浅。
In practice, many designated hospitals in Wuhan expressed a positive attitude towards pathological anatomy, but were unable to provide support such as anatomy sites. Liu Liang analyzed that because the hospital did not receive official documents and worried about the anatomy risk, the pathological anatomy could only be temporarily stranded.
病理研究为什么如此重要？为什么在新冠肺炎死亡病例出现一个多月后，研究无法开展？已有的冠状病毒病理研究对这次疫情有何作用？针对以上问题，深一度对话了刘良。
Why is pathology so important? Why can't the study be carried out more than a month after the death of Coronavirus? What is the role of the existing coronavirus pathology in this outbreak?
新冠肺炎患者的CT影像图，肺部出现毛玻璃样病理搞不清楚，治疗就会盲目深一度：在新冠肺炎的诊疗中，病理检查的现状怎样？刘良：病理上没有完整的、系统的东西，可能有个别人做了穿刺或者活检，但都是很局限的，它不能代表整体，基本上是空白。
The CT image of the patient with Newly Coronary Pneumonia shows that if there is a glasslike pathology in the lungs, the treatment is blind for a degree: What is the status of the pathologic examination in the diagnosis and treatment of new crown pneumonia? Liu Liang: Pathologically there is no complete, systematic thing.
现在死亡人数过千，（这种缺失）按理说是不应该的。
The death toll is now in the thousands, and should not have been.
深一度：病理学检查为何重要？刘良：打个比方，CT检查就像卫星，如果地球上发生了一场战争，卫星只能看个大概。
Why is a pathologic examination important? Liu Liang: For example, CT examination is like a satellite. If there is a war on earth, the satellite can only look around.
最核心的是要有人到前沿阵地去，看见敌人死了多少，我们的防御出了什么问题？敌人用什么武器，我们武器是什么样子？像侦察兵一样，指导后方打仗。
At the heart of the matter is the question of how many dead the enemy is, what is wrong with our defenses, what weapons the enemy uses, what are our weapons like scouts, and direct the war behind us.
病理研究就干这事儿。
That's what the pathology is doing.
CT显示，（新冠肺炎患者）肺上出现毛玻璃样。
The CT revealed that there was a glassy appearance in the lungs.
我们要搞清楚是什么导致肺出现毛玻璃样，是水肿？出血？感染？纤维化？里面起反应的是中性白细胞、单核细胞还是淋巴细胞？搞不清楚的话，治疗上就会盲目，一片乱杀。
We need to know what causes the lungs to appear, is it oedema? Hemorrhage? Infection? Fibrosis? Neutrophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes? If not, the treatment will be blind, indiscriminate killing.
病理研究也关注传染途径的问题。
Pathological studies also focus on the route of transmission.
比如粪口传染，肠道里的病毒到底分布在什么地方？口腔、食道、胃、十二指肠还是结肠？不同情况的病人治疗也完全不一样。
For example, where does fecal infection occur and where does the virus in the intestine reside? Oral, esophageal, stomach, duodenum, or colon? Patients with different conditions are treated differently.
以后，如果要对新冠肺炎做实验，设计研究模型，也需要病理研究的结果。
In the future, if we want to test the new crown pneumonia, design the research model, also need the results of pathologic study.
深一度：如果可以，新冠肺炎的病理研究可以做到什么程度？刘良：我们需要对新冠肺炎的死者遗体进行解剖，取样，然后做切片，可以研究病毒在人体的分布状态，以及身体哪个部位对病毒有反应。
At one degree: If so, how far can pathologic studies of new crown pneumonia take place? Liu Liang: We need to dissect, sample and slice the bodies of people who have died of New Crown Pneumonia, so we can study the distribution of the virus in the body and which parts of the body respond to it.
具体到病毒对哪个组织、哪个器官，器官的哪个局部、哪些细胞损害更多。
Specific to which tissues, which organs, which parts of the organ, which cells damage more.
病毒攻击的方向、靶点在哪里，我们就要对这个靶点做研究，做一些干预、防御。
The direction of the virus attack, where the target is, we have to do research on this target, do some intervention, defense.
（这个缺失）对抢救治疗有延误，对将来的研究也有影响，所以很着急。
There have been delays in rescue treatment and future research, so there is a great deal of anxiety.
深一度：病理研究能为新冠肺炎的治疗提供什么支持？刘良：肯定能提供支持。
Deep One: What support can pathologic studies provide for the treatment of Newly Coronary Pneumonia? Liu Liang: Certainly.
以往，有很多临床不清楚的问题，都能在病理医生的解剖结果中找到答案，像判官一样。
In the past, there were many clinically unclear questions that could be answered by a pathologist's autopsy, like a judge.
新冠病毒很奇怪，远离气管，在肺的周围比较多。
The new crown virus is strange, away from the trachea, and more around the lungs.
所以取咽拭子的时候，病人要深深的把肺周围的病毒咳出来。
So when taking swabs, the patient has to cough up the virus around his lungs.
为什么是这样的？目前还不知道。
Why is this so? It is not known yet.
我们需要在显微镜下去验证，肺的哪个部位病变更明显，是靠近中间，还是外围？具体是什么样的病变，哪一块的炎性细胞比较多？有了这些病理研究，就会去思考，“为什么病毒会到这个地方去？”假设病毒在肺的外围多，那么它可能不是从呼吸道传入的，而是从消化道进入，跟着血液循环到边缘的毛细血管，然后繁殖，从外向内对肺部进行攻击。
We need to look under a microscope to see which part of the lung is more pronounced, close to the center or the periphery? What specific lesions are there and which inflammatory cells are more numerous?
如果是这样，可能需要处理的就是血液上的问题，而不仅是针对肺的雾化，治疗的重点和方向就不一样了。
If so, it may be blood problems that need to be addressed, not just nebulization of the lungs, and the focus and direction of treatment will be different.
另外，这个病毒对不同的人作用不一样，病例积累得越多，对临床治疗越有用。
In addition, the virus works differently for different people, and the more cases accumulate, the more useful it is for clinical treatment.
如果有病理解剖的知识，会更方便。
It would be more convenient if you had knowledge of pathology.
北京地坛医院建有生物安全保护Ⅲ级(BSL3)尸体解剖实验室, 曾对SARS死亡病例进行病理解剖和发病机制研究达标解剖室很少，但不是没办法深一度：新冠肺炎死亡病例的病理解剖，现状如何？刘良：目前，针对新冠肺炎的病理解剖一例都没有。
Beijing Ditan Hospital has a BSL3 autopsy laboratory, few, but not impossible, anatomy rooms have been set up to study the pathologic anatomy and pathogenesis of SARS death.
据我所知（武汉这边）只有我们的团队在跟进，我们有一组人，其中做法医鉴定的人比较多。
As far as I know (Wuhan side) only our team in the follow-up, we have a group of people, one of the more forensic experts.
对传染病人遗体的解剖，防止病毒传播，国内有一套标准。
There is a set of domestic standards for the autopsy of the remains of infected persons to prevent the spread of the virus.
目前国内达到传染病解剖标准的解剖室很少，北京地坛医院有一家，曾用于SARS研究，其他地方都没有，我们不可能把遗体从武汉运到北京。
At present, there are few anatomical rooms in China that meet the anatomical standards for infectious diseases. There is one in Beijing Ditan Hospital, which was used for SARS research.
但不能说没有就不做，还是要想办法。
But don't say no, don't do, still think of a way.
我们以前做过非典、艾滋病（传染性疾病）的解剖，没有很好的解剖环境，也没有发生过什么问题。
We have done SARS, AIDS (infectious diseases) anatomy before, no good anatomical environment, no problems have occurred.
深一度：没有标准的传染病解剖室，要在哪里进行？刘良：这是一种特殊的解剖模式，需要在一个小的（空间）进行，比如尸体袋。
Once in a while: There is no standard room for the anatomy of infectious diseases, where? Liu Liang: This is a special anatomy model that needs to be performed in a small (space), such as a cadaver bag.
（解剖完的遗体）缝合好，袋子拉上去就可以了，技术上不是问题，可以在医院就地做。
After the autopsy, the body is sewn up and the bag is pulled up. Technically, it is not a problem and can be done locally in the hospital.
空地、室外都可以做，或者一个杂物间、一个角落里面都可以，做完进行消杀，安全性上没什么问题。
Open space, outdoor can do, or a clutter room, a corner inside can be done to kill, safety is no problem.
深一度：病人身上携带的病毒会不会二次污染或扩散？刘良：说起来，新冠肺炎传染性强，好像挺可怕。
At one degree: Will the virus carried by the patient cause secondary contamination or spread? Liu Liang: Speaking, the new crown pneumonia is very infectious, it seems to be terrible.
普通人、包括很多专业人士都不懂，觉得太危险。
Ordinary people, including many professionals, do not understand it and find it too dangerous.
但是我们之前做了很多（其他传染病人的病理解剖），从没发生过人员感染，也没造成环境污染。
But we've done a lot before (pathology of other infectious diseases), there's never been a human infection and there's no environmental pollution.
做过的人知道怎么防护。
People who have done it know how to protect themselves.
比如在尸体袋里面做解剖，之后直接火化，没有太大问题。
Like doing an autopsy inside a cadaver bag and then cremating it directly, without much problem.
深一度：国内外有可供借鉴的经验吗？刘良：国外对（传染疾病）解剖和尸检比较积极。
Once upon a time: Is there any experience at home and abroad that can be used for reference? Liu Liang: Anatomy and autopsy abroad are more active.
其实，在非典时期，国内出现死亡病例十几天后，就开始做病理解剖了。
In fact, in the SARS period, the death cases occurred in the country a few days later, began to do pathologic autopsy.
实际上，我们可以把非典的模式重复一下。
In fact, we can repeat the SARS model.
当时的解剖防护措施就很普通，现在的防护比以前更好。
Anatomical protection was common at the time, and it is now better protected than before.
最近，有做过非典病人尸体解剖的人给我留言，他们觉得没什么可怕的。
Recently, someone who had performed an autopsy on a SARS patient left a message for me that they didn't think it was terrible.
深一度：相比非典，新冠肺炎的病理解剖有什么不同？刘良：这次需要更细一些，主要是防止次生灾害。
Deep One: What is the difference between the pathological anatomy of SARS and that of SARS? Liu Liang: It needs to be finer this time, mainly to prevent secondary disasters.
操作上需要更稳，更慢。
More stable and slower operation is needed.
比如，可以在一个更小的空间里操作。
For example, you can operate in a smaller space.
要准备很多毛巾吸掉血水，袋子要防水，确保血水不会流到土壤里，或排到下水道，不让粉尘漏在外面。
Prepare plenty of towels to suck up blood, which should be waterproof, to make sure the blood doesn't run into the soil or drain to keep the dust out.
对于实施解剖的人，要穿好防护服。
For those who perform the autopsy, wear protective clothing.
相比普通医护人员我们防护措施更严格。
Our protective measures are more stringent than those of the general medical staff.
比如，医护人员戴两层手套，我们戴三层，口罩也更多一点。
For example, paramedics wear two gloves, we wear three layers, and we wear a little more masks.
在操作上，我们列了程序，有很多讲究，比普通尸检更严谨，为了避免操作层面出现遗漏，有专人在旁边进行操作步骤的提示，做一步，打一个勾，做缝合时，以前是不同部位同时进行，现在要每个部位单独进行。
In operation, we have listed the procedures, there are many more fastidious than ordinary autopsy, in order to avoid omissions at the operational level, there are instructions on the side of the operation, do a step, hit a hook, do stitching, was previously carried out simultaneously in different parts, now each site should be carried out separately.
深一度：为新冠肺炎病例解剖，您的团队做了哪些准备？刘良：我们在1月23日就做好了预案，包括谁上，谁在外面，做完了以后要自我隔离等等，也做过模拟，像演习一样。
At one degree: What did your team do to prepare for the autopsy of the new crown pneumonia case? Liu Liang: We made a plan on January 23rd, including who went up, who was outside, who was going to isolate himself after doing it, and so on, did some simulations, like exercises.
我们以前的规定是老同志、党员先上，但这次考虑到新冠病毒“欺负”老同志，所以安排老同志进场指挥，中青年骨干上解剖台，都是很有经验的人。
Our previous regulations were that old comrades and Party members should go first, but this time, considering the old comrade bullied by the new crown virus, we arranged for the veteran comrades to enter the scene to conduct the dissection of the cadres of young and middle-aged men.
武汉抗疫一线的医生正在对CT结果进行诊断没有正式文件，病理解剖落地难深一度：在我国做病理解剖，有什么要求？刘良：从法律来讲，我国《传染病防治法》里面提到，病患尸体可以来做病理解剖。
Wuhan anti-epidemic first-line doctors are on the diagnosis of CT results no official documents, pathologic autopsy landing difficult once: What is the requirements for doing a pathological autopsy in our country? Liu Liang: Legally speaking, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases mentions that the patient's body can be examined by pathology.
前提要通过家属同意，解剖之后，要做好环境的防护、个人的防护。
Prerequisites should be through the consent of the family, after the autopsy, to do a good job of environmental protection, personal protection.
（这个过程）过五关斩六将，层层都需把关。
There are many layers of security to guard against.
首先需要死者家属的同意，签一个协议告知；第二需要有一个相对合适的场地，不让病毒扩散，有人提出需要在负压（空间）下操作，但解剖需要的防护、防止次生灾害的措施我们都有，不需要担心；第三是做尸检人员要有资质。
First, with the consent of the family of the deceased, an agreement must be signed; secondly, there must be a relatively suitable site to prevent the virus from spreading; secondly, the need to operate under negative pressure (space), but the anatomy needs protection, measures to prevent secondary disasters we all have, do not need to worry; third, the post-mortem personnel must be qualified.
深一度：其实《传染病防治法》里提到，做传染病的病理解剖，可以不征得家属同意？刘良：是可以。
One degree: Actually, according to the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the pathological autopsy of an infectious disease can be done without the consent of the family?
但我们从人性化角度出发，征得家属同意，这是对死者和家属的尊重。
But from a human perspective and with the consent of our families, this is respect for the dead and their families.
就目前状况来说，讲清楚道理，大多数患者家属都是愿意的，这是个意义重大的事情。
As things stand, it makes sense that most of the patients' families are willing to do so, and that's a big deal.
深一度：既然次生危害能有效预防，为什么目前还没有对新冠肺炎死亡病例进行解剖尸检？刘良：1月24日我们给湖北省政府写了一个紧急报告，强调了尸检的重要性和可行性。
At one degree: Since secondary hazards can be effectively prevented, why hasn't an autopsy been performed on the death toll from Newly Coronary Pneumonia? Liu Liang: On January 24, we wrote an urgent report to the government of Hubei Province, emphasizing the importance and feasibility of the autopsy.
29号收到省里批复，意思是可以做，但没有作为文件向下传达。
No. 29 received provincial approval, meaning that it could be done, but was not sent down as a document.
后来我们去联系各个医院，所有医生都说这个好，但涉及到具体方案的时候，医院就要请示、汇报、要文件、批文。
Then we went to the hospitals and all the doctors said it was good, but when it came to the specific plan, the hospital had to ask for instructions, reports, requests for documents and approvals.
现在，可能省、市的医院没接到正式下达的文件，在观望等待，暂时没有启动这个事情。
Now, perhaps the provincial and municipal hospitals have not received the official documents, waiting to wait, temporarily did not start this matter.
现在这个局面，我也是万般无奈，具体怎么做，没有方向。
Now this situation, I am also helpless, specific how to do, there is no direction.
深一度：医院的顾虑是什么？刘良：医院对于解剖场地有所顾虑。
Once upon a time: What are the hospital's concerns? Liu Liang: The hospital has concerns about the anatomy site.
医院态度很好，也很热情，但涉及解剖场地时，医院通常回复说：“第一没地方，没房间解剖，第二是没有正式的政府文件用来执行”。
Hospitals have a good attitude and enthusiasm, but when it comes to dissecting sites, they often reply, "No place to go, no room to dissect, and no official government documents to execute."
我给医院看过政府的批复，但医院要正式文件。
I showed the hospital the government's approval, but the hospital needed official documents.
（单凭）一个批复，没人敢负责，问题的症结可能在这个地方。
No one is responsible for a reply. The crux of the matter may lie in this place.
深一度：除了在医院就地做病理解剖，还有其他的选择吗？刘良：我们觉得把尸体运到武汉其他解剖间，不够负压标准，过程中造成的污染可能更厉害。
Liu Liang: We think the transportation of the body to other anatomy rooms in Wuhan is not up to the negative pressure standard and the pollution may be worse.
也可以到殡仪馆做，但又会涉及到民政等其他部门，还有遗体运输工的安全问题，环节越多就更麻烦。
Can also do to the funeral parlour, but will involve civil affairs and other departments, as well as the body transport workers security issues, more links are more troublesome.
深一度：病理解剖的对象，有一定的选择标准吗？刘良：我们会考虑他临床上的经过，比如生前有无其他疾病，像心脏病、高血压、糖尿病等等，这些在他的死因中起到什么作用。
We will take into account his clinical history, such as whether there were any other diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc., which played a role in his death.
最重点还是研究肺，这个病毒对于人的呼吸功能干扰很大，影响肺的氧气交换过程，是重点要研究的东西。
The most important is the study of lung, this virus to human respiratory function interference, affect the oxygen exchange process of lung, is the focus of research.
深一度：完成一例病理研究，需要花费多长时间？刘良：一般的尸检，要二三十天出结果。
How long does it take to complete a pathologic study? Liu Liang: A normal autopsy takes 20 or 30 days to produce results.
但新冠肺炎是很着急的，不只一种（人体组织切片）染色要上，各种都要用到，这样提取的信息更多，对临床指导意义更大。
But the new crown pneumonia is very anxious, more than one (human tissue section) dyeing, a variety of needs to be used, so that more information extracted, more clinical guidance.
如果能做，快一点，特事特办，九、十天就能出结果。
If you can do it, hurry up, special agent, nine or ten days to produce results.
深一度：之前对冠状病毒患者的病理研究，比如SARS，或者中东呼吸综合征，积累下来的经验可以用于新冠病毒的治疗吗？刘良：说不清楚。
Deep One: Can the accumulated experience from previous pathologic studies of coronavirus patients, such as SARS or the Middle East respiratory syndrome, be applied to the treatment of the coronavirus? Liu Liang: Not clear.
我们到现在不知道肺炎的病变是怎样的，和原来的有什么异同。
We still do not know what the pathological changes of pneumonia are, and how the original similarities and differences.
这个预测不了。
That's not gonna happen.
深一度：现在还在做什么努力？刘良：我现在还在走官方途径，很多朋友在跟不同的国家机构和部门联系，反映这件事。
Once upon a time, what efforts are being made? Liu Liang: I am still going through the official channels, and many friends are contacting different state agencies and departments to report on this matter.
我觉得（病理解剖）终归要做的，早一点至少可以多救几个人吧。
I think (pathology anatomy) must be done after all, at least a few people can be saved earlier.
