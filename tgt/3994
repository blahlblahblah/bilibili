春天里的网吧静悄悄。
The net bar is quiet in spring.
从业者们正等待着开门的那一天。
Practitioners are waiting for the day when the door opens.

新的一天开始了，小鹿戴上口罩，朝着网吧的方向走去。
The new day began, the deer put on a mask, toward the direction of Internet cafes.
。
.
在疫情影响到连云港前，小鹿打算利用一部分寒假时间做兼职，小区里的网吧离得近，成了她的最佳选择。
Before the outbreak affected Lianyungang, the deer planned to use part of her winter vacation time to do part-time, the neighborhood Internet cafes close, has become her best choice.
这不是个辛苦的差事，小鹿每天下午1点打卡上班，晚上9点准时离开，用她自己的话来说，工作内容并不复杂，“就是日常打卡上班，做个刷身份证的网管”。
It wasn't a hard job. The fawn clicks in at 1 p.m. and leaves at 9 p.m. punctually. In her own words, the job isn't complicated.
。
.
在许多城市里，网吧都是常年运转、永远不缺人光顾的地方。
In many cities, the net bar is the place which the year round runs, never lacks the human patronage.
它同时具有联结与隔绝的双重功效：有人把它当做最合适的聚会场所，无论是线下聚会还是线上的朋友联机，它是联结世界的桥梁；有人把它当做避难所，在其中耗费无数时光，享受与世界隔绝的快乐……。
It has the dual function of connectivity and isolation: it is seen as the most appropriate meeting place, whether offline or online, it is the bridge that connects the world; it is used as a refuge, where people spend countless hours enjoying the joy of being cut off from the world...
但在这个春天，所有网吧里都静悄悄。
But in this spring, all the Internet cafes are quiet.
。
.
■ 留在二楼的萨摩耶。
▪ Samoa, which remains on the second floor.
小鹿从没想过，这份清闲的工作很快就会结束。
It never occurred to the fawn that the slack job would soon be over.
新冠肺炎的消息越来越多，前来网吧的客人越来越少。
More and more news of the new crown pneumonia, less and less visitors to the Internet bar.
1月24日，网吧正式收到停业通知，那天，整个网吧里就只剩下两位顾客。
January 24, the Internet cafes officially received notice of closure, that day, the entire Internet cafes only two customers.
“那能怎么办，还是命重要。
"It matters what you do, or your life.
”小鹿很无奈，但能理解停业的要求。
"The fawn was helpless, but understood the demands of the closure.
。
.
“只是可怜了老板的狗子。
"Just pity the boss's dog.
”。
"
小鹿接到了通知。
The fawn was notified.
在网吧二层的小屋里，小鹿的老板养了一条萨摩耶。
In the small house on the second floor of the Internet cafe, the owner of the fawn keeps a Samoan.
在正常营业的日子里，这条狗是老板的心头肉，就算老板出门办事，也要将它托付给保洁阿姨，确保每天都能出门溜上一两个小时。
On normal business days, the dog is the boss's chore. If the boss goes out on errands, he entrusts it to his aunt cleaner to make sure he can walk out for an hour or two every day.
突如其来的疫情显然不在老板的计划之内，停业以后，保洁阿姨不再上班，老板也因故无暇去照看，萨摩耶的吃喝拉撒便交给了在网吧附近居住的员工照料。
The sudden outbreak apparently wasn't part of the boss's plan. After the shutdown, Aunt Procter stopped working and the boss had no time to look after him. Samoan food and drink were handed over to employees who lived near the cafe.
。
.
每天，小鹿都会和同事们在微信群里协商，确定谁去添水添粮。
Every day, the deer and their colleagues in the micro-letter group to determine who to add water and food.
萨摩耶平日最喜欢的外出的环节不复存在了，虽然这条狗表现乖巧，不会拽着人到处跑，但出于安全考虑，谁都不愿意在室外待太久。
The Samoyed Dog's favorite outings are gone, and although the dog is adept at not dragging people around, no one wants to spend much time outdoors for safety reasons.
。
.
萨摩耶这种大型犬，没法出门自然像是关禁闭。
Big dogs like Samoyed can't go out of doors like cages.
每天中午，小鹿打开网吧里的狗笼，它便摇着尾巴冲出来，围着小鹿的腿转圈撒娇，一旦小鹿忙完手头的事，准备离开，它又会追在小鹿身后，摆出一副可怜巴巴的样子，这总是让小鹿于心不忍。
Each day at noon, the fawn opens the dog cage in the net bar. It wags its tail and runs around the deer's legs. When the fawn is busy with the work at hand and ready to leave, it will chase after the fawn and put on a pathetic appearance.
。
.
萨摩耶正靠在小鹿脚上。
Samoa is leaning against the feet of the fawn.
小鹿并不担心网吧停摆会造成多大的损失。
The deer did not worry about how much damage it would cause if the Internet cafes stopped.
平日里接触下来，她觉得老板家大业大，停业一段时间应该还可以承受，她只是发自内心地担心这条萨摩耶的身心健康。
During her usual contact, she felt that the boss's family business, a period of suspension should be affordable, she just from the bottom of her heart worried about the Samoan physical and mental health.
。
.
■ “对我来说，有社保就够了”。
▪ For me, social security is enough.
并非每个人都像小鹿那样乐观。
Not everyone is as optimistic as a fawn.
实际上，越是了解网吧行业的人，越是知道停业的每一天意味着什么，这种痛苦有时不光由老板承担，也让那些热爱自己工作的员工有所触动。
In fact, the more you know about the Internet cafes industry and what it means to go out of business each day, the pain is sometimes felt not only by the boss, but also by the employees who love their jobs.
。
.
刘熊今年33岁。
Liu Xiong is 33 years old.
出于平日里对游戏的热爱，再加上看好电竞行业，几年前他加入了由好友蒋明明组建的团队，在北京某家电竞馆负责场馆运营。
Because of his love for games and his love for the Atletico industry, he joined a team set up by his friend Jiang Mingming a few years ago to run the stadium at a Beijing appliance competition.
。
.
这不是一份轻松的工作。
This is not an easy job.
在电竞馆里，刘熊主要负责场馆运营和职业战队接待，有时还要兼顾对外项目和活动推广，人手紧张时，财务、人事和新媒体刘熊也要参与。
In Atletico, Liu is mainly responsible for the operation of the venues and the reception of the TechnoFrontier, and sometimes also for the promotion of external projects and activities.
繁杂又多样的工作让刘熊的休息时间难以确保，电竞馆24小时营业，节假日无休。
Complex and diverse work so that Liu Xiong rest time is difficult to ensure that the 24-hour race hall, holidays no rest.
在没有特殊活动的日子里，刘熊也经常被网约车拉着在两家门店之间往返，下班到家时通常已经深夜。
On days when there are no special events, Liu is often pulled back and forth between the two stores, usually in the middle of the night after work.
。
.
刘熊热爱自己的工作。
Liu Xiong loves his job.
网吧和电竞馆有什么区别？刘熊用游戏版本号来举例。
What is the difference between Internet cafes and TV galleries? Liu Xiong uses game version number as an example.
“比如网吧是1.0，电竞馆可能是2.0、3.0，或者3.0 Plus，也可以是红白机和VR游戏的区别。
"For example, Internet cafes are 1.0, and electronic galleries can be 2.0, 3.0 or 3.0 Plus, or the difference between a red and white machine and a VR game.
网吧只能满足玩家最基本的玩电脑的需求，电竞馆就不一样了，它能打游戏，能训练，还可以举办活动和拍摄，是一个比较立体的活动场所。
Cyber cafes can only meet the player's most basic computer needs, the electric competition hall is not the same, it can play games, training, can hold activities and shooting, is a relatively three-dimensional activity.
”。
"
刘熊所在的电竞馆提供的线下观赛活动。
Liu Xiong's electric pavilion offers off-line observation activities.
刘熊也乐于和顾客接触，有人问，有哪些《英雄联盟》队伍来过电竞馆里练习，他连着说了许多个名字。
Liu was also happy to meet customers and was asked which Hero Alliance teams had come to practice at Atletico, and he kept saying many names.
出于保密要求，他不能透露那些明星选手们在训练时的表现。
He couldn't disclose how the stars performed in training because of confidentiality requirements.
“可是他们还挺有意思的，就是包括线下对工作人员和粉丝，都很友好。
"But they were also interesting, including offline friendliness for staff and fans.
”。
"
就像是喧嚣都市里插电即可营业的“有求必应屋”，电竞馆提供的娱乐内容是丰富多样的。
Like the bustle of the city plug-in can be open to the "demand should be the house," the content of entertainment provided by the museum is rich and diverse.
有人借助场地办年会，就可以抢红包和玩桌游；有聚会请求时，也能出现穿着女仆装的服务员和烤翅。
People can grab red packets and play table games with the help of an annual meeting at the venue, and maid-attired waitresses and grilled wings can be found when parties request.
当然，还有队伍训练、集体观赛，或者单纯地当做网吧营业......如果不是疫情，刘熊此时应该也在忙碌于准备这些活动，但这个春天，刘熊只能待在家里，家庭聚会全部取消，店里又没有事情需要他频繁往返，看看纪录片、小说，刷刷微博，偶尔玩会游戏成了他的主要日常。
Of course, there are team training, group watching, or simply running as an Internet cafe... If it hadn't been for the outbreak, Liu would have been busy preparing for these activities, but this spring, Liu Xiong would have stayed at home, his family gatherings were cancelled, there was nothing for him to commute frequently, watching documentaries, novels, brushing microblogs, and occasional games became his main daily routine.
。
.
电竞馆里摆着许多手办。
Atletico has many hands on it.
生在北京的年轻人，大都保留着一些17年前非典型肺炎的记忆。
Most of the young people born in Beijing have some memories of SARS 17 years ago.
非典那年，蒋明明正面临高考，刘熊在专心读书，虽然学校停课了，他们却并不感觉疫情有多严重。
In SARS that year, Jiang was facing college entrance examination, Liu Xiong was absorbed in reading, although the school closed, they did not feel how serious the epidemic is.
在他俩印象里，戴口罩的人并不多，蒋明明甚至还会抽时间在外面打篮球。
They had the impression that not many people wore masks, and Jiang apparently even found time to play basketball outside.
。
.
但在那一年，娱乐场所的确是关闭了。
But in that year, the entertainment venues were closed.
刘熊有预感，这次疫情会引起同样的连锁反应，只是他没想到会这么快、时间持续这么久。
Liu Xiong has a hunch that this outbreak will cause the same chain reaction, but he did not expect it to be so fast, so long.
电竞馆刚歇业时，他只当是提前放两天假，自己隔几天还回去检查一下门窗，做做收尾工作。
When the TV competition just closed, he should only take two days' leave ahead of schedule. He went back every few days to check the doors and windows and finish the work.
随着歇业时间超过预期，他开始觉得这次的疫情没有两三个月过不去。
As the shutdown outlasted expectations, he began to feel there was no more than two or three months to go through the epidemic.
。
.
在北京，一家网吧大门上贴着的停业通告已经褪色。
In Beijing, a closure notice posted at the gate of an internet cafe has faded.
长时间、没有截止日期的歇业难免引起员工之间的讨论。
A long, open-ended shutdown inevitably leads to discussions among employees.
在刘熊的工作群里，同事们偶尔会聊到对工资的担忧，刘熊的态度倒是比较坦然。
In Liu's work group, colleagues occasionally talk about concerns about wages, Liu Xiong's attitude is relatively calm.
他说，不担心收入肯定是假话，但他觉得作为公司的一份子，也要尽可能在困境里分担一些什么，自己少拿一点，如果对电竞馆经营下去有帮助，那也值得。
'Not worrying about your income is definitely not true, 'he says.' But he feels as if being part of the company needs to share as much of the pain as possible and take less of it himself, which is worth it if it helps the pavilion to operate.
。
.
“对我来说，有社保就够了，支持公司。
"Social security is enough for me to support the company.
”。
"
这段时间，刘熊并没有考虑过换工作。
During this time, Liu Xiong did not consider changing jobs.
一部分原因当然是他和老板蒋明明关系好，想陪这位朋友共渡难关，至于要陪多久，他说就算再停3个月也没关系。
Part of the reason, of course, was that he and his boss, Jiang Ming-ming, wanted to stay with him during the hard time.
。
.
■ “我就一句话，工资照发”。
I will pay you one line according to my salary.
小张，23岁，在海宁拥有一家自己的网吧。
Xiao Zhang, 23, owns an internet cafe of his own in Haining.
小张坚持把自己的店称为“网咖”，因为他觉得他的“网咖”和人们印象里的网吧不一样。
Zhang insists his store is "cyber cafe" because he thinks his "cyber cafe" is different from what people think of it.
。
.
特殊时期应该如何安抚员工情绪，小张的回答十分直白：“我就一句话，工资照发，大家好好休息，开门了以后有得忙的。
"Zhang answered very bluntly," I'll take one sentence, the salary will be paid, we'll have a good rest and we'll be busy when we open the door.
”。
"
小张知道，稳定员工情绪最好的办法就是保障经济来源，他能做的只有如此。
Zhang knows that the best way to stabilize an employee's mood is to secure his financial resources. That's all he can do.
这是个艰难的承诺。
This is a difficult commitment.
小张自己算过一笔账，停业至今，把预计盈利和设备折旧费加在一起，网咖一个月大概蒙受6万元的损失。
Xiao Zhang has made an account himself and has closed down his business, adding up the estimated profit with the depreciation of the equipment, causing a loss of about 60,000 yuan a month.
现金流能让网咖支撑多久？他的回答是“只能到月底了”。
How long can cash flow keep the internet cafe afloat? His answer is "only at the end of the month."
。
.
小张说的是2月底。
Xiao Zhang said at the end of February.
。
.
网咖老板并不是小张的唯一身份。
Cybercafe owners are not the only ones Zhang has.
正式投身这一行业前，他在当地有份主业，但手里现钱不多。
Before joining the business, he had a major local career, but he had little cash in his hand.
为了弥补现金流支出，他决定选个自己喜欢的副业，做网咖正好满足这两点条件。
To make up for his cash flow, he decided to choose a sideline he liked, and he met both of these conditions.
。
.
2019年5月，小张的网咖正式开业，生意的火爆程度超出了他的想象。
In May 2019, Xiao Zhang's Internet cafe officially opened, with more business than he had expected.
即便自家附近已经有6个竞争者，小张仍旧不会为客流担心。
Even with six competitors already in the neighborhood, Mr Zhang will not worry about the crowds.
相反，还没营业多久，他就要增添机位，应付在门口排队的顾客。
On the contrary, before it was too long, he had to add seats to meet the queues at the door.
。
.
小张的网咖地段很好。
Xiao Zhang's net coffee area is very good.
网咖位于海宁开发区，背靠规模相当大的工业区和小区，又临近公交车站，超市、夜宵、外卖等“配套设置”一应俱全，如果不火，一定是自己经营时犯了大错。
Situated in the Haining Development Zone, with its back to a sizeable industrial area and small area, and close to the bus station, the supermarket, midnight snack, take-out and other "matching settings," if not fire, must have made a big mistake while operating.
。
.
小张的网咖。
Xiao Zhang's net coffee.
把做网咖当做副业，让小张和他的朋友们享受了一些额外的“福利”。
Making Internet cafes a sideline gives Xiao Zhang and his friends some extra "benefits."
。
.
大概13岁时，小张就开始跟同学出没在黑网吧里，《英雄联盟》和《QQ三国》是他热衷的游戏，尤其是前者。
When he was about 13, Xiao Zhang began to hang out with his classmates in the black Internet cafes. "Hero League" and "QQ Three Kingdoms" are his favourite games, especially the former.
一直到现在，小张身边绝大多数朋友都是《英雄联盟》爱好者，这里面既有开公司的，也有继承家族生意的。
Up to now, most of Xiao Zhang's friends are fans of "Hero Alliance," which includes both company and family business.
平日聚会时，游戏是维系他们友情的重要活动。
On weekdays, games are an important part of maintaining their friendship.
得知小张开网咖后，不少朋友都来捧场，很多人一来二去就成了店里的常客。
After learning small open net curry, a lot of friends came to praise, a lot of people to become a regular customer in the shop.
。
.
熟人太多也不全是好事，为了避免见面时要求打折和送饮料，除了每天一次来店里对账，顺便了解有哪些服务需要升级改进，小张很少在店里停留。
It's not all good to have too many acquaintances. To avoid having to ask for discounts and drinks, Zhang rarely stops at the store except once a day to check in and find out which services need to be upgraded.
。
.
小张为这个春节的业绩做过预估。
Xiao Zhang made a forecast for the performance of the Spring Festival.
海宁属于工业区，主要消费群体都是外来务工人员，春节期间的人流量相对平时要少很多，因此店里也不用留太多人。
Haining is an industrial area, the main consumer groups are migrant workers, during the Spring Festival relatively less traffic, so the store does not have to leave too many people.
如果有员工选择留下，他会相应加工资，如果人手实在不够，他会自己看店。
If an employee chooses to stay, he will increase his salary accordingly. If he is understaffed, he will look after the shop himself.
。
.
但一切来得太过突然。
But it came all too suddenly.
刚注意到疫情新闻时，小张并没放在心上。
When he first noticed the news about the epidemic, Xiao Zhang paid no attention to it.
海宁和武汉相隔700多公里，似乎已经足够安全，前来消费的顾客想法也类似。
Haining and Wuhan are more than 700 kilometers apart, and seem to be safe enough to come to consumers with similar ideas.
小张回忆说，疫情刚开始时，大多数顾客还是照常来上网，更没人想到要戴口罩。
'At the beginning of the epidemic, most customers still came to the Internet as usual, 'Mr. Zhang recalls,' and no one thought of wearing masks.
。
.
1月22日，当地文化部门下达了停业通知，第二天，还没来得及准备资金、安排人员，小张的网咖就正式停业了。
On 22 January, the local cultural authorities issued a notice of closure, and the following day, before funds could be prepared and personnel arranged, Xiao Zhang's net curry was officially suspended.
通知要求所有人员撤出营业场所，小张安排员工简单地打扫了卫生，用酒精消毒了全场，然后就关门了。
The notice required all personnel to vacate the premises. Xiao Zhang arranged for the staff to clean up simply, disinfect the room with alcohol, and then closed the door.
房租和收入上肯定要亏了，虽然这样想着，但小张愿意去配合。
There must be a loss in rent and income, but with that in mind, Xiao Zhang was willing to go along.
。
.
“也是没有办法的事。
There is no other way.
”带着一脑门子的头疼和担忧，小张开始了停业后的生活。
With a headache and worry about his forehead, Xiao Zhang went out of business.
平日里小张就自由散漫，这段时间更是常常一觉睡到中午，然后看书、运动、打游戏。
On weekdays Xiao Zhang is free to ramble, this time is often a sleep until noon, then read a book, sports, play games.
远离忙碌和朋友聚会仍旧让他感到不自在。
Staying away from his busyness and friends' parties still made him uncomfortable.
大年三十那天，小张一个人走进自家网咖，打算借着店里的机子体验一下《英雄联盟》的“无限火力”模式，结果没玩多久，就被执法人员劝回家了。
On New Year's Eve, Xiao Zhang walked into his net cafe and tried to experience the "unlimited firepower" mode of Hero Alliance by using the machine in the shop.
。
.
全国网吧的联网系统是有相关部门监测的，疫情期间私自联网，很快就会有人找上门。
The network system of Internet cafes in China is monitored by relevant departments. During the epidemic period, people will come to the Internet.
面对疫情，小张所在的社区严格应对，疫情严重时出入都要受限，一直到最近逐渐开放，他才有机会去店里通风消毒、调试设备。
In the face of the outbreak, Xiao Zhang's community responded strictly, and access was restricted during severe outbreaks. Only recently did he have access to ventilation, disinfection and equipment.
按照社区每户出一个志愿者的安排，小张加入了每天6小时的轮班，手持测温枪负责给出来进去的住户测体温。
With one volunteer per household in the community, Xiao Zhang joined a six-hour shift to take a temperature check with a thermostat.
小张把这样的出门机会当做消遣，“反正也没事做”。
Xiao Zhang took such a chance to go out as a pastime, "anyway there is nothing to do."
。
.
为了应对疫情，一些网吧开始追求转型，对外租赁现有设备成为选择之一，比如把网吧里的电脑租给用户，在家里游玩。
In order to cope with the epidemic, some Internet cafes began to pursue transformation, external rental of existing equipment has become one of the options, such as Internet cafes to rent users, play at home.
但在小张看来，这不是长久之策。
But in Zhang's view, this is not a long-term solution.
在海宁，有一家连锁网咖开始率先尝试电脑租赁业务来减少亏损，但就他的观察效果不明显，反而因为连锁店的特性，需要面临更大的工作量压力，对比之下，也许还没有自己的小店撑得更久。
In Haining, a chain of Internet cafes began experimenting with computer rental to reduce losses, but his observations were not significant. Instead, the chain's features required it to face greater workload pressures, perhaps not as long as its own.

■ 最长的一次歇业。
:: The longest closure.
小店难以支撑，规模相对大一些的店铺也不能说乐观。
Small shops are difficult to sustain, and the relatively large ones cannot be said to be optimistic.
。
.
持续的歇业正给蒋明明造成难以承受的损失，他在北京经营的两家电竞馆每月大概损失25万元人民币，如果3月中旬能恢复正常运转，那么还可以勉强承受；不然的话，他只能关闭规模较大的一家店来应对。
The continuing shutdown is taking an unbearable toll on Chiang, who is losing about 250,000 yuan a month on the two appliance galleries he runs in Beijing, which he can barely afford if it returns to normal by mid-March. Otherwise, he will have to close down a larger store.
就算如此，剩下的钱和应急资金加起来，也最多够另一家店撑到今年6月。
Even so, the rest of the money and emergency money, added up, will last another shop until June.
。
.
经营电竞馆原本出于蒋明明的兴趣。
Operation of the electricity competition originally out of Jiang Mingming's interest.
大学毕业后，蒋明明投身金融行业，在国内外多家企业从事过投资方面的工作，摸爬滚打十多年，赚取了丰富的金融经验以及亮眼的履历。
After his graduation from university, Jiang was clearly involved in the financial industry, working in many enterprises at home and abroad in the field of investment, working hard for more than ten years, and earning rich financial experience and outstanding record.
。
.
几年前，蒋明明判断电竞行业会在当前的经济环境里上升较快，加之又是自己的业余爱好，便在几年前从投资公司里招揽了一批原来的下属和自己游戏里认识的熟人，组成了电竞馆的核心团队。
A few years ago, judging by Jiang's rapid rise in the current economic environment and his hobby, Jiang recruited a group of former subordinates and acquaintances from his game from the investment company a few years ago to form the core team.
。
.
电竞馆的业务初期非常顺利。
The business of the competition was very smooth at first.
2018年11月，蒋明明的第一家店试营业，2019年1月，第二家店试营业，两家店都位于朝阳区比较火热的商圈里，又是《英雄联盟》职业联赛（LPL）在北京的官方指定训练场馆，一些小有名气的战队也会在这里进行赛前训练。
In November 2018, Chiang's first store went on trial, and in January 2019, a second shop opened, both in the hot business district of Chaoyang, and the official LPL training ground in Beijing for the Heroes league, where a number of smaller, well-known teams will also train.
。
.
EDG电竞俱乐部的成员在蒋明明的电竞馆里结束了赛前训练。
EDG Atletico Club members finished their pre-match training at Jiang Ming's Atletico.
“你可以上大众点评看看我们两家店的排名，它们在整个排行榜上都是很靠前的。
"You can go to the public and review the rankings of our two stores, which are very high up the league table.
”提到自家电竞馆，蒋明明话里透着自豪。
Jiang was proud to speak at the Home Appliances Contest.
。
.
倘若不是疫情影响，往年春节前后，电竞馆会十分忙碌。
Had it not been for the epidemic, the pavilion would have been very busy around the Spring Festival.
按照原本的日程，每年法定节假日期间电竞馆都会照常歇业，但这时如果有顾客包场，蒋明明也不愿回绝。
According to the original schedule, every year during the statutory holidays will be closed, but if there are customers, Jiang apparently refused to refuse.
2019年春节，刚刚大年初二就开始有客人打电话给蒋明明，要求电竞馆开业。
Spring Festival 2019, just two days after the beginning of the guests called Jiang Ming, the demand for the opening of the competition hall.
虽然服务人员大都回到老家过节了，蒋明明还是叫来几位合伙人，一起客串了服务人员，把活动顺利办了下去。
Although the service personnel mostly returned to their hometown for the holidays, Jiang Ming called in several partners, together with the service staff, and carried out the activities smoothly.
。
.
直到今年1月初，蒋明明还以为这一年的春节也会这样忙碌而充实地度过。
Until the beginning of January, Chiang clearly thought that the Spring Festival would be so busy and full this year.
随着疫情的消息通过各种途径传来，蒋明明渐渐紧张起来。
As news of the outbreak spread through various channels Chiang became increasingly nervous.
。
.
平日里，为了避免流感高发季节交叉感染，电竞馆里提供了一些口罩以备不时之需，但这些显然不够。
On weekdays, to avoid cross-infection during the flu season, the Atletico offered some masks for a rainy day, but these were clearly not enough.
于是，蒋明明准备了更多口罩，还督促员工严格进行消毒工作，顾客也被要求必须佩戴口罩才能使用设备。
Chiang apparently prepared more masks and urged his staff to disinfect them strictly. Customers were also required to wear masks before using them.
。
.
蒋明明对消毒的要求很严格。
Jiang is very strict about disinfection.
即便做了比较严格的应对举措，蒋明明还是没想到疫情会严重到现在这样。
Even with a more rigorous response, Chiang clearly did not expect the outbreak to be as serious as it is today.
在春节期间照常歇业后，他以为疫情最多持续到正月十五，到时候，员工正常返京，活动也能继续。
After business as usual during the Spring Festival, he thought the epidemic would last until the 15th of the first month, when employees would return to Beijing normally and activities would continue.
但很显然，这个想法落空了。
But it is clear that this idea has fallen through.
。
.
1月23日，北京在全国率先宣布取消包括17个庙会在内的4300多场春节假日文化活动……受疫情影响，全市娱乐场所、互联网经营场所和影院实际上已经全部暂停营业。
On January 23, Beijing took the lead in announcing the cancellation of more than 4,300 cultural activities on spring holidays and festivals, including 17 temple fairs across the country.
每一天过去，电竞馆歇业时间的纪录都在刷新。
With each passing day, the record for the closing hours of the competition is being refreshed.
。
.
当戴口罩成为必然，进出小区需要被测温枪顶着脑袋以后，蒋明明的出门频率变得更少了，除去偶尔到超市采购，剩下的时间大都在家闷着。
When wearing masks became inevitable and required a temperature-measuring gun to the head in and out of the district, Chiang clearly went out less often, spending most of the rest of his time at home, except for occasional shopping at the supermarket.
这种清闲的日子如坐针毡。
The days of idleness felt like a needle and thread.
倘若平时有空闲，蒋明明会打打《魔兽世界》《三国志14》，在艾泽拉斯大陆上四处闲逛，做些休闲一点的任务曾经是消磨时间、放松情绪的好办法，但想到歇业，蒋明明难免心烦，烦着烦着，就把电脑给关上了。
If he had time to spare, Chiang would have hit World of Warcraft 14 and wandered around Azeroth, doing something relaxing had been a good way of killing time and relaxing his spirits. But the thought of going out of business made Chiang irritable and irritating and shut down the computer.
。
.
每年年底，电竞馆都会承接一些年会和社区举办的电竞活动，企业也会找到电竞馆举办庆典，到了情人节，电竞馆还会提供特别活动和优惠套餐。
Every year at the end of the year, the pavilion will take on some of the annual conferences and community-sponsored competitions. Companies will also find a venue for the event. On Valentine's Day, special events and preferential packages will be offered.
因为疫情，这些活动大都被取消和搁置。
Most of these activities were cancelled and put on hold because of the outbreak.

电竞馆的扩张计划也被耽搁了。
Plans to expand the pavilion have also been delayed.
因为没有现金流入，开新店的计划没了着落。
Plans to open new stores have been lost because there is no cash flow in.
蒋明明放不下店里，大年初四那天，他跟一位员工来到位于望京SOHO的电竞馆，对着空空荡荡的机位拍了一段短视频。
Jiang clearly can not put in the store, about the beginning of Thursday, he and an employee came to the SOHO in Wangjing, took a short video against the empty seat.
视频里，他戏称自己“包下了整个网吧”。
In the video, he joked that he "contracted the entire Internet cafes."
人们大都知道没有网吧会在这时营业，评论区里很快就有人指出：“你是网吧老板吧？”也有心急的在问：“这是哪里，什么时候开门？”。
Most people know that no Internet cafes will be open at this time, comments on the area will soon be pointed out: "You are the owner of Internet cafes?" There is an urgent question: "Where is this, when to open the door?"
蒋明明并没有回复他们。
Jiang apparently did not reply to them.

蒋明明在抖音上传的短视频，一些评论者知道他是在开玩笑。
Some commentators knew Chiang was joking when he was jabbering over a short video he posted.
■ 新的一天。
▪ A new day.
新的一天开始，小鹿收获了两件让她感到开心的事。
At the beginning of the new day, the fawn reaped two things that made her happy.
萨摩耶终于被老板接回家里，这意味着她的假期兼职正式结束；原定一个月的工作最终只到岗10天，老板仍然决定支付她全额工资，这让小鹿提早确定，明年的兼职要在这家网吧里继续。
Samoyed was finally taken home by her boss, which meant her part-time job ended; the original month's work was only 10 days away, and the boss decided to pay her the full salary.
唯独让她不太高兴的是，学校的开学日期再次延后。
To her unhappiness, the start of the school year was postponed again.
。
.
“世界赶紧恢复正常吧。
"The world must return to normal.
”当原本不受学生待见的日子被赋予了代表疫情好转的意义后，小鹿开始变得更加期待开学的那一天。
When the days when students were not expected to see them were given meaning to represent an improvement in the epidemic, the deer began to look forward more to the day of school.
。
.
“在家‘吃鸡’，五杀轻轻松松，谢谢会员们的支持！”刘熊在朋友圈上传了一组照片，这里面包括一台等待组装的电脑以及几张转账记录，虽然电竞馆仍旧歇业，但他已经复工了。
Liu Xiong uploaded a group of photos in a group of friends, including a computer waiting to be assembled and some money transfer records, and although the museum is still closed, he has returned to work.
为了应对疫情，电竞馆把原本只能摆着吃灰的专业设备，按照包月的方式租赁出去，价格从每天36元到59元不等。
In order to deal with the epidemic situation, the TV competition hall will only be able to eat gray professional equipment, according to the monthly rental method, prices range from 36 yuan to 59 yuan per day.
依靠平时积累的客源，这项新业务目前进展顺利。
The new business is now going smoothly with the usual customer base.
刘熊觉得这么干不算太盈利，只能说是“聊胜于无”。
Liu Xiong felt that this is not too profitable, can only be said that "chat is better than nothing."
。
.
除了设备租赁，电竞馆还开了在线训练课程。
In addition to equipment leasing, the online training course was held in the competition.
为这些应对办法最终拍板的，是歇业期间在家不断发愁的蒋明明。
For these responses, the final decision is out of business during the constant worry of Jiang Ming at home.
没法在公司办公，他和同事们在微信上沟通，几乎每天都要和管理团队在线上开会，其中最重要的讨论就是如何应对疫情。
Unable to work at the office, he communicated with his colleagues on microcorrespondence and had almost daily meetings with the management team online, the most important of which was how to deal with the epidemic.
每过去一天，蒋明明都觉得自己看不清歇业的终点，他只能期待疫情结束得快一些。
Every day Chiang clearly felt that he could not see the end of the business. He could only hope that the epidemic would end sooner.
。
.
海宁工业区的返程高峰还没到来，大多数单位也没法复工。
The return rush to the industrial district of Haining has not yet arrived and most units are unable to resume work.
根据小张打听来的消息，网吧这类娱乐场所应该是最后才会开放，很大概率得等餐饮这类亏损更大的行业先开门。
According to Xiao Zhang, Internet cafes and other entertainment places should be the last to open, a high probability of waiting for such a loss-making industry such as catering to open first.
“只要看见他们正常营业，我们就没问题了。
"We'll have no problem seeing them open as usual.
”。
"
受到疫情影响，小张的主业也止步不前。
Affected by the epidemic, Xiao Zhang's main business has stalled.
网咖停业前，他刚刚解决掉前年的债务，准备“赚点零花钱”，停业以后，花呗、白条、信用卡像三座大山一样摆在面前。
Before it closed down, he had just settled the debts of the previous year and was going to "earn some pocket money." After the shutdown, flowers, white bars and credit cards appeared like three big mountains.
。
.
生活还是得过下去。
Life went on and on.
“要做的事情太多了。
"There is so much to do.
”春天到来前，小张没来得及剪发，理发店全部停业后，他的头发越来越长。
Before spring came, Xiao Zhang had no time to cut his hair, and his hair grew longer and longer after the barber shop had all shut down.
提到疫情结束后的计划，小张把“做一个烟花烫”排在了搓背、足浴和在海底捞吃火锅前面。
Referring to plans after the outbreak ended, Zhang lined up "do a firework burn" on the back, foot bathing and fishing in front of the hotpot.
。
.
“托尼老师，我从未感觉到如此需要你，我保证以后不对你阴阳怪气了，我保证！”。
"Miss Tony, I've never felt the need for you so much, and I promise I won't be so mean to you again, I promise!"
在知乎“疫情结束后会爆发消费狂潮吗？”这一问题下面，小张写下了这样一句话。
In the knowledge that "the end of the epidemic will erupt in the consumption frenzy?" Under this question, Xiao Zhang wrote such a sentence.
。
.
似乎很多人都有同样的烦恼。
It seems that many people have the same worries.

留在二楼的萨摩耶。
Remain on the second floor in Samoan.
“对我来说，有社保...。
"For me, social security..."
“我就一句话，工资...。
"Just one word, salary..."
最长的一次歇业。
The longest shutdown.
