反正闭店也是要损失，不如拿出来给他们（医护人员）住，人家也是来支援我们的嘛，大家都希望疫情早点过去。
In any case, the closure of the store is to lose, it is better to take out to them (medical staff) live, people are also to support us, we hope that the epidemic over sooner.

早7点起床，晚11点休息，整日奔波不着家——和被“禁足”在家的大多数武汉人不同，刘杰元这几天格外忙碌：店长、司机、联络员、采购……这个名下有5家酒店的老板，苦笑着说他连员工都不如。
Waking up at 7 a.m. and resting at 11 p. m., Liu has been particularly busy these days, unlike most Wuhan people who are forbidden to stay at home: store chiefs, drivers, liaison officers, procurement... the owner of five hotels who grinned that he was worse than his staff.
他的这五家酒店，已有3家被征用，用于安置医护人员，由于人手、物资紧缺，很多事情需要刘杰元亲自去做。
Three of his five hotels have been requisitioned to house medical staff. Because of the shortage of staff and supplies, many things need to be done by Liu Jiyuan himself.
。
.
自2010年踏入酒店业以来，这是刘杰元最忙碌的一个春节。
Since entering the hotel industry in 2010, this is Liu Jiyuan's busiest Spring Festival.
“一般春节期间，酒店从初一到初六都不会怎么忙。
"During the Spring Festival, hotels are not very busy from the first day of junior high to sixth day.
”刘杰元说，“今年又有疫情，我投资加盟的这个亚朵酒店，本来计划在1月23号就放假了，结果初一（1月25日）晚上，一个医院的护士长给我打电话说，让酒店待命，可能要征用。
"There was another outbreak this year," Liu said. "I originally planned to join the Yadu Hotel on January 23, so on the evening of January 25, a hospital matron called me and said that the hotel should be on standby for possible requisition.
”。
"
虽说酒店计划1月23日放假，但实际上从1月20日开始，员工便陆续离店回家了。
Although the hotel plans to vacate on January 23, employees actually leave the store and go home on January 20th.
接到上述电话时，刘杰元的亚朵酒店只有3个员工，“两个是留守值班的，一个是因为封城回不了家的。
At the time of receiving the call, Liu Jiyuan's Yadu hotel had only three employees, "two are on duty, one because the closure of the city can not go home.
”。
"
为了保证酒店能随时投入运营，刘杰元让店长尽快联系动员能返店的员工。
To ensure that the hotel can be put into operation at any time, Liu Jiyuan let the store director as soon as possible to mobilize staff can return to the store.
2月2日晚，店长告诉刘杰元一共有4个员工可以返店，其余员工大多数均不在武汉，难以返回，店长本人也在外地。
On the night of February 2, the store manager told Liu Jiyuan that a total of four employees could return to the store. Most of the other employees were not in Wuhan, making it difficult to return.
。
.
“我这酒店有7层，165间客房，232张床位，平常满员是44个员工。
"I have seven floors, 165 bedrooms and 232 beds, and the usual full complement of 44 staff.
”刘杰元说，“2月3号下午，从西安来支援武汉的213个医护人员就要到店入住，我留守的3个人加上可以返店的4个人，一共7个人。
"On the afternoon of February 3, 213 medical personnel from Xi'an who had come to support Wuhan were coming to the store," Liu said.
没办法，只能又喊了另外俩股东过来帮忙。
There was no choice but to yell at the other two shareholders for help.
”。
"
返店的4个人中，有两个人是刘杰元3日一大早开车去接来的，“禁车了，没有公交地铁，只好我开车去接，我有通行证。
Two of the four people who returned to the store were picked up by Liu Jiyuan in the early morning of the 3rd. "There is no bus ban, so I have to pick up the bus, I have a pass.
”人员到店后，刘杰元带员工检查了水、电、空调，对165间客房分类分层做好房卡，在医护人员下午4点到店前做好了各种准备工作。
"When the staff arrived at the store, Liu took the staff to inspect the water, electricity and air-conditioning, tiered the 165 rooms and made preparations for the arrival of the staff at the store at 4 p.m.
。
.
7个店员分工明确：厨房2个、保洁2个、前台一个，另外2个一个是工程一个是保安。
Seven shop assistants clear division of labor: kitchen 2, cleaning 2, front one, the other 2 is engineering one is security.
而刘杰元，则身兼数职：店长、司机、联络员、采购……“我连员工都不如，好在我身体还行，平常也闲不住。
Liu Jiyuan, on the other hand, a number of functions: store director, driver, liaison, procurement...... "I even less than the staff, but fortunately my body is OK, usually not idle.
前几天在家呆着待命，给我憋坏了。
Stay at home the other day. I'm pissed off.
”刘杰元苦笑道。
"Liu Jiyuan smiled bitterly.
。
.
(刘杰元开车去接理发师来酒店给医护人员理发。
) Liu Jiyuan drove to pick up the barber and gave the paramedics a haircut.

除了这个亚朵酒店，刘杰元在武汉还有另外四家酒店，其中两家已经被征用，“一个是40间客房，一个是60间客房，好在当时这两个店都没放假，员工还都在。
In addition to the Ardot hotel, Liu Jiyuan also has four other hotels in Wuhan, two of which have already been requisitioned. "One is a 40-room hotel and one is a 60-room hotel.
”被征用后，刘杰元的两个儿子在帮忙负责这两个酒店的运营。
"After the requisition, Liu's two sons helped run the two hotels.
。
.
“我们三个男的成天不着家，家里就只有老婆、两个儿媳和小孩，她们成天‘嚼’，担心我们。
"The three of us couldn't get home all day and all we had was a wife, two daughters-in-law and children, who chewed and worried about us all day long.
”说话间，刘杰元又接到一个儿媳的电话，让他回家的时候带些香菇和西红柿，“她们平常都是在网上买菜，让我带干嘛？就是想让我回家。
'As he spoke, Liu received another call from his daughter-in-law, asking him to bring some mushrooms and tomatoes with him when he came home.
”。
"
200多名医护人员入住，吃饭和卫生是头等大事。
More than 200 medical staff checked in, and food and hygiene were a top priority.
“食材方面，政府部门答应供应；酒店布草原本是按一比三的量准备的，目前还能撑几天，布草公司也答应尽快开工；一次性消耗品原本也有些，不够了再从我其它两个没被征用的酒店调；口罩和消毒水，目前也还有些。
"In terms of supplies, the government agreed to supply the materials; the hotel prairie was prepared on a scale of one to three, and the linen company promised to start work as soon as possible; there were some disposable consumables, not enough to be transferred from my other two unrequisitioned hotels; masks and disinfectant, and still some.
”刘杰元介绍，因为人手紧张，也为了防止交叉感染，店员不进医护人员房间，房间卫生由入住者自己打扫。
"Because of staffing constraints and to prevent cross-infection, shop assistants do not come into staff rooms, which are cleaned by the occupants themselves, Liu said.
。
.
2月4日晚，刘杰元遇到一件难事，入住的医护人员向他求助，他们需要理发师理发，以方便穿防护服。
On the night of February 4, Liu encountered a difficult problem, check-in medical staff asked him for help, they need hairdressers to facilitate wearing protective clothing.
刘杰元先是联系了两个他经常去的理发店，但对方均称已经放假，无法派人。
Liu first contacted two of the barber shops he used to go to, but each said it was too late for a holiday.
之后，他又联系了金银潭医院，“他们那边有部队来支援的医生，我想部队上的人一般都自己理发，想跟他们借理发工具，但人家说已经转到火神山医院了。
After that, he contacted the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital. "There's a doctor on the other side of the hospital who is supported by troops. I think the men in the army usually have their hair cut and want to borrow a hairdressing tool from them, but they say they have turned to Mount Fire Hospital.
”。
"
经儿子提醒，刘杰元想起他亲家的外甥是理发师，“但他人在汉川（属孝感），进不来武汉。
Reminded by his son, Liu recalled that his nephew was a barber, "but he couldn't get into Wuhan because of his filial piety.
最后他联系了一个武汉同行，我今天（2月5日）开车去把人家接到酒店干活。
Finally, he contacted a Wuhan colleague, I today (February 5) to drive people to work in the hotel.
”刘杰元说，“我在车上给他（理发师）说，人家是来支援咱们武汉的，所以到了酒店不要提费用的事儿，有费用我出。
"I told him (the barber) in the car that they had come to support us in Wuhan, so don't mention the charge at the hotel, at my expense.
”。
"
西安来的这200多名医护人员中，有一百五六十位是女性，大多需要剪发。
Of the more than 200 medical workers in Xi'an, one hundred and fifty or sixty are women, most of whom need haircuts.
理发师带着爱人帮忙，俩人穿着防护服，在酒店大堂开了工。
With the help of their lovers, the barbers wore protective clothing and started work in the lobby of the hotel.
医护人员抽号排队理发，一溜儿站了十几个人。
The paramedics queued up for a haircut and a dozen people lined up.
刘杰元看着发愁：“这得剪到什么时候去？”索性又联系了亲家外甥，让他帮忙再找一个理发师。
Liu Jiyuan looked at worry: "How long does it have to go?" simply contacted in-laws, asked him to help find another barber.

之后，刘杰元又驱车十几公里，去接第二个理发师。
After that, Liu Jiyuan drove a dozen kilometers to pick up a second hairdresser.
武汉城区高楼林立、道路宽阔，但这段时间街面上人车稀少。
Wuhan city high-rise buildings, wide roads, but this time on the streets are scarce.
刘杰元有些忧虑，“疫情对旅游业、酒店业的影响不会是这一两个月。
"The impact of the epidemic on the tourism and hotel industry will not be a month or two," Liu said.
”。
"
“酒店我做了十年，从单体店做起，后来改做经济快捷型酒店，去年刚开始做中高端酒店，一进来就碰到这种情况。
"I've been doing this for ten years, starting with a single store and moving into an economical and fast-moving hotel.
”刘杰元叹了一口气，补充道：“我投资的这个酒店，花了3000多万元，（去年）7月29号才开业，原本计划四年左右收回投资。
"The hotel I invested in, which cost more than 30 million yuan (last year), didn't open until July 29 and had planned to withdraw its investment in about four years," Liu added with a sigh.
正在上升期，就碰上这事（疫情）。
It happened just as we were on our way up.
”。
"
刘杰元说，“这个酒店（亚朵）一个月运营成本得120万元左右，房租和品牌方管理费一月得六七十万元，现在这种情况，管理费可以减免，房租或许可以暂缓。
'This hotel [Ardor] costs about 1.2 million yuan a month to run, and rents and brand management fees cost 6.7 million yuan a month, 'Mr. Liu says.
员工工资和社保是雷打不动的，一月得20多万元，还有其它杂七杂八的水电费用……”。
Salaries and social security are flat, more than 200,000 yuan a month, and other miscellaneous utilities... "
关于征用期间的费用问题，刘杰元表示，“我还没提，但是先一起把危机度过再说吧，相信党和政府会妥善处理好的”。
"I haven't mentioned it yet, but let's get through the crisis together and trust the Party and the government will deal with it properly," Liu said.
。
.
“往大里说，我们好像是做些贡献做些牺牲。
"To put it mildly, we seem to be doing something to make sacrifices.
实际上，与其说我们是在帮助别人，不如说我们是在自救。
In fact, we are not so much helping others as helping ourselves.
”。
