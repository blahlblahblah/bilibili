武汉玩家。
Wuhan gamers.
这篇文章写的是武汉玩家的故事，它显然不仅仅关于游戏。
This article is about Wuhan gamers, and it is clearly not just about games.
游戏作为一个精神载体和文化切面，它试图讲述更大的主题：在这场灾难中，我们也有好多次得以窥见一种更本质的人，以及对人类共同命运的指向；而无论是好是坏，我们终究在各种各样的境遇里更加了解他人和自身。
Play, as a spiritual vehicle and a cultural dimension, tries to tell the larger story: many times in this disaster we have also been able to glimpse a more fundamental human being and the direction of the common destiny of mankind; and, for better or worse, we have come to know more about others and ourselves in all kinds of situations.

这篇文章写的是3个武汉人的故事：在这个特殊的时期，他们过着怎样的日子，有着怎样的精神面貌，以及怎样看待游戏对于当下生活的意义。
This article is about three Wuhan people: in this special period, they lived what kind of life, what kind of mental outlook, and how to view the significance of games in the present life.
他们的故事不能代表所有的武汉人，也不能反映关于这座城市的全部，但这些真实而质朴的生活图景，令我感到珍贵。
Their stories do not represent all the Wuhan people, nor all about the city, but these real and simple life, I feel precious.
。
.
不知道为什么，这个担子就落到了秋秋头上。
Do not know why, this burden fell on autumn and autumn.
。
.
那会儿秋秋还在北京，就收到了远在武汉的爸爸吩咐：回来带爷爷去看病。
Qiuqiu was still in Beijing when his father told him to come back and take Grandpa to see the doctor.
。
.
大概在一个星期前，爷爷身上出现了一些症状：咳嗽，喘不上气，食欲不振，整个人都很虚弱。
About a week ago, Grandpa had some symptoms: coughing, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and weakness.
对于一个90岁的老人而言，平时这点小病小痛可能算不上什么事儿，但在这个节骨眼上，秋秋就感到有点紧张。
For a 90-year-old, a minor ailment may not be a big deal, but at this juncture, Qiuqiu feels a bit nervous.
“爷爷的症状很像那个病。
"Grandpa's symptoms look much like that.
”她说。
'she said.
。
.
1月20号，秋秋回到武汉，21号把爷爷从汉口中心城区接到相对偏远的江夏区安顿下来，22号早上8点多带他去了医院。
On January 20th, Qiuqiu returned to Wuhan, where he was taken to the hospital at 8: 00 a.m. on January 22nd by 21, when Grandpa was transferred from the central city of Hankou to the relatively remote Jiangxia district.
秋秋直接挂了消化科。
Autumn and Autumn directly linked to the digestive department.
“呼吸科那边排的队太长了，而且爷爷当时主要的问题是吃不下东西，所以我就给他挂了消化科，但我一去就直接跟医生说，要做CT和血常规。
"The line in the respiratory department was too long and Grandpa's main problem was that he couldn't eat, so I gave him a digestive tract, but I went straight to the doctor and told him to have a CT and a blood routine.
”。
"
这是她从网上看来的。
That's what she looks at online.
“当时还没有核酸，网上说最重要的指标一个是血氧饱和度，一个是肺部感染的阴影，我想那就直接判断一下。
"There was no nucleic acid yet, and the most important indicator on the Internet was blood oxygen saturation and the shadow of lung infection, so I think we'll go straight to it.
”秋秋说，在当时，大多数人可能还没有这个意识，有了症状都去看呼吸科，所以爷爷的检查没有花很长时间。
At the time, most people probably weren't aware of it and went to the respiratory department for symptoms, so Grandpa's tests didn't take long.
。
.
当天傍晚出了结果。
The results came out in the evening.
秋秋又跑了一趟医院，拿到了爷爷的诊断书。
Qiuqiu went to the hospital again and got his grandfather's medical certificate.
她看不太明白具体数字，想找个医生问问，消化科大部分医生已经下班了，只有呼吸科的医生还在加班，但排队的人实在太多。
She couldn't figure out the exact figure and wanted to see a doctor. Most of the digestive doctors were off duty and only the ventilator was working overtime, but there were too many queues.
最后她找了个住院部的值班医生。
Finally she got a doctor on duty at the inpatient department.
“医生说他血常规是正常的，但是有肺部感染，目前不确定是不是病毒性的，感觉不太像。
"The doctor said his blood routine was normal, but there was a lung infection and it's not certain it was viral," he said.
医生说，如果我们怀疑的话，可以第二天再去呼吸科看看。
The doctor said that if we were suspicious, we could go to the respiratory department the next day.
”。
"
秋秋给我发来了爷爷的诊断书。
Qiuqiu sent me a medical certificate from my grandfather.
回家以后，秋秋睡不着。
After returning home, Qiuqiu couldn't sleep.
爷爷倒是不太担心自己，他觉得老了反正会有各种各样的毛病，跟这次的肺炎没有关系，可秋秋怎么可能放心得下呢？爷爷身上的种种症状都很“疑似”——当时人人嘴边都挂着这个词儿，真正能够确诊的人数却很少很少。
Grandpa wasn't so worried about himself, he felt that old age would have all sorts of problems, which had nothing to do with the pneumonia, but how could Qiuqiu rest easy? The symptoms of Grandpa were "suspected" - the word was on everyone's lips at the time, but the number of people who could actually be diagnosed was very small.
她翻来翻去地想，但也没有更好的办法。
She rummaged, but there was no better way.
。
.
她总是想起白天的时候跟爷爷几次穿过呼吸科就诊的人群，虽然戴了口罩，她也觉得害怕。
She was always thinking of the people who had walked through the respiratory department with her grandfather several times during the day, and though she was wearing a mask, she was afraid.
。
.
“在当时那个瞬间还是有一点茫然。
'At that moment there was still a vagueness.
”秋秋说，“心里想的都是，不会真的被选中了吧？”。
Qiuqiu said, "What I'm thinking is that I won't really be chosen."
小郑的爸爸到现在都还有点低烧。
Zheng's father is still a little feverish.
他去医院看过，检查出来与肺部感染无关，“不是那个病”，但小郑也不能完全放心。
He went to the hospital, check out the lung infection is not related to "not that disease," but Zheng can not completely rest assured.
那天爸爸在社区附近的医院排队时，排在他前面的一个老太太被诊出高度疑似，没有核酸试剂确诊不了。
The day his father queued up at a hospital near the neighborhood, an old lady in front of him was diagnosed as highly suspicious, undiagnosed without nucleic acid reagents.
后来，住在隔壁小区的舅舅告诉他，他们的业主群里有人发了一条求助信息，说是有个老太太已经快不行了，拖了一个多星期还没有排上核酸试剂。
Later, his uncle, who lived in the neighborhood next door, told him that a group of owners had sent a message of help that an old lady had run out of nucleic acid for more than a week.
小郑感到后怕，那个老太太和爸爸在同一天去了同一家医院。
Zheng felt afraid that the old lady and his father went to the same hospital the same day.
。
.
“会不会就是同一个人？”小郑心里也打鼓，但他知道这事儿没法弄明白，“可能也不是吧，说不清了，说不清了。
"Can be the same person?" Zheng also played drums in his heart, but he knew this matter could not understand, "may not be it, unclear, unclear.
”。
"
小郑在地铁工作，1月23号是他年前最后一个出勤的日子，他像往常一样凌晨4点醒来，看了看手机，发现有个朋友在夜里给他发了条消息，问他是不是要放假了，还传了一张网上的截图给他。
On January 23, his last day on the subway, he woke up at 4 a.m. as usual, looked at his cell phone, found a friend who had sent him a message in the night asking if he was going to have a holiday, and sent him a screenshot of the Internet.
。
.
他不太相信，到了点就照常去车辆段的派班室出勤。
He was incredulous and went to the vehicle fleet room as usual at a certain point.
刚到那儿，班组长就问他，消息收到了没有。
Arriving there, the class leader asked him if he had received the news.
他说收到了。
He said he got it.
班组长说，现在问题可能比较严重了，没什么事情你就不要去外地了，自己注意一下。
The team leader said that the problem may be more serious now, nothing you do not go to the field, pay attention to yourself.
。
.
小郑觉得自己被一个巨大的噩耗砸中了。
Zheng felt that he had been hit by a terrible news.
“那话听了我就难受……我当时还以为过了这几天就完事儿了，我本来想的是初一、初二就在家里，初三、初四正常上班，过几天再去我女朋友那边，还跟朋友约了泡温泉……看这样子就不太现实了。
I thought it would be over in the last few days. I thought it would be the first and second day of junior high school at home, the third and fourth day of the normal work, after a few days to go to my girlfriend there, and friends with hot springs... look at this is not realistic.
”。
"
这最后一天上班，一切都跟平时一样。
It was the last day of work, and everything was the same as usual.
“检车，然后把车开出来正常运营。
"Check the car and drive it out for normal operation.
”小郑跟我说，“其实那两天就没什么人坐车了，站内冷冷清清。
"Zheng said to me," In fact, those two days on the car, the station is cold and empty.
”。
"
那天的工作结束得特别早。
The work that day ended very early.
上午8点他就下班回家了。
He came home from work at 8 a.m.
上午10点，武汉轨道交通各条线路最后一趟车从各起点站发出，到达终点站后结束运营，所有车站出入口拉下了卷帘门。
At 10: 00 a.m., the last train of Wuhan Rail Transit lines was sent from each starting point to the end of operation, and all station entrances and exits pulled down the rolled-up doors.
。
.
1月23日起至今，武汉实行交通管制。
Wuhan has practiced traffic control since January 23.
许多人赶在最后一刻离开了武汉，秋秋的爸爸是其中之一。
Qiuqiu's father was one of many who left Wuhan at the last minute.
他与秋秋的妈妈离婚后，和另一个阿姨组建了新的家庭，阿姨还带了个比秋秋大一些的姐姐。
After divorcing Qiuqiu's mother, he started a new family with another aunt, who also brought a older sister than Qiuqiu.
23号上午10点多，秋秋的爸爸在高速上的服务站里给她打电话，告诉她，他们3个人赶在封城前一个小时出了城，这会儿已经快到岳阳了。
Autumn's father called her from the service station on the expressway in the late morning of 10: 00 a.m. on the 23rd. He told her that the three of them had left the city an hour before the city was closed.
。
.
秋秋的爸爸倒不是自己要跑，而是为了把在上海工作的姐姐给送回去。
Qiuqiu's father did not want to run, but to work in Shanghai to send back his sister.
“姐姐知道了交通管制的消息就比较激动，怕之后回不去，他们就赶在10点前把姐姐送出去了。
"My sister was very excited when she heard the news of traffic control. She was afraid that she would not be able to go back.
”秋秋告诉我，他们打算在岳阳把姐姐送上回上海的飞机，在那里住两个晚上，之后再回武汉。
Qiuqiu told me that they were planning to send their sister back to Shanghai on a plane in Yueyang, where they would stay for two nights before returning to Wuhan.
。
.
在电话的那一头，爸爸听上去特别开心的样子，“情绪很高昂”。
At the other end of the line, Dad sounded particularly happy. He was in a high mood.
打这个电话主要是想告诉她，他和阿姨两个人打算留在岳阳过年，不能去爷爷奶奶家跟她一块吃年饭了。
The main purpose of this phone call is to tell her that he and his aunt are going to stay in Yueyang for the New Year.
。
.
秋秋当时整个人都懵了。
Qiuqiu was stunned.
那天早上她一直不停地接电话：“我妈妈的，我闺蜜的，我同学的，还有我老板的。
That morning she kept on answering the phone: "My mother's, my girl's, my classmate's and my boss's.
因为看到了交通管制的消息，他们都轮番打电话过来问我怎么样，一直到10点多钟接到我爸的电话……你能懂那种很懵的心情吗？就是其他所有人，可能没有血缘关系的人都在关心你的时候，你的亲人给你打了一个这样的电话。
After seeing the traffic control news, they all called me in turn and asked me how I was, until after 10 o'clock my father called you... Can you understand that kind of muddled mood?
”。
"
其实她在凌晨就已经看到了消息，裹着大衣坐在沙发上想了一夜，最后决定留在武汉。
In fact, she had seen the news in the early morning, wrapped in an overcoat sitting on the sofa for a night, and finally decided to stay in Wuhan.
“虽然当时有高铁、有飞机，10点前是可以走的，但我走了爷爷奶奶怎么办？我万一是潜在的感染者怎么办？”她也没考虑过让爸爸把她送出城，但“我对他过于了解，我觉得这件事不足以让他从睡眠中起来，帮我解决……我也不愿意求他，你知道的，就想保有一点可笑的话语权和底气”。
"Although there was a high-speed train and a plane, it was OK before 10 o'clock, but what if I left my grandparents?" She didn't think about getting Dad to send her out of town, but "I knew him too well to ask him to get out of sleep and help me.
。
.
“北京那边，哪怕回不去也就不回去了。
"Beijing, even if you can't go back, will not go back.
”秋秋说，“但爸爸没有问过我。
"Qiuqiu said," But Dad didn't ask me.
”。
"
挂了电话以后，她把爸爸拉黑了。
When she hung up the phone, she blackened her father.
。
.
在施行交通管制的当天，很多人离开了武汉，同时也有很多人感到自己“被抛下”。
On the day of traffic control, many people left Wuhan, while many felt left behind.
与20出头的秋秋和小郑相比，39岁的石磊在疫情中的样子更像一个大人。
Shi Lei, 39, looks more like an adult in the epidemic than Qiu Qiu and Zheng, who are in their early 20s.
。
.
在石磊看来，越是在这样的关头，恐慌和害怕之类的情绪越没有什么用。
At times like this, panic and fear seem to Mr. Shi to be of little use.
“我恰恰觉得这个时候要冷静理性地去看待这个事情。
"I just think it's time to look at it calmly and rationally.
”石磊说，“第一，做好自己和家人的保护；第二，努力去做一些科普；第三，做一些力所能及的事情。
"First, protect yourself and your family; secondly, try to do something about science; and thirdly, do something within your power.
”。
"
这其中包括作为志愿者司机接送上下班的医护人员。
This includes medical staff who travel to and from work as volunteer drivers.
石磊那几天常常经过长江大桥、长江二桥、二七桥等几条主要的过江通道，每一次他都会在桥上看到穿着白大褂的医护人员在奋力地蹬着共享单车。
In those days, Mr. Shi often crosses several major river crossings, including the Yangtze River Bridge, the Yangtze River Er Qiao and the 27 Bridge.
。
.
那几天武汉特别冷，最低气温达到零度以下。
Wuhan was especially cold those days, with the lowest temperature below zero.
江面上风又大，吹在脸上跟刀刮似的。
The river had the upper hand and blew on its face like a knife.
虽然桥都不长，开车一两分钟就过去了，“但是蹬自行车可能要小20分钟”，石磊说。
Although the bridge was short, a minute or two later, "but pedaling can take 20 minutes," Shi said.
。
.
在全市公共交通停运后，这样的场景就成了寻常事。
After the city's public transportation was shut down, such scenes became commonplace.
“据我所知，大量的医护人员要么就是在医院待着不走，要么就是家里有事必须来回跑的，除了蹬共享单车，还有人靠脚走十几公里回家。
"So far as I know, there are a lot of paramedics who either stay in the hospital or have to run around the house on business.
”。
"
石磊想帮这个忙。
Shi Lei wants to help.
在公共交通停运的当天晚上，他恰好在朋友圈里看到志愿者招募启事，就进了其中一个群——这个群建得早，群里有司机，有医护，还有一些其他公益机构的。
On the night of the public transit outage, he happened to see a job posting in a group of friends - an early-stage group with drivers, health care and other public-interest groups.
后来建起来的群大致分为医护群和司机群，组织者在医护群里搜集整合了出行需求后，再分发到各个司机群里。
Later groups were divided into groups of health-care workers and drivers, with organizers gathering and consolidating travel needs in a health-care group and distributing it to various groups of drivers.
司机群也分得更细了，有按照区域分的，也有按照开车距离分的；接送的也不只是医护人员，也有接送警察的，也有运送物资的。
Drivers were divided into sections by region and by distance; not only were medical staff brought in, but also the police, and supplies were delivered.
。
.
所有的工作全都靠微信群进行线上沟通和协调。
All the work depends on the microphone community for online communication and coordination.
石磊看到，“每天群里的单子都在不停地滚动”。
"Every day the list in the group scrolls on and on," Shi said.
自从加入志愿者团队后，石磊每天差不多都会跑个两三趟。
Since joining the volunteer team, Shi Lei has made almost two or three trips a day.
他说这在司机群里并不算多。
He said it wasn't much of a driver's group.
“我知道有个司机一天跑掉了一箱油，少说也得有500公里。
"I know of one driver who ran away with a crate of oil a day, or at least 500 kilometers.
”。
"
“按你的估计，一个志愿者要负责对接多少个医护人员才够？”我问。
"According to your estimate, how many paramedics would a volunteer be responsible for docking?" I asked.
。
.
“永远都不够。
"It will never be enough.
”石磊说。
"said Shi.
。
.
石磊有时会在清晨出去接送。
Shi Lei sometimes goes out in the morning to pick him up.
在机动车限行令颁布后，石磊没有收到通知短信，于是照常接单。
After the issuance of the motor vehicle restriction order, Shi Lei did not receive the notice message, so as usual orders.
他在路上碰到过两次警察，有一次医生正好就坐在他的后座上。
He met the police twice on the road, and once the doctor was sitting in the back of his seat.
虽然有令在前，警察劝他“尽量还是回去”，但警察也知道他为什么会出来。
Despite orders to do so, the police advised him to "go back as much as possible," but the police knew why he had come out.
“警察的态度都很好，还给我敬了个礼。
"The police have a good attitude and have given me a salute.
”。
"
石磊感慨说，在这次疫情中令他印象最深的一点是，无论是警察还是环卫工人，无论是外卖小哥还是渣土车司机，“所有留守在一线的人都很好，相互都很支持”。
What impressed him most about the outbreak, he said, was that whether it was the police or sanitation workers, whether they were take-out brothers or dirt-truck drivers, "all those who stayed on the front lines were very good and supportive of each other."
包括后来他的小区业主群里组织团购食品和日用品时，他注意到很多年轻人都在出力，“给大家买菜、买药啦，团购各种物资啦，也会给物业人员捐赠一些，有的还直接去帮物业做事儿”。
As he later organized group shopping for food and groceries in his small neighborhood, he noticed that many young people were doing their part "by buying things for everyone, buying medicines, buying things in groups, donating some to property people, and some going directly to help with property."
他有时候会跟这些年轻人聊起来，他们说自己平时也玩儿游戏，“但这段时间就没有什么精力和兴致去玩了，想要做点力所能及的事情”。
He would sometimes talk to these young people, who said they played games too, "but there was no energy or interest to play these days and there was a need to do something within their power."
。
.
虽然处在特殊时期，石磊一直都在尽力地维持平常的生活秩序。
Although in a special period, Shi Lei has been trying to maintain a normal life order.
他的小区旁边有一条顶级的绿道，平日里隔一天就会跑一次；就算在疫情期间，他也坚持两三天跑一次，一次跑上10公里左右。
His neighborhood had a top green track that ran every other day, and even during the outbreak he ran two or three days, about 10 kilometers at a time.
。
.
最近他的烦恼是，武汉所有小区都实行了封闭式管理，他的跑步计划也中断了。
His latest annoyance is that all districts in Wuhan are under closed management and his running plans have been disrupted.
。
.
“通俗一点讲就是，我人麻了。
"Popular point is, I am numb.
”小郑向我形容他这段日子的生活，“没有感情，没有痛觉，也不想动弹。
"Zheng described his life to me as one of" no feelings, no pain, no movement.
每天活着都是靠惯性。
It's inertia to live every day.
今天的你还没有过完，你就能想到明天的你还是这鸟样。
Today you have not finished, you can think of tomorrow you are the same bird.
”。
"
这种感觉和平日里上班是不同的。
This feeling is different from going to work on weekdays.
虽然也是日复一日地生活，但小郑觉得，“现在年轻人还不得给自己找点乐子，是吧？”在这样的特殊时期，平日里习以为常的小乐子就显得尤其珍贵了。
Though he also lives day after day, he feels that "young people are not going to have a bit of fun yet, are they?" At such special times, the usual little pleasures are especially valuable.
“上班的时候想着下班去干啥，放假的时候又会去想放假的时候干啥，过节的时候奖励一下自己，想想我有什么想买的，就是这种很琐碎的细节。
"What I want to do at work, what I want to do during the holidays, what I want to do during the holidays, what I want to buy during the holiday season, and I think about what I want to buy.
但这会儿完全没有了，完全不会去思考这些东西，平常看来是很普通的想法，在这个时候都消失了。
But now it was gone, completely unable to think at all about these things, and the usual ordinary thoughts vanished at this moment.
”。
"
“如果说我是个创作者的话，画画的，写小说的，我现在一定陷入枯竭状态了，脑子里什么都没有。
If I were a creator, a painter, a writer of novels, I must be in a state of exhaustion, with nothing in my mind.
”小郑说。
"said Xiao Zheng.
。
.
自从疫情爆发，小郑就没离开过电脑。
Since the outbreak, Zheng has not left the computer.
刚回到家里头两天，他还尝试了一些新游戏，但后来对主机游戏就有点不耐烦了。
On his first two days at home, he tried some new games, but later became a little impatient with the host game.
“原来玩主机的时候是那种比较惬意的状态，现在天天闷在家里，心里压着个事儿，感觉又有点抑郁，最渴望的其实是社交。
"When I was playing the host computer, I was in a more comfortable state. Now, I feel a little depressed because I am bored at home every day.
”。
"
在家里的时间实在难熬，和朋友一起玩游戏就成了一个打发时间的方法——或许也不是最好的方法，但除此以外还能做什么呢？他玩《剑网叁》，玩《最终幻想14》，玩一些暴雪的游戏，基本上都是和朋友一起开黑，每天玩上十几个小时，“但实际上在玩的过程中也没有太多交流”。
Playing games with friends is a way to kill time - and maybe not the best way to do it, but what else? He played Sword III, Final Fantasy 14, some Blizzard games, basically black-out with friends for more than a dozen hours a day, and "not really communicating much in the game."
。
.
小郑的心情很复杂。
Zheng's mood is very complex.
他需要线上游戏来维持一定程度的社交，但有的时候又想要避免与人交流。
He needs online games to maintain a certain level of sociability, but sometimes he wants to avoid communication.
“在线上游戏中还是会遇到一些关于疫情的负面消息，某个人的同学得了病老是不好，某个人那边又有了什么新情况。
"On-line games are still going to encounter some negative news about the epidemic, someone's classmate is always ill is not good, someone on the side of what new situation.
”这些线上的伙伴们大多都来自四川、浙江等省份，“大家都是我周围的人”，小郑告诉我，这会让他感到有些压抑。
"Most of these online partners are from Sichuan, Zhejiang and other provinces," everyone is around me, "Zheng told me, which would make him a little depressed.
。
.
一些人的生活有了翻天覆地的变化，大多数人的生活其实没有太多波澜——但他们也有自己的问题。
Some people's lives have changed dramatically, and most people's lives are not too turbulent - but they also have their own problems.
他在游戏里遇到的湖北人普遍比较沉默。
He met in the game Hubei people are generally more silent.
“包括我以前打的一个固定团，这一个团里全是湖北人。
'Including a regiment which I had once played, and which was composed entirely of Hubei people.
大家能聊什么呢？我们都闭口不言。
What can we talk about? We all kept silent.
”小郑说，“这个我们是很有默契的，都不聊。
"said Zheng." We have a lot of understanding and we don't talk.
”。
"
小郑也从来不在游戏里跟人聊关于疫情的事情。
Zheng also never in the game with people to talk about the epidemic.
“玩游戏是为了排解一下心情，刻意地去聊这些，让自己心情沉重，那不是自相矛盾吗？”小郑说，“虽然心里总会搁着点什么东西，但我也不想给别人造成负面情绪，让外面的人觉得武汉人怎么样，觉得我可怜。
"Is it not a contradiction to play games in order to relieve one's moods and deliberately talk about them and make yourself sad," said Xiao Zheng. "Although I always put something aside in my heart, I don't want to create a negative mood and make people feel sorry for me.
我也不想干这种事。
I don't want to do anything like that.
”。
"
所以，当游戏里的伙伴们问起时，他就告诉他们都挺好的。
So when his playmates asked him, he told them he was all right.
家里人没事，他自己也没事，相信很快会好起来。
His family was fine, and he was all right himself, and he was sure to get well soon.
。
.
他现在每天还是在游戏上花很长时间，但最大的问题是，游戏也不再能够令他感到高兴了。
He still spends a lot of time playing games every day, but the biggest problem is that they no longer make him happy.
“越来越难受了。
"It's getting worse.
”小郑说，“最开始的时候还有一点点这种想法，觉得多出很多时间来玩游戏还不错，但其实更多的是难受。
"There was a little bit of this in the beginning," Zheng said. "It was nice to spend a lot of time playing games, but it was more of a pain.
”。
"
对现在的小郑来说，游戏不再是一个休闲娱乐的选择，反倒像是日常生活的填充物，毕竟不干这个也干不了别的。
For Zheng now, the game is no longer a recreational choice, but rather like the filling of daily life, after all, not this can do nothing else.
在游戏中他也很少能感受到什么情感波动。
In the game he seldom feels any emotion fluctuation.
“还是有那么一丢丢感觉的，只是没那么容易感到开心了。
"It's just not that easy to be happy.
”。
"
他觉得自己这样也不算辛苦。
He didn't think he was working too hard.
“毕竟很多人也都是这么过的。
"After all, that's how a lot of people do.
像那些没有电脑的人，他们怎么过的呢？还不是一样过。
Like people who don't have computers, how do they get along? Not yet.
”小郑告诉我，他在网上看到一个大妈自己跟自己打麻将，一个人打4个角，还要算哪一边赢了钱，哪一边输了钱。
"Zheng told me that he saw a big mother playing mahjong with herself on the Internet, and that if a person played four corners, which side won the money and which side lost.
“不要以为这是段子，是真的有人这么去做的，不也过得挺好的？”。
"Don't think this is a piece of paper, it is really someone to do so, not also a good life?"
“那你不觉得这反而像是……太寂寞的状态吗？”我问。
"Don't you think it's... too lonely?" I asked.
。
.
“完不了的，人怎么可能这么就疯了？人要是这么简单就疯了的话，那人早就没了。
How can one be so mad? If a man were so simple, he would be gone.
”小郑笑着对我说，“人类可太会了。
"Little Zheng smiled at me and said," Man is too good.
”。
"
“我现在觉得难受，也是我一时接受不了。
"I feel terrible now, and I can't take it at the moment.
等我能接受了，那又是另一番天地了。
When I can accept it, it will be another world.
”小郑说，“主要是不接受还能咋地？日子总是要过的，你说这有啥用。
"The main thing is not to accept but how? The days are always going to be there," he said.
”。
"
“想过以后的时间要怎么打发吗？”我问。
"Think about how the next time will be spent?" I asked.
。
.
“换个游戏。
"Change the game.
”小郑说。
"said Xiao Zheng.

自从22号那天带爷爷去看病后，秋秋就再也没有出过门。
Qiuqiu has never been out of the house since he took his grandpa to see him on the 22nd.
当时她从医院拿了一些抗生素，但爷爷不太听话，不把这个病放在心上，药也没怎么吃。
At that time she took some antibiotics from the hospital, but Grandpa was not very obedient, did not take the disease to heart, the medicine did not eat much.
万幸的是，爷爷在一个星期后自个儿就逐渐好了起来。
Luckily, Grandpa got better by himself a week later.
秋秋这才松了口气。
Qiuqiu was relieved.
。
.
“虽然爷爷最后不是这个病，但你会有种感觉吧，致死率面前亲情算什么。
"Although grandpa is not the final illness, but you will have a feeling that the death rate in front of the family is what.
”秋秋回想起当时爸爸吩咐她带爷爷去看病的事，语气很平静，“我想我爸当时可能有那么一瞬间觉得爷爷是这个病，他就不想带他去医院，等我回来让我带他去。
Autumn and Autumn thought of her father telling her to take Grandpa to see a doctor. "I think my father thought for a moment that Grandpa was ill and he didn't want to take him to the hospital until I came back and let me take him.
”。
"
“我爸是有车的，其实最好的办法就是他直接带爷爷去看病，就不用我各种折腾。
"My father has a car, in fact, the best way is that he directly take Grandpa to see a doctor, I do not have to all kinds of trouble.
就算不在汉口看，开车到江夏也可以，但我爸可能觉得汉口跑到江夏去太远了吧，他懒得去。
Even if not in Hankou, driving to Jiangxia can be, but my father may think Hankou ran too far to Jiangxia, he was too lazy to go.
”秋秋说，“我爸是那种比较自我的人，他怎么舒服怎么来。
Qiuqiu said, "My father is the kind of person who is more self-conscious.
”。
"
她感到自己虽然在疫区，却也不算是风暴的中心。
She felt that she was not the center of the storm, though she was in the epidemic area.
最强烈的真实感可能来自小区里的高音喇叭，它每天用武汉口音循环播放：“重要的事情说三遍！不要出门！不要出门！不要出门！”。
The strongest sense of realism may come from the loudspeaker in the neighborhood, which circulates with an Wuhan accent every day: "Say the important things three times! Don't go out! Don't go out! Don't go out!"
秋秋告诉我，她感到自己的四周正在上演一出戏。
Qiuqiu told me that she felt a play going on around her.
外面的人可能会把武汉看作是一个整体，但其实身处其中的每个个体的命运有着天壤之别。
People outside may think of Wuhan as a whole, but the fate of each individual in it is very different.
跟那些真正遭遇了不幸的人相比，秋秋觉得自己“连个炮灰也算不上，可能就是跑过去，镜头晃过一秒钟”。
"Qiuqiu felt that she was" not even a cannon fodder, maybe she was running over and swinging for a second, "compared with those who had really suffered.
。
.
“你就会想，这到底是真的吗？已经这样了吗？”秋秋说。
"You think, is this really true? Has it happened?" Qiuqiu said.
。
.
最近发生的事情令秋秋感到没有真实感。
Recent events have left autumn feeling unreal.
因为事先没有预料到会在武汉待上这么长时间，秋秋只带了一个MacBook回去，想着可以拿来写点东西，放放音乐，“里头没有任何游戏”。
Unexpecting to spend so much time in Wuhan, Qiuqiu returned with only a MacBook, thinking it could be used to write something and play music, "there's no game in it."
意外地留在了武汉以后，她的生活变得有点空虚。
After staying in Wuhan unexpectedly, her life became a little empty.
爷爷奶奶家里也没有Wi-Fi，她就只能玩玩手游，每天登录上去做一下日常。
Grandma and Grandpa don't have Wi-Fi in their house, so she can only play hand games and log in daily.
。
.
“一般情况下，我吃完了早饭以后就开始玩游戏，看看有什么能玩的……但是也没有什么特别能玩的。
"Normally, after breakfast, I start playing games and see what I can do... but there's nothing in particular.
”秋秋说，“你也知道手游很多时候做完了日常就没有什么可以做的，日常的任务也不是很花时间，我也不是那种很‘肝’的人。
"You know there are a lot of times when you're done with your hands, you don't have anything to do with your day-to-day tasks, you know, and I'm not a very 'liver' type of person.
”。
"
她有时候会不自觉地将周围发生的事情跟游戏里的体验联系在一起。
She sometimes unconsciously relates what happens around her to her experiences in the game.
“我会比平时急一点，比如以前抽卡比较随缘，但现在如果抽得稀烂，或者十连很’非’，我就会觉得，啊，就是这样啊，现在的环境都很差，武汉这个事情就已经很难过了，或许这段时间的运气就是不好吧。
"I will be more urgent than usual, such as the card more casual, but now if smoke diluted, or ten even very 'not', I will think, ah, that is, the environment is very bad, Wuhan this matter has been very sad, perhaps this time of bad luck.
”。
"
秋秋说：“感觉自己现在会比较相信命运这个东西了。
"I feel like I'm going to believe in fate now," Qiuqiu said.
”她觉得在这个特殊时期，游戏的意义也与平时有了一些不同。
She felt that the significance of the game at this particular time was a little different from what it usually was.
“在对未来不太确定的时候，游戏是一个有既定规则的世界，一个有付出就能够得到回报的世界。
"When in doubt about the future, the game is a world with established rules, a world where there are rewards to be had.
”。
"
在没有太多游戏可玩的日子里，秋秋最常用的缓解压力办法是看小说，但随着宅家的时间越来越长，这个办法也不再那么有用。
On days when there aren't many games to play, the most popular way to relieve stress in autumn is to read novels, but as homeowners get older, the technique is no longer so useful.
在北京的时候，她觉得自己还是蛮喜欢宅的那种人。
When she was in Beijing, she thought she was still quite a homebody.
“宅的前提是我不会觉得身体上有什么不适，但武汉这几天太冷了，家里又没有暖气……”秋秋告诉我，在大白天她甚至不能躺在床上，“因为爷爷奶奶会觉得没有到睡觉的时间就不能上床”。
"The premise of the house is that I don't feel any discomfort, but Wuhan these days is too cold and there is no heat in the house..." Qiuqiu told me that she could not even lie in bed in broad daylight, "because Grandma and Grandpa would feel unable to go to bed before bedtime."
。
.
在这样的家庭生活中，她会觉得很多时候心态没什么用。
In such a family life, she will feel a lot of time mentality is useless.
“就算心态崩了，也不会有太多人来关心。
"Even if the mentality breaks down, not many people will care.
尤其是我的家人，他们的亲情不会到关心我的心理状态这个层面。
Especially my family, their family will not care about my psychological state of this level.
所以，我的心态一直都是那种，明明心里已经慌得不行了，表面上依然很镇定。
Therefore, my mentality has always been the kind of, clearly in the heart has panic can not, the surface is still very calm.
”她告诉我，如果她在家人面前表现出慌张或者压抑的情绪，家人只会觉得，“你是不是想太多了”。
She told me that if she shows signs of panic or depression in front of her family, the family will simply say, "Don't you think too much."
。
.
有的时候，她会觉得自己的周围和外面的世界以及网络上的世界是割裂的。
At times, she feels that her world around her and beyond, as well as the world on the Internet, is fragmented.
她告诉我，她有个朋友家住在汉口靠近市中心的位置，“每天晚上都会听到车来车往，警车、消防车、救护车、大货车，各种各样的声音”。
She told me that one of her friends lived in Hankou, near the city center. "Every night she heard cars coming, police cars, fire engines, ambulances, lorries, all sorts of noises.
而她住在郊区，每天从早到晚都很安静，只是偶尔能听到飞机飞过头顶。
She lived in the suburbs and was quiet from morning till night, except for the occasional overflight.
。
.
至于网络上的东西，她也觉得心情复杂得很。
As for what was on the Internet, she too found it very complicated.
一方面，她觉得那是放大了的悲伤，“消化这些事情真的比较难”，另一方面，她明确地知道，这个城市有很多人都在跟痛苦打交道，她也会觉得有一点点庆幸，至少目前她和家人都躲过了一劫。
On the one hand, she felt that it was magnified grief, that "it was really difficult to digest these things," and on the other hand, she knew clearly that there were people in the city who were dealing with pain, and she would be a little lucky that she and her family had at least escaped the ordeal.
。
.
在这样的环境中，她感到格外孤独，“但我没有办法”。
In this environment, she felt particularly lonely, "but I have no choice."
她只等着疫情结束，先跟武汉的闺蜜约一个海底捞，“一起抱头痛哭一场”，然后赶紧回到北京，把台式电脑打开玩游戏。
All she had to do was wait for the outbreak to end, grab a boat ride with Wuhan girls, "cry together," and hasten back to Beijing to open the desktop for a game.
。
.
“让我充钱！让我充钱！”秋秋说。
"Let me recharge the money! Let me recharge the money!" Qiuqiu said.
。
.
秋秋的朋友给她发来下雪的北京。
Autumn and Autumn friends sent her a snowy Beijing.
石磊曾经是《家用电脑与游戏》的编辑，也是个老玩家，平日里每天固定打上两三个小时的游戏。
Once the editor of Home Computers and Games, Shi Lei is a veteran gamer who regularly plays games for two or three hours a day.
但在疫情爆发后，他迅速地失去了玩游戏的兴致。
But after the outbreak, he quickly lost interest in playing games.
他什么游戏机都有，每天只是挨个打开看一眼。
He has any kind of game console. He just looks at them one by one every day.
偶尔进游戏里漫无目的地转一转，或者在各个游戏机的商店里看看有什么在打折，但什么也没有买。
Take an occasional aimless stroll around the game, or look at the stores of the game machines to see what's on sale, but don't buy anything.
。
.
“不太能集中注意力，也不知道玩什么。
"Not too focused, not knowing what to play with.
”石磊告诉我，他之前喜欢玩赛车游戏，在家里坐着玩，戴着耳机，很多时候还会戴上一个赛车头盔，游戏体验很棒。
Mr. Shi told me he used to enjoy racing games, sitting at home, wearing headphones and, in many cases, a racing helmet.
“但你说让我现在去玩，我完全没有信心。
"But when you say let me play now, I have no confidence at all.
我不可能不去想现在周围的事情，我也没有办法告诉自己不去想。
I can't stop thinking about what's going on around me, and I can't tell myself not to think.
”。
"
他在PS4上很喜欢的游戏是《最后生还者》，平时没事的时候也会拿出来玩一玩。
His favorite game on the PlayStation 4 is "The Last Survivor," which he takes out when it's okay.
自从疫情开始，他就很不愿意玩这个游戏了。
He has been reluctant to play the game since the outbreak began.
“其实是个特别应景的游戏，本身讲的是一个与传染病相关的故事，讨论很多人性上的问题……但我现在每天都在经历过山车一样的体验啊。
"It was a special game, a story about infectious diseases and a lot of human problems... but I'm going through the roller coaster every day.
”石磊说，“所以心理上有点抗拒，不愿意再虐自己。
"So there's a bit of psychological resistance," said Shi.
”。
"
另一个现实的问题是，疫情改变了他的生活常态。
Another reality is that the epidemic has changed the way he lives.
没有疫情的时候，不想做饭就可以出去吃，但他现在每天到了点了就得做饭。
When there was no outbreak, he didn't want to cook and went out to eat, but now he had to cook every day when he arrived.
“我需要照顾我的家人，我不能让玩游戏影响我做饭。
"I need to take care of my family. I can't let playing games interfere with my cooking.
”石磊说。
"said Shi.
很显然，每天花在游戏上的时间就少了。
Obviously, there is less time spent on games every day.
。
.
他将这些内容都分享在朋友圈和微博上。
He shared it with friends and microbloggers.
“我也不觉得我的生活方式就是最好的，但至少是真实的。
"I don't think my lifestyle is the best, but at least it's real.
”他说，“武汉是什么样，我就给大家看是什么样。
"Wuhan," he said, "I will show you what Wuhan is.
如果有人在关注我的微博的话，我想让他们看到疫区里有一种生活是这个样子，让他们获得一些安慰。
If someone is watching my microblog, I want them to see what life is like in an infected area, and give them some comfort.
”。
"
石磊的小区封闭式管理后，业主和物业联合起来搞物资团购，他说他这几天的爱好变成了“蹲阳台上等待投喂”。
After Shi Lei's neighborhood was under management, the owner and the property joined together for a group purchase, which he said turned into "squatting on the balcony waiting to be fed."
“我相信大家肯定不愿意看到一个水深火热的武汉，我也相信大家肯定不愿意看到一个只有医院和求助信息的武汉。
"I believe that you do not want to see a hot water in Wuhan, I believe, I also believe that you do not want to see only a hospital and help information Wuhan.
”石磊说，“那些求助信息或许都是真的，但我还是想说，哪怕武汉有很多人在求助，还是有更多的人过着平凡的生活，我不希望剩下的这些人被情绪所主导。
"It may be true, but I would say that even if Wuhan has a lot of people asking for help, there are more people living ordinary lives, and I don't want the rest of them to be emotionally dominated.
”。
"
然而，无论如何调节，身处疫区中心的人们一定有着不同程度的情绪问题。
However, no matter how the regulation, people in the center of the epidemic area must have different emotional problems.
目前人们更关心具体事务的进展，包括物资、交通、设施等等，但他们在这段时间里积累下来的心理问题也是不容忽视的，在这些事情告一段落之后，可能会是一个需要漫长的时间才能愈合的疮口。
At present, people are more concerned about the progress of specific affairs, including goods, transportation, facilities, etc., but the psychological problems they have accumulated during this period cannot be ignored.
石磊也并不否认这一点。
Shi Lei does not deny this.
他告诉我，“现在武汉人肯定大面积存在着心理疾病”，因此，他也会有选择性地去看一些比较积极的新闻。
"Wuhan people must have a lot of mental illness now," he told me, so he would also selectively watch some of the more positive news.
。
.
“如果我每天还去看那些悲惨的新闻，我觉得人早就崩溃了吧。
"If I had been watching the sad news every day, I would have thought I would have collapsed.
再坚强的人也崩溃了。
Even the strongest man crumbles.
”石磊说，“绝望有用吗？我告诉你，这就是事实，绝望没有用的。
"Does desperation work? I tell you, that's the truth. Despair doesn't work.
如果你有一种绝望的情绪，你接下来要做什么？要么你去加入它、改变它，要么你就离开它。
If you have a feeling of hopelessness, what do you do next? Either you join it, change it, or you leave it.
你最需要做的是让自己变得强大起来，让自己身边的人，让你爱的人或者爱你的人过得更好。
What you need to do most is make yourself stronger, the people around you, the people you love, or the people who love you better.
”。
"
石磊在朋友圈里写道，“最近20天估计把未来人生所有的眼泪都流完了”。
"The last 20 days may have drained all the tears out of future life," Shi wrote in a circle of friends.
我问他是为了什么流的泪，他回答得很快，“是感动，不是伤心”。
I asked him for what shed tears, he answered quickly, "is moved, not sad."
他说这段时间里他最大的感受是，每一个独立的个体都在努力地生存，甚至在给予别人力所能及的帮助，他更多地看到——或者他更愿意看到那些“人性的光辉”。
He said his greatest feeling during this time was that every single individual was struggling to survive, even giving whatever help he could, seeing more - or that he preferred to see the "brilliance of humanity."
。
.
前两天，石磊发了一张从家里的阳台望出去的晴朗天空，他写道，“风雪之后也总有晴天，今天开始慢慢有心情能玩会儿游戏了”。
The other day, Shi Lian sent out a clear sky from his balcony. "There is always a sunny day after a snowstorm, and today he is in a slow mood to play games."
我记得他不久以前还有个说法，“生活是什么样的，取决于你怎么选择去生活”。
I remember him saying not so long ago, "What life is like depends on how you choose to live it."
。
.
我相信他是一个对生活拥有掌控感的人，或者至少是这样追求的。
I believe he is a man who has a sense of control over his life, or at least pursues it.
他告诉我，“在生活中肯定会遇到很多很糟糕的事情，这是一定会的，如果你天天觉得自己很糟糕，你就会不断地遇到很多糟糕的事情。
"There are going to be a lot of really bad things in life," he told me. "It's going to happen, and if you feel bad every day, you're going to have a lot of bad things going on.
所以，你不如无视这些糟糕的人和事，你可能反而会高兴一点。
So instead of ignoring bad people and things, you might be happier.
”在这场疫情的影响下，他变得更有意识地去寻找生活中的笑点和值得开心的事情。
As a result of the epidemic, he has become more conscious in his search for laughter points and things to be happy about in life.
。
.
石磊常常拍下从家里往外看的风景，他说“一天比一天美”。
Shilei used to take pictures of the scenery from his home, saying, "Every day is more beautiful."
灾难给人带来不幸，灾难也给人带来成全。
Misfortunes bring misfortune, and calamities bring fulfillment.
当石磊跟我讲起他如何被坚守的基层人员打动，如何对这个社会产生更多的情感和包容时，我倒想起《倾城之恋》的故事。
When Shi Lei told me how he was moved by the people at the grass-roots level and how he felt more emotional and tolerant towards the society, I thought of the story of Love in Town.
最后那一对情人正是因为灾难才得以结合，可我不觉得那是人性的光辉，反倒是跟“人”的本质相关。
The last pair of lovers were united by misfortune, but I felt it not so much in the glory of humanity as in the nature of man.
张爱玲是这么写的，“在这动荡的世界里，钱财、地产、天长地久的一切，全不可靠了。
Zhang Ailing wrote, "In this turbulent world, money, real estate, everything lasting forever, all unreliable.
靠得住的只有她腔子里的这口气，还有睡在她身边的这个人”。
The only thing to rely on was the tone in her voice, and the man who slept next to her.
。
.
不知道为什么，在写这篇文章的过程中，我的脑海里总是浮现出那只深夜狂奔在汉口二环高架桥上的野猪。
I do not know why, in the process of writing this article, my mind is always the late night rush on the Hankou two-ring viaduct on the wild boar.
这只野猪不知道自己要去哪儿，也不知道前方有什么在等待着它，只是一个劲儿地奔跑。
The boar did not know where he was going, nor did he know what lay ahead, just running.
这个场景击中了很多人的泪点，我想这种情绪绝不只是与武汉当下正在面临的困境有关，而是人们在这个小东西的身上体会到一种更底层、更普遍的感伤。
This scene hit many people's tears, I think this sentiment is not only related to Wuhan is now facing the plight, but people feel a lower level, more general sentimental.
。
.
这篇文章写的是武汉玩家的故事，它显然不仅仅关于游戏。
This article is about Wuhan gamers, and it is clearly not just about games.
游戏作为一个精神载体和文化切面，它试图讲述更大的主题：在这场灾难中，我们也有好多次得以窥见一种更本质的人，以及对人类共同命运的指向；而无论是好是坏，我们终究在各种各样的境遇里更加了解他人和自身。
Play, as a spiritual vehicle and a cultural dimension, tries to tell the larger story: many times in this disaster we have also been able to glimpse a more fundamental human being and the direction of the common destiny of mankind; and, for better or worse, we have come to know more about others and ourselves in all kinds of situations.
