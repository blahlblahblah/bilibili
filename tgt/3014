澎湃新闻特约撰稿 孙品烁邓宗宇/央视新闻当地时间3月5日18时，意大利民防部门负责人、新冠病毒应急委员会专员安杰洛·博雷利在例行疫情新闻发布会上表示，意大利现存新冠病毒感染肺炎病例为3296例，较前一日增长590例；死亡病例148例，较前一日增长41例；治愈病例414例，较前一日增长138例。
Italian civil defence chief Angelo Borelli said at a regular news conference that 3,296 cases of the new crown virus infection had been reported, 590 more than the previous day, 148 deaths had been reported, 41 more than the previous day, and 414 cases had been cured, 138 more than the previous day, CCTV news agency said.
该国目前累计新冠肺炎确诊病例达3858例。
The cumulative number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in the country now stands at 3,858.
5日，意大利西北部的瓦莱达奥斯塔大区首次报告两例病例，这也标志着该国20个大区已全部出现了新冠肺炎确诊病例。
On 5 May, two cases were reported for the first time in the Valleda Osta region of north-western Italy, which also marked the emergence of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in all 20 regions of the country.
在同一天，意大利总理孔特宣布，政府拨款75亿欧元用于支持该国的家庭以及企业应对疫情带来的紧急状况。
On the same day, Prime Minister Conte announced that the Government had allocated 7.5 billion euros to support families and businesses in the country to respond to the emergency created by the epidemic.
我叫孙品烁，今年27岁，在米兰理工大学读土木工程。
My name is Sun Pingshu, 27, studying civil engineering at Milan Polytechnic University.
去年12月底，我刚刚从季节性流感中恢复，看到国内新冠肺炎的消息也并没有多关注，以为只是普普通通的一次流感。
At the end of December, I had barely recovered from my seasonal flu, and the news of pneumonia at home had received little attention, assuming it was just an ordinary flu.
然而，短短半个多月的时间，风云突变。
In just over half a month, however, things have changed dramatically.
但那时，远在万里之外的意大利的我，没有感受到现实生活出现任何不同。
But back then, thousands of miles away in Italy, I didn't feel anything different.
第一次真正为疫情感到紧张是在1月23日的早晨。
The first real outbreak of tension was on the morning of January 23.
微博上有人爆料说，有来自武汉的旅行团当天早上抵达了米兰，并且有人已经出现咳嗽等疑似症状。
There were reports on Weibo that a tour group from Wuhan had arrived in Milan that morning and that people had developed suspicious symptoms such as coughing.
我在惊惶之下赶紧去买了口罩，戴着口罩等公交车时还有意大利大爷问我为什么要戴，是不是生病了。
I rushed to panic to buy masks, wearing masks and other buses and Italian uncle asked me why I wear it, whether sick or not.
接下来便是武汉“封城”，中国全国严阵以待。
Wuhan is the next "closed city," the whole country ready.
意大利这边，一对武汉的老夫妻1月30日在旅行途中被确诊，意大利也因此开启了为期6个月的国家紧急状态。
In Italy, a six-month state of emergency was imposed on an elderly couple who were diagnosed on their way to Wuhan on January 30.
本以为事情到此就收尾了，毕竟病人已经迅速被隔离，加上意大利的医疗水平国际一流。
This was supposed to be the end of the story, after all, the patient had been quickly quarantined, and Italy's medical standards were world-class.
“严防死守”下，我以为疫情不会在意大利进一步扩大。
"Strict defense" under the circumstances, I do not think the epidemic will further expand in Italy.
没想到的是，仅一周后，我成了疑似病例。
Unexpectedly, only a week later, I became a suspected case.
我从疫情旁观者变成了一线体验者2月7日早上，我出现了发烧的症状。
I went from being a bystander to being a first-hand experimenter. On the morning of February 7, I developed symptoms of fever.
由于两周前去机场接了刚从国内回来的女朋友，并且之前的流感结束后持续咳嗽了近两个月，为了稳妥起见，我拨打了意大利卫生部针对新冠疫情开设的专线1500，并前往位于莱科的亚历山德罗·曼佐尼（Alessandro Manzoni）医院急诊室就医。
As I picked up my girlfriend at the airport two weeks ago and had been coughing for nearly two months after the flu ended, to be on the safe side, I dialed the Italian Health Ministry's line 1500 for the New Crown Epidemic and went to the emergency room of Alessandro Manzoni Hospital in Lecco.
在听说我接触过从中国境内返回人员时，接诊医生大惊失色，直接给我开了黄色小条。
When I heard that I had come into contact with returnees from China, the attending doctor was shocked and wrote me a small yellow note.
在意大利的公立医院急诊室就医时，医生会给病人发放不同颜色的小条，红色为最危重，黄色次之，随后是绿色和白色。
In the emergency rooms of public hospitals in Italy, doctors give patients small strips of different colours - red is the most dangerous, yellow is the second, followed by green and white.
一般情况下，领到绿色小条要等待十小时左右才能被接诊。
In general, it takes about 10 hours to get a green note before you can be admitted.
这是我多年来首次体验到了意大利人的高效，从打电话一层层向上请示、安排我住入隔离病房、准备好核酸检测，这一切居然在半小时内就完成了！接着我忐忑不安地度过了24小时，期间得知我被隔离的同学们也有些许恐慌。
It was the first time in years that I had experienced Italian efficiency, from calling me up, placing me in an isolation ward, getting nucleic acid tested, and I spent 24 hours in trepidation, learning that my segregated classmates had a little panic.
如果那时我被确诊了，意大利的“1号病人”就不会是那位38岁带病跑马拉松的马蒂亚了。
If I had been diagnosed by then, Italy's "patient number one" would not have been the 38-year-old Martia, who ran a marathon with illness.
在隔离病房治疗当时我们也担心身边的一些意大利人会用不好的眼光来看待当地的华人和华侨。
Treating in the isolation ward was also a concern for some Italians around us who would see the local Chinese and overseas Chinese in a bad light.
所幸我最后核酸检测结果是阴性，第二天我被转到了普通病房。
Luckily my final nucleic acid test was negative, and the next day I was transferred to the general ward.
住院四天，医生始终没有查清楚我发烧和咳嗽的原因。
After four days in hospital, the doctor never found out the cause of my fever and cough.
隔离病房的伙食入院时，医生跟我说治疗是免费的，但我最后收到了一张费用高达1900欧元的帐单（约14000多元人民币）。
When the food in the isolation ward was admitted, the doctor told me that the treatment was free, but I finally got a bill for 1,900 euros (about 14,000 yuan).
因为我是留学生，每年要去续学生居留证，因此买了医疗保险。
Because I am an international student, I have to renew my student residence card every year, so I buy medical insurance.
在医院缴费处大妈的指导下，我去当地的卫生院办了医疗卡，再走医疗保险付了这笔钱，自己只掏了20欧元的材料费。
Under the direction of my mother at the hospital, I went to the local clinic to get a medical card and paid for it through Medicare at my own expense of only 20 euros.
病毒检测呈阴性的报告生活就是这么的奇妙，原本我抱着静观疫情形势发展的心态，突然就变成了疫情第一线的体验者。
The virus detection negative report life is so wonderful, originally I held the static epidemic situation development mentality, suddenly became the epidemic front-line experience.
不肯“吃亏”的酒吧业主和意甲联赛2月20日，首例新冠肺炎确诊病例在米兰附近的科多尼奥出现了。
The first confirmed case of New Crown Pneumonia has emerged in Cordonio, near Milan, on Feb. 20.
这位“1号病人”马蒂亚是个社交达人，新闻报道说，他在确诊前约半个月内参加了马拉松、球赛等多次参加聚集性活动，跑遍了10个城市，并在各种活动中接触了至少5万人。
The "No.1 patient," Matia, is a social guru who participated in marathons, tournaments, etc. for about half a month before his diagnosis, traveled to 10 cities and reached at least 50,000 people at various events.
从2月24日至25日的24小时之内，意大利确诊了超过100名病例，疫情迅速扩大，政府的反应不可谓不迅速。
More than 100 cases were diagnosed in Italy in the 24 hours from 24 to 25 February, and the epidemic spread rapidly, and the Government's response was not slow.
2月20日当天，疫情暴发地区的火车停开，政府两天内封锁了伦巴第大区的11个市镇，并且对米兰及其周边地区采用了宵禁政策，酒吧等营业场所晚上6点之后不得营业。
On 20 February, trains stopped in the outbreak area, the Government closed 11 communes in the Lombardy region for two days and imposed a curfew on Milan and its environs, barns and other places of business closed after 6 p.m.
疫情最严重的伦巴第大区和威尼托大区迅速宣布停课。
The regions of Lombardy and Veneto, where the epidemic was most severe, quickly suspended classes.
与之形成鲜明对比的是意大利普通民众的态度。
This contrasts sharply with the attitude of ordinary Italians.
首先是酒吧业主们，居然联合起来抗议宵禁政策，最后政府只得做出让步，允许晚上营业，但是要顾客间保持一定距离并且限制人数。
First, bar owners came together to protest against the curfew, and eventually the government had to make concessions to allow night operations, but with a certain distance between customers and limited numbers.
其次是普通市民，疫情扩大后，超市人头攒动，意面、水、面包、消毒用品被一抢而空。
Second, ordinary citizens, the spread of the epidemic, supermarkets swarmed, spaghetti, water, bread, disinfectant supplies were snatched up.
意大利面（pasta）中最先被抢完的果然是细面条（spaghetti）, 意大利人对它的爱最为深沉。
The spaghetti, which Italians love the most, was the first to be eaten in pasta.
疫情爆发后的esslunga超市，意面被抢光，剩下空心粉大街上能看到戴口罩的人清一色全是黄皮肤黑头发的同胞们。
After the outbreak of the outbreak of the esslunga supermarket, spaghetti was looted, leaving hollow powder streets full of yellow-skinned black-haired compatriots.
一来，市面上的口罩大多已经让华人收购寄回国内支援了；二来，兴许是文化的不同，大多数意大利人认为生病的人才戴口罩。
On the one hand, most face masks have been bought and mailed home by the Chinese; on the other hand, perhaps because of cultural differences, most Italians think sick people wear masks.
最关键的是，大多数人对于疫情的估计过于乐观，并没有意识到它的可怕。
Crucially, most people are over-optimistic about the epidemic and unaware of its horrors.
就以我的经历来说吧，因为咳嗽一直没好，我就自行前往药店买药，过程中药店的药剂师没有询问任何病症，偌大的药店也只有我一人戴着口罩。
In my case, I went to the drugstore to get medicine because my cough had been bad. The drugstore chemist did not ask any questions, and I was the only one wearing a mask.
贴着“口罩已售完”告示的药店最近两天意甲联盟对于意甲联赛的处理更是令人啼笑皆非。
The Italian league's handling of the Serie A league in the last two days is all the more ironic as the drugstore has put up a "sold-out" notice.
原定于3月1日在都灵打响的尤文图斯主场对阵国际米兰的“意大利国家德比”，最初意甲联盟决定在原时间空场举办，没过多久便改为推迟至3月2日，仅限皮埃蒙特大区的球迷进入观赛。
Juventus, who were due to open in Turin on March 1 for the first time against Inter Milan's "Italian national derby," initially decided to hold the game at a time when it was not long before it was postponed until March 2 for the benefit of the Piedmont fans.
原因仅仅是因为皮埃蒙特大区的第一条禁令只到3月1日为止，这样可以避免空场带来的门票损失，也难怪国际米兰的主席张康阳在Instagram上怒斥意甲联盟，表示健康因素应该放在首位，而不是门票等其他无关紧要的利益。
The reason is simply that the first ban in Piedmont ended on March 1, thus avoiding the loss of tickets to the stadium, and it is no wonder that Inter Milan President Zhang Kang-yang, on Instagram, lambasted the Italya alliance, saying that health considerations should come first, not other extraneous interests such as tickets.
民众渐渐有了防疫意识兴许是在经济、旅游业相继受挫，各方阻力的重压之下，前期反应灵敏的意大利地方政府于3月2日重新开放了米兰大教堂，佛罗伦萨宣布将于3月6日至8日免费开放公立博物馆，威尼斯政府更是要求当地酒吧免费提供开胃菜以刺激消费，全然不顾病毒专家的呼吁。
Italy's responsive local government reopened its cathedral on March 2, Florence announced the opening of a free public museum from March 6 to 8, and the Venetian government ordered local bars to serve appetizers free of charge to stimulate consumption, despite calls from viral experts.
意大利国家旅游局则在推特上表示，意大利是一个安全的国家，意外长迪马约更是呼吁别国解除对意大利航班的封锁。
The Italian National Tourist Office said on Twitter that Italy is a safe country and the unexpected long Dimayor calls for other countries to lift the embargo on Italian flights.
虽然意大利的医疗水平位居世界前列，但疫情爆发后医疗资源透支，使得医院只能收治有症状患者及重症患者，轻症及无症状阳性患者只能居家隔离。
Although Italy has one of the highest standards of care in the world, the overstretched medical resources following the outbreak left hospitals with only symptomatic and severe cases to be treated, and patients with mild and asymptomatic conditions had to be isolated at home.
在这种情况之下，有的同胞选择了转机回国，更多在意华人选择了深居简出。
In this case, some compatriots chose to turn the corner to return to China, more concerned about the Chinese chose to live in seclusion.
在口罩四处难求的局面下，米兰华人运营的外卖平台采用了“点外卖随单附送免费医用口罩”的方式做公益，我就是通过这个渠道拿到了一些口罩，避免了“裸奔”出门的险境。
As the masks became more difficult to get around, the Chinese-run takeaway platform in Milan adopted a "take-out with a free medical mask" approach, through which I got some masks and avoided the danger of leaving the house nude.
随外卖免费发放的医用口罩3月3日，意大利总理孔特签署了新的紧急法令，对红色区域（被封城的区域）和黄色区域（如米兰等疫情较为严重的区域）做出了新的规定。
Medical masks were distributed free of charge while on the take-out On March 3, Italian Prime Minister Kent signed a new emergency decree setting out new rules for red zones (closed areas) and yellow areas (such as Milan).
在口罩短缺的现实情况下，意大利政府呼吁没有感染区域的人没必要戴口罩是无奈之举。
In the face of a shortage of face masks, the Italian government has urged people not to wear masks in areas not affected by the disease.
周日的米兰地铁站之前网上曾有传言称意政府“只公布重症患者以免引起恐慌”，但事实证明这是谣言，每日的疫情信息仍然是公开透明地公布的。
Rumours on the internet ahead of Sunday's Milan subway station that the government "only announces patients in serious condition in order not to cause panic" proved to be a rumour, and daily information about the outbreak is still published openly and transparently.
公共交通并没有完全停止，但人流量的减少证明了普通民众也渐渐有了防疫的意识。
Public transport has not stopped completely, but the decline in traffic attests to the growing awareness of the general public.
我就读的米兰理工大学和其他大学也积极了开展网课教学。
The Polytechnic University of Milan and other universities I attend are also active in teaching online courses.
值此时刻，我们自身能做的也只能是少出门、戴好口罩，同时相信与等待意大利政府的防疫措施。
At this point, all we can do is to go out less, wear masks, and trust and wait for the Italian government to vaccinate us.
