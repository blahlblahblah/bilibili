澎湃新闻记者 刘栋岩田健太郎“你好，我是日本神户大学医院的传染病医学专家岩田健太郎教授，今天我进入了‘钻石公主’号邮轮，这艘船现在正遭受新冠病毒的大面积感染。
"Hello, I'm Professor Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital in Japan. Today I aboard the MV Princess Diamond, which is suffering from a massive infection with the new crown virus.
我在船上没有待满一天就被赶下了船，我将告诉你们我在船上看到的一切。
I was driven off the ship without a full day on board, and I'll tell you what I saw on board.
”2月18日晚，曾赴中国、非洲多国参与抗击SARS（非典型肺炎）病毒、埃博拉病毒的日本著名传染病学家岩田健太郎在他上传到社交媒体上的视频中讲述了在这艘邮轮上令人震惊的发现。
On the night of February 18, the renowned Japanese infectious disease scientist Kenshiro Iwata, who traveled to China and Africa to fight the SARS virus and Ebola, described a shocking discovery on the ship in a video he posted on social media.
从2月4日起，这艘停靠在横滨港，载有3700多人的“钻石公主”号邮轮，就一直是全世界关注的焦点。
The ship, with more than 3,700 people on board, has been the focus of world attention since February 4.
截至2月18日，船上已有542人经检测确诊感染了新冠病毒，接近船上总人数15%。
As at 18 February, 542 persons on board had been tested positive for the new crown virus, close to 15 per cent of the total number of people on board.
对此，外界广泛质疑为何这艘被隔离的邮轮上疫情在不断恶化？“‘钻石公主’号就是一台新冠病毒的生产机器。
"The Diamond Princess is the new Crown Virus manufacturing machine," she said, citing widespread questions about the worsening situation on the isolated liner.
在船上所看到的一切让我非常震惊，几乎要昏过去，在20多年的防疫工作经历中，我从未感到自己的感染风险如此之大。
What I saw on board was so shocking that I almost fainted. In more than 20 years of immunization, I never felt so exposed.
即使在非洲抗击埃博拉病毒与北京抗击SARS时，也没有那么令人恐惧。
Even when Africa fights Ebola and Beijing fights SARS, it is less frightening.
”岩田在视频中说道。
"Iwada said in the video.
16日晚，岩田健太郎在接受澎湃新闻采访时曾表示，在当下日本疫情升级的情况下，人们需要格外冷静应对。
In an interview with reporters Monday night, Iwata said people need to be calm in the face of the escalating epidemic in Japan.
他认为，“尽管目前日本疫情仍未发展到全国性蔓延的地步，病毒还不是无所不在，但我们必须努力减少日本国内感染者的数量，包括邮轮上的二次传播和医院内的感染，尽可能地封堵一切传播渠道。
"Although the epidemic in Japan has not yet reached national proportions, the virus is not ubiquitous," he said. "But we must try to reduce the number of people infected in Japan, including secondary transmission on cruise ships and hospital-based infections, and to block all transmission channels as much as possible."
”那么在“钻石公主”号邮轮上，岩田究竟看到了什么？艰难的登船岩田教授上传的视频共有两部分，其中一部分用英文录制，时长为12分钟。
So what did Iwada see on board the MV Princess Diamond? The gruelling Iwanda professor uploaded the video in two parts, some of which were recorded in English for 12 minutes.
另一段是用日语录制的，时长14分钟。
The other was recorded in Japanese and lasted 14 minutes.
在英文视频中，岩田首先解释了自己登上邮轮的“艰辛”过程。
In the English video, Iwata first explained his "arduous" journey aboard the ship.
一段时间以来，“钻石公主”号的感染迅速增加，外界一直质疑船上感染控制措施无法很好地发挥作用。
"The Diamond Princess" infection has been on the rise for some time, and questions have been raised that onboard infection control measures are not working properly.
非常关注邮轮感染情况的岩田从一些知情人士那边收到一些消息让他更加担心。
Iwada, who is very concerned about the ship's infection, has received some information from people familiar with the situation that has made him even more worried.
“他们告诉我：‘船上的人很害怕’，‘认为感染正在蔓延’。
"They told me, 'The people on board are scared,' and 'think the infection is spreading.
”岩田说道。
"said Iwada.
岩田花了几天时间与卫生部门的一名联络人联系，希望能够登上船。
Iwada spent several days contacting a contact person in the health department, hoping to board the ship.
他解释说，他想利用自己的专业知识来搞清楚为什么这么多人被感染。
He explained that he wanted to use his expertise to figure out why so many people were infected.
一位卫生官员17日打电话给他，告诉他可以进入邮轮做感染控制工作，但是随后他遭到总务省的“其他权力”阻止他进入该船。
A health official called him on the 17th and told him he could enter the ship for infection control, but he was then prevented from entering the ship by "other powers" of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
“我又接到一个警官的电话说有人不喜欢我，所以你不能上邮轮。
"I got another call from a police officer saying someone didn't like me, so you couldn't board the cruise.
他说不出是谁，也说不出为什么，但肯定是某种控制他的力量影响了他的决定。
He could not tell who it was or why, but it was some power of control that must have influenced his decision.
”岩田说。
"said Iwada.
最后，双方商议结果得出的办法是，岩田可以作为日本灾难医疗响应小组（DMAT ）的普通成员登船。
Finally, the two sides agreed that Iwada could board as an ordinary member of the Japanese Disaster Medical Response Team (DMAT).
但是他必须从事与灾难管理有关的“常规”医疗工作。
But he must do "routine" medical work related to disaster management.
岩田对这一限制表示不满意，因为这并非是他的专长。
Iwada expressed dissatisfaction with the restriction, as it was not his area of expertise.
“然而没有其他办法，我只能接受。
"There is no other way, however, than to accept it.
”他说。
'he said.
“完全的混乱”18日登上邮轮后，岩田查看了船内的几个地方，发现这艘邮轮在感染控制方面做得完全不够，甚至连基本的“绿区”（未被感染）和可能被病毒污染的“红区”都没有区分。
"Total chaos" after boarding the ship on the 18th, Iwata looked at several parts of the ship, found that the ship did not do enough to control the infection, even the basic "green zone" (uninfected) and the "red zone" that may be contaminated with the virus.
“人们穿着PPE（个人防护装备）到处走来走去，在同一个地方吃饭，甚至吃饭的时候还戴着防护手套。
"People walk around in PPE (personal protective equipment), eat in the same place and even wear protective gloves while eating.
现场完全的混乱，一些工作人员发烧了，他们去医疗中心时没有任何保护措施。
There was total confusion at the site and some staff members had fever and went to the medical centre without any protection.
医疗官员也没有保护自己，她甚至很高兴地对我说，她已经确认自己感染了，所以她完全放弃了保护自己。
The medical officer didn't protect herself either, and she even happily told me that she had confirmed that she was infected, so she gave up completely to protect herself.
”岩田在视频中描述道。
"Iwada described it in the video.
现场的一切让有着丰富传染病防控经验的岩田感到震惊。
Everything at the scene shocked Iwada, who had extensive experience in infectious disease prevention and control.
“20多年来，我处理过许多危险的感染场所，我在非洲处理过埃博拉疫情，我在另一个国家处理过霍乱疫情，2003年我在中国参与处理过SARS，我在那里见过许多发烧的病人。
"For more than 20 years, I have dealt with many dangerous infection sites, I have dealt with the Ebola epidemic in Africa, I have dealt with the cholera epidemic in another country, I dealt with SARS in China in 2003, and I met a lot of patients with fever there.
但是我从不担心自己会感染，因为我知道如何保护自己，如何保护他人，以及如何控制感染。
But I never worry about getting infected because I know how to protect myself, how to protect others, and how to control infections.
但在“（钻石）公主”号邮轮内，我非常害怕被新冠病毒感染，因为没有办法知道病毒在哪里。
But in the case of the Princess, I was very afraid of being infected by the new Crown virus because there was no way to know where it was.
没有绿区，没有红区，到处都可能有病毒，每个人都有可能不小心被它感染。
There is no green zone, no red zone, there may be viruses everywhere, and everyone can be accidentally infected by it.
”他说道。
'he said.
他继续说道，“船上没有专业的感染控制人员，也没有专业人员负责预防感染。
"There are no professional infection controllers on board," he continued. "There are no professionals on board to prevent infection.
官僚们负责一切，我和厚生劳动省的首席官员交谈过，他对我提出的保护船员和工作人员的建议非常不满。
The bureaucrats were in charge, and I spoke to the chief official of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour, who was very dissatisfied with my proposal to protect the crew and the staff.
”岩田建议，在不同人手中传递的一些问询表格纸张可能会造成传染，如果改成获得乘客口头同意，而非书面形式可能会更完全。
Mr Iwata suggests that some of the information forms handed over to different people may be contagious, and that it would be more complete if they were replaced by oral, rather than written, consent from passengers.
“我认为我的建议是合理的。
"I think my proposal is reasonable.
我没有对任何人大喊大叫，我没有批评任何个人，我试图提出建设性建议，以保护船上的每一个人。
I did not shout at anyone, I did not criticize any individual, I tried to make constructive suggestions to protect everyone on board.
”他说道。
'he said.
“顺便说一句，我一整天都没有喝过水。
"By the way, I haven't had any water all day.
每个人都在里面进食和喝水，但是我没有碰。
Everyone ate and drank in it, but I didn't touch it.
”他说道。
'he said.
“你必须出去”在当天大约五点钟的时候，检疫办公室的人要求岩田必须离开，“他们说我只是临时成员，显然我待在船上的许可被某人取消了。
"You have to go out" At about five o'clock that day, the Quarantine Office asked Iwanda to leave. "They said I was just a temporary member and obviously my permission to stay on the ship was cancelled by someone.
帮助我进来的负责感染控制工作的官员说他很抱歉，然后我反问他，你想怎么做，你想船上的每一个人都被感染吗？成千上万的人可能被新冠病毒感染。
The officer in charge of infection control who helped me in said he was sorry, and then I asked him what you wanted to do. Do you think everyone on the ship was infected? Thousands of people could be infected with the new crown virus.
”岩田说。
"said Iwada.
“很多专家来后待了几天就离开了。
"Many experts came and stayed for a few days before leaving.
他们说担心自己也会感染。
They say they're worried about getting infected.
我也有同样的恐惧，我也非常害怕自己感染，传给我的家人。
I have the same fear, I am also very afraid of their infection, passed on to my family.
”他说道。
'he said.
岩田表示，他原先以为肯定有一些专家被召集来负责船上的感染控制，令他没想到的是，没有人是专业的感染控制专家，只有官僚们在做完全外行的工作，违反了所有的感染控制原则，而船上的人冒着被进一步感染的危险。
Iwada said he had thought there must be some experts called in to take charge of infection control on board. To his surprise, no one was a professional infection control specialist, only bureaucrats were doing a completely layman's job, violating all infection control principles, while the people on board risked further infection.
”看到这一切后，对于每天有那么多病例新增我感到一点都不惊讶。
"Seeing all this, I was not surprised by the number of new cases every day.
”“我只是希望借此机会提出一个问题: 在过去两周，这艘邮轮船内究竟发生了什么？”他问道。
"I just want to take this opportunity to ask a question: What exactly happened on this cruise ship in the last two weeks?" he asked.
“因为在过去两周内，日本政府没有提供有关邮轮内部发生了什么的任何信息。
"Because over the past two weeks, the Japanese government has not provided any information on what happened inside the cruise ship.
”“呼吁日本改变”岩田在视频中说，他现在待在与家人隔离的单独房间里。
"Calls on Japan to change" Iwada said in the video that he is now in a separate room isolated from his family.
他还说，预计接下来的两周他将暂时进行自我隔离。
He also said he expects to temporarily isolate himself for the next two weeks.
岩田在视频结束时要求国际社会“呼吁日本改变”。
At the end of the video, Iwada called on the international community to "call on Japan to change."
他还呼吁为仍在“钻石公主”号上的人们提供更好的保护。
He also called for better protection for those still aboard the Princess Diamond.
“我希望国际机构要求日本作出改变。
"I want international institutions to demand change in Japan.
我希望每个人都呼吁保护‘钻石公主’号上的人。
I want everyone to call for the protection of the people on board the Princess Diamond.
否则，将会有更多的乘客感染。
Otherwise, there will be more passengers infected.
当在船上工作的人员回到陆地上，会成为一个很大的感染源（事实上已有工作人员确诊感染）。
When people working on a ship return to land, it can be a significant source of infection (indeed, the infection has been confirmed by staff).
对此，我不能忍受，我认为我们必须改变，我们必须对这些船员做些什么，我们必须帮助船上的人们，保护他们的安全和生命。
I can't stand that. I think we have to change. We have to do something about the crew. We have to help the people on board and protect their safety and lives.
”岩田呼吁道。
"he called.
对于在隔离过程中“钻石公主号”邮轮上疫情恶化的现状，厚生劳动省此前承认，邮轮上的预防措施可能无法完全发挥作用，需要继续分析病毒继续传播的原因。
The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour has previously acknowledged that preventive measures on board the vessel may not be fully functional and that the reasons for the continued spread of the virus need to continue to be analysed.
岩田博士的视频过去24小时内在社交媒体上得到了广泛的传播。
Dr. Iwata's video has been widely distributed on social media over the past 24 hours.
在推特（Twitter）上视频已经被分享了40000多次。
Video on Twitter has been shared more than 40,000 times.
著名的日本神经科学家茂木健一郎也在19日早些时候分享了这段视频，他说：“官员们没有回应，也没有收集他们应有的数据，而现在疫情已经开始流行。
"Officials did not respond and did not collect the data they were supposed to have when the epidemic began," said Koichiro Mauki, a renowned Japanese neuroscientist who shared the video earlier this morning.
”岩田发出的警告可能为时已晚。
Iwada's warning may be too late.
日本政府19日宣布，测试结果为阴性的乘客将于当天开始分批下船。
Passengers with negative test results will be disembarked in batches starting from the same day, the government said Tuesday.
就在此时，“钻石公主”号上首批乘客已经踏上了回家的路途。
Just then, the first passengers on board the Diamond Princess were already on their way home.
