“谁能想到疫情爆发在春节期间，我们该备的货已经备齐，给员工的年终奖也已经发完，公司的现金流不多了。
"Who would have thought that the outbreak of the epidemic during the Spring Festival, we should have the goods ready, to the end of the year for employees, the company's cash flow is not much.
”记者 | 刘娉婷实习记者 | 陶紫东编辑 | 王姗姗按马纪原先的设想，2020年的龙虾季“是要打一场翻身仗的”。
Ms Liu Ping-ting has served as an intern at Rita & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; Ms Wang & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
但新型冠状病毒疫情的爆发，彻底打乱了一切计划。
But the outbreak of a new coronavirus has completely disrupted all plans.
现在，作为上海网红龙虾店“沪小胖”的创始人，马纪什么都做不了，只能在家“干等着疫情过去”。
Now, as the Shanghai net red lobster shop "Shanghai Xiao Pang" founder, Ma Jiji can do nothing but "wait for the epidemic to pass" at home.
往年这时候，他已经在忙活着门店的工程检修、人员招聘，准备迎接3月之后龙虾旺季的到来。
By this time of year, he was already busy overhauling the store, recruiting staff and preparing for the lobster season after March.
经过16年的苦心经营，“沪小胖”在上海已经开出13家直营店。
After 16 years of painstaking management, "Shanghai Xiao Pang" has opened 13 direct shops in Shanghai.
食客们一年一个口味，龙虾在这两年的受欢迎程度也不比从前，马纪趁着冬天是龙虾淡季，刚投资了1000万元在上海和北京各开了一家新店谋求菜品转型，没想到突如其来的疫情，让新店的施工也卡在那里。
Lobster is not as popular as it used to be in these two years, when Ma Ji took advantage of the lean winter lobster season and invested $10 million to open a new store in Shanghai and a new restaurant in Beijing in search of food conversion.
而眼下对于马纪来说，更大的危机是公司的现金储备能在这种长期停业状态中维持多久。
For Mr. Ma, the bigger crisis is how long the company's cash reserves can stay in the long-term out of business.
沪小胖在大年二十五（1月19日）关闭了全部的门店，500多名员工休假回家过年。
Shanghai Xiao Pang in about 25 (January 19) closed all stores, more than 500 employees took leave home for the New Year.
现在，除了马纪自己回到上海，其他员工基本都被困在老家。
Now, with the exception of Ma, who returned to Shanghai himself, most of the other employees are stranded in their home towns.
马纪没想到“疫情会恶化的这么快。
Ma did not expect "the outbreak will worsen so quickly.
”沪小胖在大年二十五（1月19日）关闭了全部的门店，至今未恢复正常营业。
Shanghai Xiao Pang closed all its stores on January 19 and has yet to resume normal business.
13家直营店，单日的租金及人工成本就是10万元，堂食没生意零收入的局面持续上一个月，这份“固定开支”就是300多万元，一分也不能少。
13 direct shops, a one-day rent and labor costs of 100,000 yuan, canteen food did not have a zero income situation for a month, this "fixed expenditure" is more than 3 million yuan, no less than a cent.
“西贝说它能撑三个月，但像我们这样的中小微企业，都不一定能撑到那时间。
"Sebastian says it will last three months, but MSMEs like us won't make it through that time.
”马纪对《第一财经》YiMagazine说。
"Ma told First Finance Yi Magazine.
电影春节档全部被取消的同时，餐饮业盼望大赚一笔的“春节档”，在今年也同样颗粒无收。
While the Spring Festival holiday season has been canceled, the restaurant industry is looking forward to making a big profit on the Spring Festival holiday.
2月1日，西贝餐饮董事长贾国龙对媒体诉苦，受疫情影响，预计春节前后的一个月将损失营收7亿至8亿元。
Feb. 1, Xibei restaurant chairman Jia Guolong complained to the media, affected by the outbreak, the Spring Festival is expected to lose between 700 million yuan and 800 million yuan.
全国60多个城市400多家西贝筱面村的堂食业务基本已暂停，只保留了100多家外卖业务。
More than 400 villages in more than 60 cities around the country have basically suspended their Tang Feeding business, retaining only more than 100 takeaway businesses.
在恒大研究院近期发布的《疫情对中国经济的影响分析与政策建议》报告中显示，对比2019年除夕至正月初六，全国零售和餐饮企业实现销售额约10050亿元，而今年同期餐饮零售的收入预计将不足去年的一半，仅有5000亿元。
According to a recent report by the Hang Seng University Research Institute on Impact Analysis and Policy Recommendations on the Chinese Economy, retail and catering companies nationwide realized sales of about 105 billion yuan between New Year's Eve 2019 and early January 6, while catering and retail revenue is expected to be less than half that of last year, at just 500 billion yuan.
生意突然停摆2019年年底，全国火锅连锁餐饮大龙燚还举办了一场斗志昂扬的年终总结会，董事长柳鸷如约给员工发完了年终奖金，并在年会上向员工勾画了2020年美好的蓝图——投资1000万元在成都建设一座新工厂，在全国继续拓展50家加盟店……“员工们当晚都很开心。
Business suddenly stopped at the end of 2019, Chinese hotpot chain Dalong had a spirited year-end wrap-up meeting, at which the chairman, Liu Heng, delivered his annual bonus to employees, and outlined his vision for 2020 -- $10 million to build a new factory in Chengdu and continue to expand 50 franchises across the country.
接下来，就要准备迎接春节聚餐高峰期的到来。
Next, must prepare to welcome the Spring Festival gathering peak arrival.
但没想到整个春节会变成这样。
But did not expect the whole Spring Festival will become so.
”柳鸷对《第一财经》YiMagazine说。
"insidious," he told First Finance Yi Magazine.
抛开一片惨淡的春节生意，这场疫情发生的时间点，是让柳鸷最委屈的地方，“谁能想到疫情爆发在春节期间，我们该备的货已经备齐，给员工的年终奖也已经发完，公司的现金流不多了。
Leaving the bleak Spring Festival business behind, this outbreak comes at a time when hate is insidious: "Who would have thought that during Spring Festival we had everything we had to stock up and end-of-year bonuses for our staff and the company's cash flow was running short."
”成立于成都的大龙燚目前在全国拥有近300家门店，其中含子品牌在内共11家直营店。
The Chengdu-based Dragons currently has nearly 300 stores across the country, including 11 direct shops, including its sub-brand.
1月25日，成都市市场监督局、商务局联合发布通告，为了防控疫情蔓延，禁止本市举办群体性餐饮经营活动，解禁时间另行通知。
On January 25, the Chengdu Market Supervision Bureau and the Commercial Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice prohibiting the city from organizing mass catering activities in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
1月26日，大龙燚旗下所有直营门店全部进入闭店状态，随后，全国各地的加盟店也相继停止营业。
On January 26, all the direct-market stores under the Dalong umbrella went out of business, followed by franchises across the country.
去年正月初一至初九，大龙燚11家直营门店的堂食营业额高达499万元，而今年只有32万元，下降超过9成。
From January 1 to 9 last year, Tai Lung has 11 direct shops with a turnover of 4.99 million yuan, down more than 90% from 320,000 yuan this year.
大龙燚每个月的房租加物管费需要110万元，税金20万元，正常运营的能源费60万元左右，360多名员工的工资成本是170万元。
Dragons pay 1.1 million yuan per month for rent plus materials, 200,000 yuan for taxes, 600,000 yuan for normal operations and 1.7 million yuan for 360 employees.
“还好我们留了1000多万元准备建厂的钱，加上之前正常运营留下的几百万元现金储备，大概能撑一段时间。
"Fortunately, we have more than 10 million yuan set aside to build the plant, plus millions of dollars in cash reserves left over from normal operations, which will probably last for some time.
”柳鸷预计，包括加盟店受到的冲击、供应链业务的停工，今年整个上半年公司很有可能都没有收入。
Mr Liu expects that the company will likely lose revenue throughout the first half of the year, including the impact on its stores and the shutdown of its supply chain business.
大龙燚门店内，员工开工前测量体温。
Staff take temperature before starting work in Tai Lung Choi Shop.
在上海已经慢慢发展出19家直营店的川味宵夜品牌红料理，“大年初五全部恢复营业”的计划也全部泡汤了。
In Shanghai, 19 direct shops have slowly developed the Sichuan-flavor brand red food brand, the "year of May all the resumption of business" plans have also been ruined.
初五那天，红料理品牌总监赵蓉去门店给在岗员工拜年，店内所有的椅子都背面朝上盖在桌子上——那是过去每天凌晨4点门店打烊后做清洁时才会看到的样子。
On the fifth day, Zhao Rong, the director of the red-food brand, paid a New Year call to the staff at the store. All the chairs in the store were covered with back-to-back covers on the table - what they used to see after the store closed at 4 a.m. for cleaning.
还有越来越多返乡的店员告知公司，当地的村子已经封路，可能没有办法按照原定计划初五回到门店上班。
An increasing number of returning shop assistants informed the company that the local village had been closed and might not be able to return to work on the fifth day as originally planned.
“当时的第一反应就是，人员回不了岗怎么办？还有为了保证食材的新鲜，正常情况下食材市场每天都要供货到门店，年后是否能恢复正常的供应也是问题。
"The first reaction was that people couldn't get back to work, and in order to keep the ingredients fresh, the food market would normally go to stores every day, and it was questionable whether normal supplies would return to normal after that.
”直到初五，红料理只能先开放了14家门店的外卖业务，加强安全措施，等待堂食恢复。
Until the fifth day of junior high, red cuisine was able to open only 14 take-out stores, tighten security and wait for the parlour to recover.
自救刻不容缓柳鸷回忆称，从堂食业务彻底闭店开始，他最多的时候一天要开5场会。
He can't wait to help birds of prey, he recalls, recalling that he was up to five times a day since the restaurant was closed.
“很多业务曾经不管的现在都要管起来，包括人员的排班、外卖业务以及安抚加盟商等。
"A lot of business that once didn't work now has to be managed, including scheduling, taking out and mollifying franchises."
”这两天，柳鸷已经和一位房东谈妥，对方愿意减免一个半月的租金，其他的还在沟通中。
He has two days with a landlord to cut his rent for a month and a half, and others are still in communication.
“如果不能谈减免的话，心里最差的预计是直接关掉两家效益不好的门店，因为房租实在太贵了。
"If you can't talk about relief, the worst thing you can expect is to shut down two inefficient stores because the rent is too expensive."
”免除房租，对于短期零收入的餐饮企业是一种最直接的援助。
Rent waivers are the most direct aid to short-term zero-income restaurants.
1月26日，保利商业发布公告称，全国旗下22家购物中心年初一至初六期间，减免品牌商户6天租金。
On January 26, Poly Commercial announced that the country's 22 shopping centers between the first day of the first to the sixth day of the six-day rent relief.
1月28日，万达商管集团宣布，将对各地所有万达广场的商户的租金及物业费实行全免政策，预计将减免租金30亿至40亿元。
On January 28, Wanda Commercial Management Group announced that it would implement a rent-free policy for all Wanda Plaza tenants and property management fees, with an estimated rent reduction of between $3 billion and $4 billion.
龙湖集团也宣布旗下商场商户减租2个月。
Longhu Group also announced that its shopping mall business rent reduction 2 months.
人员调配上，大龙燚现阶段只保留64名员工，负责三个外卖站点的制作与配送，采用轮岗的制度。
On the deployment of personnel, Dalong stage only retained 64 staff, responsible for the production and distribution of three take-out sites, using the system of rotation.
为了节省开支，大龙燚采用按照比例的方式发放薪酬。
To save money, Dalong takes a pro-rata approach to pay.
根据疫情期间每月人力成本只能占据日常运营成本的一半的原则，员工当下只能拿到一部分比例的薪水，如果营业恢复正常，会将缺失的薪水补发给员工。
Based on the principle that monthly labor costs account for only half of daily operating costs during an epidemic, employees now receive only a fraction of their salaries, and if business returns to normal, the missing salaries are redistributed to employees.
其中，在家休息的员工，将按成都最低保障收入1200元/月发工资，总监级别以上的员工获得应得收入的60%，一线员工获得应得工资的90%，而董事会成员全部停薪。
Among them, employees who stay at home will be paid 1,200 yuan per month at Chengdu's minimum guaranteed income, 60 per cent at the director level and above, 90 per cent at the frontline level, with all board members without pay.
“外卖是我唯一能够想到的增量。
"Take out is the only increment I can think of.
”柳鸷透露，大龙燚有三家生意较好的直营门店从2016年开始涉足外卖，在今年初一到初十期间外卖收入为181万元，同比增长547%。
Mr Liu says three of Darren's better-selling direct stores have dabbled in takeaway since 2016, with 1.81 million yuan ($1.81 million) in revenue for the first 10 years of the year, up 547% year on year.
为了拉动外卖业务的销量，大龙燚发动全体员工通过朋友圈推广火锅外卖产品。
To boost take-out sales, Dalong takes out all its employees through a network of friends to promote takeaway products.
如果订单量大，大龙燚还将继续增加外卖业务的站点。
If the order volume is large Dalong will also continue to increase the take-out business site.
门店无法正常营业，外卖业务是许多餐饮企业的唯一增量。
Shops can't operate normally, and take-out is the only increment in many restaurants.
红料理在春节期间组成了应急小组，物资采购的周期原本为每日直送，受限于原产地特产食材供应短缺问题，导致食材损耗和缺货都很严重，每天的营业时间缩短了两小时，一旦货品不足，还要随时调整外卖菜品。
Red cuisine formed an emergency response team during the Spring Festival. The procurement cycle, which was originally a direct daily delivery, was constrained by a shortage of special-origin food supplies, which led to high levels of wastage and stock-outs, reduced daily business hours by two hours and adjusted take-out whenever items were insufficient.
原先负责堂食的员工临时转岗负责后厨清洁或者外卖打包，扩大配送员的数量。
The staff who used to be in charge of the parlour were temporarily reassigned to clean or pack the back kitchen and expand the number of distribution staff.
不过，红料理品牌总监赵蓉仍然认为，如果餐饮企业的堂食部分长期不能开业，只能依靠外卖，必然会形成一个不健康的财务模型。
However, Zhao Rong, the brand director of red cuisine, still believes that if catering enterprises can not open part of the restaurant for a long time, can only rely on take-out, will inevitably form an unhealthy financial model.
况且目前很多小区执行封锁政策，降低了消费者点外卖的便捷度，对外卖的订单量也造成了不小的影响。
Moreover, the implementation of the current closure policy in many small areas, reduce the convenience of consumers take-out, the volume of external sales has also had a considerable impact.
柳鸷则介绍说，并非所有的餐厅都可以在短时间转型外卖，“跑流程大概就需要半个月的时间，外卖的设备加上包装也需要投入10万元左右，如果单量不先跑起来，不是会死的更快嘛。
birds of prey are not all ready to switch to takeaway in a short time, 'says Liu.' It takes about half a month to run, and equipment and packaging for take-out can cost around $100,000.
”已经等不来“黎明”1月31日，阿里本地生活公司发布《给所有商家伙伴的一封信》，对全国所有口碑商家免除佣金至2020年2月29日，年费延期，推出“外卖极速上线服务”，商家提交申请当日就开通外卖业务等政策扶持。
"Dawn" January 31, Ali's local life company issued a "Letter to All Business Partners," waiving commissions to all word-of-mouth businesses nationwide until February 29, 2020, extending the annual fee and introducing "take-out service," which enables businesses to open takeout services and other policies on the same day they submit their applications.
但餐饮企业更期待饿了么和美团外卖能够在武汉之外，在更多城市实施阶段性降低佣金的政策，以帮助这些目前仅剩外卖业务的企业可以渡过疫情难关。
But do restaurants expect more hunger and take-out from the U. S. Mission to implement a phased reduction in commissions in more cities outside Wuhan, to help these companies, which are only now taking out, tide over the epidemic.
上海一家经营夏威夷海鲜盖饭的网红餐厅Poke Lab在2月3日通过自己的微信公众号宣布“0元转让”。
Poke Lab, a Shanghai-based dinning restaurant selling Hawaiian seafood, announced the "0 yuan transfer" on February 3 through its own microphone public sign.
Poke Lab是由两个从苹果公司辞职创业的姑娘在2017年创办。
Poke Lab was founded in 2017 by two girls who quit Apple to start their own business.
她们曾体会过苹果零售店非常注重顾客体验的那一面，从人民广场一个只有14平方米的小店做起，对这番创业曾满怀憧憬，通过真材实料也很快树立了品牌口碑。
They've seen Apple stores take the customer experience very seriously, starting with a small 14-square-meter store in People's Square, which they have long dreamed of, and have quickly built a brand reputation with real material.
因为使用大量进口生鲜食材，从客单价上已经决定了Poke Lab的商业模式只能属于“小众网红餐厅”。
Because of the use of large quantities of imported raw food, the unit price of the customer has decided that Poke Lab's business model can only belong to the "small crowd red restaurant."
截止2019年年底，它只有两家门店。
By the end of 2019, it had only two stores.
据创始人刘佳介绍，生意最好的时期，两家店的月度营收可以做到30万元，毛利率则可以达到70%。
According to founder Liu Jia, the best period of business, the two stores can achieve monthly revenue of 300,000 yuan, gross profit can reach 70%.
但餐饮素来是一门现金流生意，对于小微规模的餐饮品牌来说，更是要对各项支出都得精打细算，而一场疫情则可以轻易击垮它脆弱的现金周转能力。
But catering has always been a cash-flow business, especially for smaller, smaller food brands, which can easily overwhelm its fragile cash-flow capacity with a single outbreak.
疫情对小微规模餐饮品牌而言更是一场大考。
The epidemic is a major test for small and micro food brands.
积累了7000多个会员的Poke Lab，往年春节长假一结束便会迎来它的经营旺季。
Poke Lab, which has more than 7,000 members, is expected to hit its peak season once the Spring Festival holiday ends.
但今年已经长达20天的餐厅“0收入”局面，直接导致Poke Lab对于日益临近的去年12月和今年1月的商铺租金账期，已经无力支付。
But the 20-day restaurant's "zero revenues" situation this year has directly contributed to Poke Lab's inability to pay for the increasingly close months of December and January.
再加上店员中有老家在温州的，也有回湖北过年的，能否及时复工都是疑问。
In addition, there are shop assistants back home in Wenzhou, there are back to Hubei Spring Festival, whether the timely resumption of work is a doubt.
尽管外卖渠道获得的流水收入也曾占到Poke Lab一家店的三分之一，但刘佳评估后还是认为，如果转型只做外卖并不现实。
While take-out outlets also used to generate a third of the revenue generated by a store in Poke Lab, Ms. Liu's assessment is that it wouldn't be realistic to switch to takeout.
首先，和物业方签订长租合同的门店不可能被马上关停，其次外卖平台抽佣比例高，比如饿了么对Poke Lab订单的抽点达到20%，加之还要花钱做线上流量，“如果单做外卖的话，每个月没有多少盈余的，做不好还会亏。
First, stores with long-term leases cannot be shut down immediately. Second, there is a high percentage of take-out commissions, such as hungry 20% on Poke Lab orders, plus spending money on online traffic.
”“现在上海有很多网红餐厅的老板，都在看天过日子。
"" There are a lot of net-red restaurant owners in Shanghai right now, living on the sky.
”刘佳对《第一财经》YiMagazine说，她和几个合伙人讨论后，最终决定放弃这场创业，提出0元转让的目的是为了可以尽可能继续保留餐厅品牌。
Ms. Liu told First Finance Yi Magazine that after discussions with several partners, she finally decided to abandon the venture, citing a 0-yuan transfer to keep the restaurant brand as long as possible.
而接盘方需要马上支付的成本，只是那笔即将逾期的房屋租金。
The immediate cost to the receiver is just the rent for the house that is about to expire.
“我们不想直接就把店关掉，因为毕竟从我自己的角度上讲还是挺有感情的，我觉得如果它能活下去，这个是最好的，很多顾客也是很喜欢我们产品的。
"We don't want to just shut it down because it's still emotional from my own point of view, and I think if it survives, this is the best, and a lot of customers like our product.
”刘佳说，她希望能把Poke Lab托付给一个手上有很多钱的人，可以有实力让餐厅再次“活蹦乱跳地出现在顾客面前”。
Ms. Liu said she hoped to entrust Poke Lab to someone with a lot of money and the ability to "bounce back in front of customers".
