记者/郭慧敏 实习记者/胡琪琛编辑/计巍 宋建华武汉市中心医院举办的义诊活动中的江学庆在患者眼里，江学庆温暖到了极致。
Reporter / Guo Huimin Intern / Hu Qi Chen Editors / Jianhua Wuhan City Central Hospital Jianghua Wuhan Medical Clinic JiangXueqing in the eyes of patients, Jiang Xueqing to the extreme warmth.
秋冬时候问诊，江学庆怕自己手凉，总会搓暖了再去接触患者的脖子，遇到过于焦虑与恐惧的患者他也从不急躁，会幽默安慰：如果人这一生总要过这个关的话，患甲状腺癌是最好的，因为这个癌最“懒”，只要治好基本就没事了。
When asked for treatment in autumn and winter, Jiang Xueqing was afraid of his cool hands, always rubbed his neck and then touched the patient's neck. He would never be impatient and would be humorous and comforting.
3月1日，这位“最亲切”的“60分贝暖医”因新冠肺炎离世。
The "most affectionate" 60-decibel warm doctor died of pneumonia on March 1.
当天上午，武汉中心医院官方微信发布公告称，武汉市中心医院甲状腺乳腺外科党支部书记、主任、主任医师、中国医师奖获得者江学庆，在抗击新冠肺炎疫情工作中不幸染病，经全力抢救无效，于3月1日凌晨5点32分在武汉市肺科医院去世。
On March 1, 2006, Wuhan Central Hospital issued an official notice announcing that Jiang Xueqing, secretary, director, chief physician and Chinese physician award winner of the Thyroid Breast Surgery Department of Wuhan Central Hospital, died on March 1 at 5.32 a.m. at Wuhan City Lung Hospital.
大约五小时前，江学庆的女儿江紫妍收到武汉市中心医院打来的电话，医生在电话中告诉她父亲江学庆病情突然恶化，需要抢救。
About five hours ago, Jiang Ziyan, Jiang's daughter, received a call from Wuhan Central Hospital. The doctor told her father that Jiang Xueqing's condition had suddenly deteriorated and needed to be rescued.
彼时，江学庆已经使用体外膜肺氧合（俗称“人工肺”，主要用于对重症心肺功能衰竭患者提供持续的体外呼吸与循环，以维持患者生命，以下简称ECMO ）33天，身体条件很差，抢救人员到最后曾通过每10分钟打一次肾上腺素的方式，试图挽回江学庆的生命，可惜以失败告终。
At that time, Jiang Xueqing had used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (commonly known as "artificial lung") to provide continuous external respiration and circulation to patients with severe cardiopulmonary failure (ECMO) for 33 days.
“他是那么强大的一个人，我从没想过他会倒下，变成那个样子。
"He was such a strong man that I never thought he would fall down and become like that.
”江紫妍说。
"said Jiang Ziyan.
在她心中，父亲拥有魔法，能让接触他的所有人感到心安。
In her heart, her father has magic, can let all who touch him feel at ease.
“他以前常跟我说有爸爸在，什么都不用怕，只要开心就好了，但现在他走了……”张朝阳是江学庆的同学兼同事，当得知好友在工作岗位上染病时，张朝阳既觉得惋惜，又觉得是一名医生的职责所在，“我不觉得医生是英雄，即使是，也是被逼着当的。
"He used to tell me that there was a father, nothing to be afraid of, just happy, but now he left..." Zhang Chaoyang is a classmate and colleague of Jiang Xueqing.
”江学庆的去世让张朝阳有种无法掌控自己命运的感觉，总觉得“灾难”随时可能落到任何一个人身上。
Jiang's death left Zhang with the feeling that he had no control over his fate and that "disaster" could fall on anyone at any time.
江学庆和病人在一起持续五小时的抢救3月1日零时，江紫妍收到武汉市中心医院打来的电话，医生在电话中告知她父亲江学庆病情突然恶化，“当时说他血压往下掉的很厉害，专家进行了紧急会诊，然后大概十二点半开始抢救。
Jiang Xueqing and the patient together for five hours rescue March 1 0, Jiang Ziyan received a call from Wuhan city central hospital, doctors told her father Jiang Xueqing's illness suddenly deteriorated, "At that time said his blood pressure fell down very bad, experts had an emergency consultation, and then about 12: 30 began rescue.
”彼时，江紫妍的母亲已经休息，因为心绞痛等疾病，她在睡前服用过安眠药，没想到错过了医院的电话。
"At that time, Jiang Ziyan's mother had taken a rest, because of angina and other diseases, and she had used sleeping pills before going to bed.
江学庆是武汉市中心医院甲状腺乳腺外科（以下称甲乳外科）主任，1月17日，始终坚守在一线岗位的他确诊感染新冠肺炎。
Jiang Xueqing, director of thyroid breast surgery (hereinafter called nail surgery) at Wuhan Central Hospital, was confirmed to be infected with New Crown Pneumonia on January 17, having stayed at the front line of his post.
当天他给女儿发微信告知了自己确诊的消息，并说得了这个病情况可能会很不好。
That day he sent a message to his daughter to inform him of the diagnosis, and said the condition could be very bad.
江紫妍猜想，即使是身为医生的父亲，面对新冠肺炎，他内心肯定也是感到恐惧的。
Jiang Ziyan guessed that even as a doctor's father, in the face of the new crown pneumonia, he must feel the fear.
她回忆，1月13日父亲已经有了低烧和拉肚子的症状，但他说自己只是着凉了，再加上父亲患有胆结石和胃溃疡，家人都以为拉肚子是这两种疾病的反应，并没有联想到新冠肺炎。
On January 13, she recalls, her father had a low fever and diarrhea. But he said he had only a cold. Coupled with his father's gallstones and stomach ulcers, his family thought diarrhea was a reaction to the two conditions and did not associate it with pneumonia.
“那时候爸爸还在坚持看诊，说第二天有重要的病人，已经答应了要亲自给人家做手术，所以不能休息。
"At that time my father was still attending the clinic and said that the next day there were important patients who had promised to have surgery themselves, so they could not rest.
”同在武汉市中心医院工作的张朝阳是江学庆的大学同学，他回忆自己与江学庆的专家门诊同在13日，江学庆当时已经开始发热，但看完门诊之后并未休息，反而接连做了几天手术。
Zhang Chaoyang, who also works at Wuhan Central Hospital, a college student in JiangXueqing, recalled that he and Jiang Xueqing had been having an expert consultation on the 13th.
江紫妍后来听父亲同科室的同事说，17日，父亲开会时已经站不住了，才去拍片子做了检查，并于当天确诊新冠肺炎。
Jiang Ziyan later listened to his father and colleagues said, 17, when his father was unable to stand at the meeting, only to make a film for examination, and confirmed the same day New Crown Pneumonia.
确诊第二天，江学庆病情突然加重，第三天就用上了无创呼吸机，第四天转入武汉中心医院呼吸科ICU ，张朝阳称江学庆的感染情况比同医院的李文亮医生还要严重。
The day after the diagnosis, Jiang Xueqing's illness suddenly aggravated, on the third day with a non-invasive ventilator, the fourth day to Wuhan Central Hospital Respiratory Unit ICU, Zhang Chaoyang said that Jiang Xueqing's infection than the hospital's Dr. Lee Wenliang more serious.
武汉中心医院医生陈琦推测，江学庆的感染应该和接诊病人有关，因为医院离华南海鲜市场较近，且他的病人多、门诊量大。
Chen Qi, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, speculated that Jiang's infection should be related to receiving patients, as the hospital is closer to the south China seafood market and his patients are numerous and outpatient.
1月22日，江紫妍收到医院通知，说父亲病情很严重需要转院，需要家属签转院同意书。
January 22, Jiang Ziyan received a hospital notice that his father's serious illness needs to be transferred to hospital, families need to sign consent to transfer.
“我们在感情上无法接受，好好的一个人才两天时间，你跟我说他病得很严重......”江紫妍与姑姑一起来到医院商量转院事宜，医院领导向其说明了病情变化、转院利弊之后，征得了她的同意。
"We are emotionally unacceptable, a good person for two days, you told me that he was seriously ill..." Jiang Ziyan and his aunt came to the hospital to discuss the transfer, the hospital leadership explained to him the changes, the advantages and disadvantages of the hospital, after her consent.
两小时之后，江紫妍和姑姑在武汉中心医院门口见到了父亲——两米之外，父亲带着呼吸机面罩，闭着眼皱着眉。
Two hours later, Jiang and aunt met her father in front of Wuhan Central Hospital - two meters away, his father wearing a respirator mask and frowning with closed eyes.
此时距离江紫妍上一次见父亲已经过去18天。
It was eighteen days since Jiang Ziyan had last seen her father.
自从疫情爆发、江学庆开始一线的救治工作之后，与家人就再没碰过面。
Since the outbreak of the outbreak, JiangXueqing began first-line treatment work, and family members have never met.
“他是那么强大的一个人，我从没想过他会倒下，变成那个样子。
"He was such a strong man that I never thought he would fall down and become like that.
”27日，因为治疗需要，已经气管插管的江学庆开始使用ECMO，并在此后的33天，都没能离开这个急救设备。
Jiang, who had already had his trachea intubated, began using ECMO on February 27, unable to leave the emergency equipment for 33 days.
江紫妍回忆，3月1日的抢救大约持续了五小时，期间她一直和医院保持联系。
Jiang recalled that the March 1 rescue lasted about five hours, during which she was in constant contact with the hospital.
过程中，医院曾打来电话说所有的抗生素基本都用过了，并没有明显效果。
In the process, the hospital had called to say that all the antibiotics were basically used, no obvious effect.
最后医院传来消息，只能通过每10分钟打一次肾上腺素的方式，试图挽回江学庆的生命，可惜以失败告终。
Finally, the hospital news, can only be played every 10 minutes through the adrenaline, trying to save Jiang Xueqing's life, unfortunately ended in failure.
“我爸爸用ECMO的时间实在太长了，抢救的时候身体条件已经很差，再说不停打肾上腺素人也很痛苦。
"My dad used ECMO for so long that he was already in poor physical condition when he was rescued, and it was painful to keep hitting adrenaline.
”当日凌晨5点32分，55岁的江学庆在武汉市肺科医院去世。
Jiang Xueqing, 55, died at 5: 32 a.m. in Wuhan City Lung Hospital.
因为出嫁后仍和父母同住一个小区，江紫妍先是给母亲打了电话，随后马上赶到家中陪伴。
Because she still lived in the same neighborhood as her parents after her marriage, Jiang Ziyan first called her mother and then rushed home to accompany her.
平时因为母亲身体不好，父亲感染新冠肺炎后的相关事宜都由江紫妍负责，关于父亲的病情她也总是选择性地告诉母亲，但这一次的消息，没了任何选择的余地。
Usually due to her mother's ill health, Jiang Ziyan was responsible for all matters related to her father's new crown pneumonia. She always told her mother selectively about her father's condition, but this time the news left her with no choice.
工作时的江学庆60分贝暖医“暖”几乎是所有患者对江学庆的一致评价，就连医院在举办义诊活动时，也会在江学庆的名牌上多打几个字：60分贝暖医。
At work, Jiang Xueqing 60 decibels warm medical "warm" is almost all patients of JiangXueqing's unanimous evaluation, even when the hospital organized free clinic activities, will also in Jiang Xueqing's famous brand-name play a few words: 60 decibels warm medicine.
江学庆在问诊时有个原则——说话音量要尽量控制在60分贝以下，且要注意措辞和语气，尽量为患者营造舒适的就诊环境。
Jiang Xueqing in the treatment of a principle - to speak as much as possible under 60 decibels, and pay attention to the wording and tone, as far as possible for patients to create a comfortable medical environment.
他还规定科室所有医护人员，一律不许对患者大声说话或态度急躁。
He also stipulates that all medical personnel in the department are not allowed to speak loudly or impatiently to patients.
杨思雨是江学庆的患者之一。
Yang Siyu is one of Jiang Xueqing's patients.
2018年夏天，杨思雨患了乳腺结节，辗转几家医院得到的答案都是需要做手术，在犹豫不决想详细询问医生建议时，得到的回复往往是：要么做手术，要么自己想别的办法。
In the summer of 2018, Yang Siyu suffered from breast nodules and was referred to several hospitals for surgery. When he hesitated to ask his doctor for detailed advice, he was often told that either he needed surgery or he could think of something else.
最后她来到武安市中心医院，挂了江学庆的专家号。
Finally she came to the central hospital in Wuan City and hung up the expert number of Jiang Xueqing.
问诊的时候，杨思雨问为什么微创手术还要全麻？麻药会不会让人变傻？面对一连串的问题，江学庆没有半点急躁，反而幽默回应：不全麻的话，你一紧张坐起来怎么办，而且你这么聪明不会傻的。
When asked for medical treatment, Yang Siyu asked why the minimally invasive surgery and general anesthesia? Can anesthetics make people silly? In the face of a series of questions, Jiang Xueqing is not impatient, but humorous response: If not, how do you sit up nervously, and you are not stupid.
手术后，杨思雨问护士几天可以出院，护士回答江医生的病人出院很快，不会乱开药。
After the operation, Yang asked the nurse if he could leave the hospital in a few days. The nurse answered that Dr. Jiang's patient was discharged quickly.
回忆起这些，杨思雨说：“他是我遇到过最亲切的医生。
"He is the kindest doctor I have ever had," Yang said, recalling these words.
”秋冬问诊时，江学庆怕自己手凉，总会搓暖了再去接触患者的脖子。
"When asked for treatment in autumn and winter, Jiang Xueqing was afraid of his cool hands, always rubbing warm before touching the neck of the patients.
张怀庆是个甲状腺癌患者，她第一次见到江学庆是2016年夏天。
Zhang Huaiqing, a thyroid cancer patient, first saw Jiang Xueqing in the summer of 2016.
当时江学庆刚下手术，还穿着手术衣就过来看诊，摸了一下张怀庆的喉咙，看到对方一脸紧张，还拍着她的肩膀用武汉话说：“丫头别担心，不是多大个事儿，既然是个不好的东西（肿瘤），我们把它摘了就行了。
Jiang Xueqing just after the operation, but also wearing surgical clothes to see the doctor, touch Huaiqing's throat, see each other a tense face, also patted her shoulder and said in Wuhan language: "Don't worry, girl, it is not a big thing, since it is a bad thing (tumor), we just take it off.
”张怀庆问：“很严重吧？”江学庆点点头说：“肯定是不好的，但是不怕，有我在一定会根据你的个人情况想出一个最好的、最合理的手术方案，我做过好多这样的手术，都恢复得很好，特别是像你这样的年轻人。
"Zhang Huaiqing asked:" Very serious? "Jiang Xueqing nodded to say:" Certainly not good, but I will certainly according to your personal circumstances to come up with a best, most reasonable surgery, I have done so many such surgery, all very well, especially young people like you.
”听了这番话，张怀庆很快放松下来。
"Hearing this, Huaiqing quickly relaxed.
江学庆紧接着又说：“如果人这一生总要过这个关的话，患甲状腺癌是最好的，因为它最安全，这是一个很懒的癌症，只要治好基本就没事了。
"If a person has to pass this test in his whole life, thyroid cancer is the best, because it is the safest, it is a very lazy cancer and it will be all right once it is cured," said Jiang
”她回忆，当时江学庆还跟她聊了许多生活琐事，“那样的交流让我有一种错觉，好像我们不是第一次见面的医生跟病人。
Jiang, she recalls, also talked to her about the details of life. "It gave me the illusion that we were not doctors and patients when we first met.
”“而且在他的‘熏陶’之下，他们整个科室（甲乳外科）都很温暖。
"" And under his influence, the whole department [breast surgery] was warm.
”手术之后张怀庆需要隔一段时间来复查一次，因为江学庆比较忙，她挂了其他医生的号。
Zhang Huaiqing needed to come back at regular intervals after the operation because Jiang was busy and she hung up other doctors' numbers.
但她发现，不管是哪位医生，沟通时都很温柔，对病人也很呵护。
But she found that no matter who the doctor was, communication was gentle and caring for the patient.
在她看来，一定是个人有足够的“魅力”，才使得整个团队都能达到这样的水平。
In her view, it must be an individual with enough "charisma" to bring the whole team to this level.
得知江学庆去世的消息之后，杨思雨一时恍惚，脑海中一下子满是江学庆开玩笑的样子，她不敢相信，马上去微博和武汉市中心医院的微信公众号确认消息，才不得不接受事实。
After hearing the news of Jiang Xueqing's death, Yang Siyu was in a trance, her mind filled with jiangxue joking. She could not believe that she had to go to Weibo and Wuhan Central Hospital to confirm the message before she had to accept the facts.
她觉得很心痛：国家培养一个医生需要那么多年，却在一场战役中，可能因为没有铠甲被感染，实在不应该。
She felt heartache: it takes so many years for the state to train a doctor, but in a battle it may not be appropriate to be infected without armour.
她甚至在想，用那么多优秀的一线医务人员的生命去换普通人的生命，到底值不值？生活中的江学庆“不负责任”的父亲在江紫妍印象里，父亲总是在上班，待在家里的时间很少，从小到大，她见到父亲的机会始终不多。
She even wondered whether it was worth trading the lives of so many excellent front-line medical workers for the lives of ordinary people.Jiang Xueqing's irresponsible father in Jiang Ziyan's impression was that his father was always at work and spent little time at home.
江紫妍上小学时，江学庆曾到黄冈市英山县扶贫，“那是个连饭都吃不饱的地方，但他还是去了。
When Jiang Ziyan went to primary school, Jiang Xueqing went to Yingshan County in Huanggang City to help the poor.
”两年后，扶贫归来的江学庆决定去美国深造，还曾把妻女接到美国短暂生活。
"Two years later, Jiang Xueqing, who returned from poverty alleviation, decided to go to the United States to study.
2006年，江学庆回国，开始在武汉中心医院甲乳科当主任，将科室的病床从几张床发展到后来的一两百张床。
In 2006, Jiang returned to China and began to work as a director of the department in Wuhan Central Hospital, developing beds from several beds to one or two hundred later.
张朝阳称当时的江学庆可谓是“白手起家”，并把这个科室经营成武汉市属医院里的“绝对的第一名”，“他还是甲乳全国唯一一个中国医师的获得者，就他一个。
Zhang called Jiang Xueqing "self-made" and made the department the "absolute first place" in Wuhan city hospital. "He was also the only Chinese doctor in the whole country and he was the only one who got it
”江学庆是个内敛的人，几乎不和家人提起工作，但偶尔也会卸下铠甲，和家人谈起自己。
Jiang is an introverted man who hardly talks about work with his family, but occasionally takes off his armor and talks about himself to his family.
江紫妍记得有一次做错事惹父亲生了气，他把她叫到身边说：“爸爸也好难，好难。
Jiang Ziyan remembered that he had done something wrong to anger his father. He called her to him and said, "How difficult it is for father.
”如今回想起这些往事，江紫妍泣不成声。
"Now, looking back, Jiang Ziyan sobbed.
在这个三口之家里，作为父亲和丈夫的江学庆没能挪出多少时间陪伴家人。
In the family of three, Jiang Xueqing, father and husband, was unable to spare much time to spend with his family.
妻子曾问他：为什么要对医院、对科室和病人那么负责任，付出那么多，说句有私心的话，医院又不是自己家的，迟早不都要退休的吗？江紫妍称，一般这个时候，父亲不会做任何回答。
His wife had asked him why he was responsible to the hospital, to the department and to the patient, and if there was so much to say, the hospital was not in his own house, and sooner or later he would retire, said Jiang.
“我知道他是放心不下，他把科室里的每个医生护士都当成自己的孩子”，江紫妍说父亲“就是操心的命”，医院对他来说早就已经成为割舍不了的一部分。
"I know he's worried. He treats every doctor and nurse in the department as his own child." Jiang said his father was "worried about life," and the hospital had long been an inseparable part of him.
在她看来，拼命工作是父亲生活中的常态，胆结石和胃溃疡都是工作以后得的。
Hard work was the norm in her father's life, and gallstones and stomach ulcers were acquired after work, she said.
江学庆在学校时曾是足球队的一员，身体素质很好，但成为医生之后，作息、饮食都要依患者、看诊、手术而定。
Jiang Xueqing was a member of the football team at school. He was in good physical condition, but after he became a doctor, his diet and rest depended on the patient, the consultation and the operation.
“我们整天跟他说要好好吃饭，但他每次都要把病人都看完才吃，病人那么多怎么看得完，有时候一个紧急电话又要上手术台......”武汉中心医院医生吴杰称，江学庆的工作量一直很大，甲乳外科每天大概有二三十台手术，大多数病人都是找江学庆的。
"We talked to him all day long about having a good meal, but every time he finished reading the patient and seeing so much, sometimes an emergency call had to go to the operating table," said Wu Jie, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital.
张朝阳回忆江学庆看门诊时，正常看诊时间应该是从早上8点到中午12点，但他经常忙到下午两三点钟，一上午要看一百多个病人，每次都要把病人看完再吃饭。
Zhang Chaoyang recalls that Jiang Xueqing visits the clinic, the normal consultation time should be from 8 a.m. to 12 noon, but he is often busy until two or three o'clock in the afternoon, the morning to see more than a hundred patients, each time to see the patient before eating.
江学庆最常说的话就是“没事，没问题”，在病人因为病情焦虑时他会这样说，在家人因为琐事困扰时也会这样说。
The most common thing Jiang says is "nothing, no problem," he would say when the patient is anxious about his condition, or when his family is bothered by trifles.
他总能让人心安——在江紫妍看来，这是一种父亲独有的“魔法”，哪怕是刚刚接触的病人，听到父亲说没问题，仿佛就真的觉得没问题。
He was always reassuring - a sort of "magic" that Jiang Ziyan thought was unique to his father, even if he heard his father say no problem.
“他以前常跟我说，有爸爸在什么都不用怕，只要开心就好了，但现在他走了，我以后该怎么办？”但江紫妍知道自己必须要赶快撑起来，她的身后还有需要安慰的母亲以及九旬的爷爷奶奶。
"He used to tell me that having a father didn't have to be afraid of anything, as long as he was happy, but now that he was gone, what should I do next?" But Jiang knew she had to stand up quickly, and behind her was a mother in need of comfort and her grandparents in their nineties.
江学庆去世之后，江紫妍拿到了父亲的手机，她发现，父亲在确诊的第二天（1月18日）曾给爷爷奶奶录过一个视频，他在视频中说：“儿子这么大了还不懂事，都没有时间陪陪爸爸妈妈，这次我一定会争气挺过来，等病好了腾出时间好好陪你们。
When Jiang Xueqing died, Jiang Ziyan got her father's cell phone and found out that her father had recorded a video to her grandparents the day after the diagnosis (Jan. 18). "My son is not old enough to spend time with his parents.
”同一天，江学庆还发微信叮嘱女儿：近期不准到处跑。
The same day, Jiang Xueqing also sent a message to her daughter: "No running around in the near future.
江学庆正在为患者做手术（右一）“被逼着当英雄”父亲被宣布抢救无效死亡之后，江紫妍在父亲的同学群里发布消息：谢谢大家这么长时间给予我爸爸和我的关心和帮助，我爸爸刚刚还是没能挺过来，感染太严重，每十分钟一支肾上腺素才勉强维持血压，他走了也是解脱，再次谢谢大家。
Jiang Xueqing is operating on the patient (first from the right) After his father was declared a hero and died, Jiang Ziyan announced in the crowd of his father's classmates: Thank you for giving my father and me so much care and help.
微信发出之后，群里被流泪和蜡烛的表情刷屏。
After the message was sent, the group was swept by tears and the expression of the candle.
“除了这个，还能说什么呢，我之后一定会去参加他的葬礼”，作为江学庆的同学兼同事，张朝阳说，自己确认这个信息的时候已经“麻木”，从2月初开始，群里就一直有关于江学庆病情的讨论，一下子说他要抢救，一下子又说他要走了。
"Apart from this, I will definitely go to his funeral," said Zhang Chaoyang, a classmate and colleague of Jiang Xueqing. "Since the beginning of February, the group has been discussing Jiang's illness.
张朝阳曾给江学庆发微信：“外面有各种传闻，你现在到底怎么样？”但迟迟没有等来回复。
Zhang Chaoyang sent a message to Jiang Xueqing: "There are various rumors outside, you now exactly how?" But did not wait for a reply.
“我知道他坚持得太难，也知道我们院李文亮走了以后，下一个很可能就是他，因为病情太严重”。
"I knew he was too hard to insist on and that after our hospital Li Wenliang left, he would probably be next because he was too ill."
张朝阳早就为江学庆的病情担忧难过。
Zhang Chaoyang has long been worried about Jiang Xueqing's illness.
“第一次见到他的CT片子时，一下子眼泪就流出来了。
"The first time I saw his CT scan, tears came out of his eyes.
”张朝阳和江学庆之间的友谊已有39年，相互合作得十分默契，很多从甲乳外科转到张朝阳科室的病人都找他来看诊。
Zhang and Jiang Xueqing have been friends for 39 years and have worked closely together, with many patients who have moved from breast surgery to Zhang's department looking for him.
好友在工作岗位上染病，张朝阳觉得惋惜，但又是职责所在，“我不觉得医生是英雄，即使是，也是被逼着当的。
Zhang Chaoyang felt sorry for his friend's illness at work, but it was his duty. "I don't think a doctor is a hero, even if he is forced to.
”张朝阳称武汉中心医院已经有几百个医护人员感染新冠肺炎，但具体数量不清楚。
Zhang said several hundred hospital staff had contracted pneumonia at Wuhan Central Hospital, but the exact number was unclear.
目前医护人员需要轮换岗位，因为长期面对新冠疫情，他们的身体和心理都承受极大压力，且随着时间的推移，感染风险会越来越高，另一方面外地医疗队进驻中心医院，也在一定程度上缓解了救治压力。
At present, medical staff need to rotate their positions, as they are under intense physical and psychological stress due to a prolonged period of exposure to the new crown, which increases the risk of infection over time, while the presence of field medical teams in the central hospital has also somewhat eased the burden of treatment.
江学庆的去世让张朝阳有种无法掌控自己命运的感觉，他回忆前段时间上班，大家最关心的就是今天又有几个同事感染了，每天平均有多少同事会被感染，总觉得“灾难”随时可能落到任何一个人身上。
Jiang's death left Zhang with the feeling that he could not control his own destiny. He recalled the days before when he went to work. The main concern was that a few co-workers were infected today.
