万博新经济研究院院长滕泰对第一财经表示，从2月17日起，疫情对经济的影响进入下半场，企业复工、复产条件好转，复产复工速度显著加快。
Teng Tai, director of the Huambo New Economic Research Institute, told First Finance that since February 17, the epidemic's impact on the economy has entered the second half.
七成企业复工前程无忧的调查显示，复工企业数量正在快速增长中，从第一周的53%上升到71.8%。
A survey of 70% of businesses returning to work shows that the number of businesses returning to work is growing rapidly, from 53% in the first week to 71.8%.
从行业来看，金融业复工比例最高为89.2%，零售业88.3%，医疗行业86.7%，制造业72.3%，物流业67.8%，房地产业52.3%。
In terms of industry, the proportion of workers returning to work was 89.2 per cent in finance, 88.3 per cent in retail trade, 86.7 per cent in health care, 72.3 per cent in manufacturing, 67.8 per cent in logistics and 52.3 per cent in real estate.
从企业类型看，国有企业复工最早，到岗上班比例最高，员工保障条件也相对较好；互联网行业复工比例最高，目前在家上班的比例高达92%。
According to the type of enterprises, state-owned enterprises are the first to return to work, have the highest proportion to work, and have relatively good security conditions; the Internet industry has the highest proportion of workers returning to work, with 92 per cent currently working from home.
同时，大型企业复工比例最高，受访企业中员工规模在2000人以上的复工比例达到84%，员工人数在100人以内雇主复工仅占47%。
Large enterprises also had the highest proportion of workers returning to work, with 84 per cent of those with 2,000 or more employees and 47 per cent of those with fewer than 100 employees returning to work.
工信部数据也显示，全国规模以上工业企业复工率逐步提高，其中浙江已超过90%，江苏、山东、福建、辽宁、广东、江西已超过70%。
Figures from the Ministry of Industry and Communications also show that the reactivation rate of industrial enterprises above the national scale has gradually increased, with Zhejiang Province accounting for over 90 percent, and Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Liaoning, Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces exceeding 70 percent.
而中小企业开工率仅接近30%。
The start-up rate for SMEs is close to 30%.
前程无忧首席人力资源专家冯丽娟表示，对多数企业而言，复工也许并非难事，但复工之路可能长达数月。
Fung Lijuan, chief human resources expert, said it might not be difficult for most companies to get back to work, but the road back to work could take months.
企业招聘同步增长与复工同步，企业用人的需要开始增长。
Synchronization of recruitment growth and return to work, the needs of enterprises began to grow employment.
2月10～21日，前程无忧招聘岗位增加了57万个（一个岗位可能招聘多人），同期投递简历的人数已经超过500万。
Feb. 10-21 saw an increase of 570,000 jobs (possibly more than one), with more than 5 million CVs submitted over the same period.
2月17～2月21日招聘岗位增幅最快的来自制药/生物工程、医疗设备/器械和快速消费品(食品、饮料、化妆品)，增幅分别比2月10～14日增加了58%，39%和32%。
The fastest growth in recruitment from 17 February to 21 February came from pharmaceutical / biological engineering, medical equipment / devices and fast-moving consumer goods (food, beverages, cosmetics), which increased by 58 per cent, 39 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively, from 10 to 14 February.
然而，与去年相比，企业的用人需求明显下降。
Compared with last year, however, there has been a marked decline in the demand for employees.
社会招聘量计划与去年持平和增加的雇主占到57%，暂缓招聘的雇主也占到12%。
The share of employers with social recruitment plans remaining the same and increasing over the previous year was 57 per cent, as were 12 per cent of employers with deferred recruitment.
新增职位数量和简历投递人数是上一年同期的31%和45%。
The number of new jobs and resumes was 31 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, over the same period the previous year.
调查报告称，招聘量减少并不意味着人才获得变得容易。
The report says a drop in hiring does not mean it is easier to get talent.
事实上，社会招聘“候选人不足”困扰着现在急于用人的雇主。
Indeed, a "shortage of candidates" for social recruitment is plaguing employers who are now eager to hire.
首都经济贸易大学中国新就业形态研究中心主任张成刚对第一财经表示，目前就业面临主要问题还是跨省人员流动存在障碍，即使采用“点对点”直达运输方式主要保障重点企业用工，各省大范围铺开成本依然高，下一步要尽快解决劳动者流动以及流动后无法返岗的困局。
Zhang Chenggang, director of the Center for Research on New Employment Patterns at the Capital Economics and Trade University, told First Finance that the main problem with employment is the barrier to cross-provincial mobility.
在接受访问的3850名员工中，渴望恢复日常工作的受访个体占 54.5% ，远大于“不想工作” （6.9%）与“仍不敢复工”（14.5%）的总和。
Among 3,850 workers interviewed, 54.5 percent said they were anxious to get back to work, much more than "6.9 percent" and "still don't dare to return to work" (14.5 percent).
制造业恢复快于服务业这份调查还显示，目前的企业经营几乎都处在“支出大于收入”的阶段，有34%的企业现金流仅能维持1~3个月，21%的企业为3~6个月，8.6%的企业为6~12个月，31.3的企业为一年以上。
The survey also showed that almost all businesses are now operating at a "spending over income" stage, with 34% cash flow for only 1-3 months, 21% for 3-6 months, 8.6% for 6-12 months, and 31.3% for more than one year.
对于经营的全面恢复，半数以上的雇主认为“一年内可见”。
More than half of employers said a full recovery was "visible within a year."
不同行业受疫情的冲击程度不同，恢复速度也不同。
Different industries are affected by the epidemic to varying degrees and at different rates of recovery.
万博新经济研究院最新发布报告称，从结构上看，在经济总量中占比达53%的服务业，不仅受疫情受冲击最大、恢复速度慢，且有些行业的损失不能在下半年弥补，预计服务业2020年一季度增速为-0.1%，上半年增速约为3.7%。
The services sector, which accounts for 53 per cent of the economy, is structurally hardest hit and recovering at a slower pace, according to a new report by the Huambo Institute for New Economics, which is expected to grow by -0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 and 3.7 per cent in the first half of the year.
其中，餐饮住宿业受冲击最大，预计一季度增速-45.7%，全年增速-11%。
Among them, the hotel industry was the hardest hit, with -45.7% growth for the first quarter and -11% for the whole year.
滕泰表示，从非典经验来看，制造业恢复也是快于服务业，当前制造业复工速度也大于服务业，预计一季度制造业还将正增长。
Mr Tent said the recovery in manufacturing was also faster than in services in the light of the SARS experience and that manufacturing was now returning to work faster than services, with positive growth expected in the first quarter.
因此，下一步“稳增长”的重点应该是服务业。
So the next step in "steady growth" should focus on services.
滕泰建议，货币政策应尽快宣布降准、降息，切实降低企业融资成本；财政政策则要用创新办法打开收支空间，可以加大国有企业分红力度，若按2019年国企利润50%分红，可增加非税收入1.3万亿元。
Mr Tent suggested that monetary policy should announce a reduction in interest rates and interest rates as soon as possible, effectively reducing the cost of financing for enterprises, while fiscal policy should use innovative ways to open up revenue and expenditure space, increase the dividend of state-owned enterprises and increase non-tax revenue by 1.3 trillion yuan.
