我是一名在武汉工作的普通高校教师，爸妈也在武汉工作。
I am an ordinary college teacher who works in Wuhan. My parents also work in Wuhan.
在1月23日之前，我从没想过今年家里会遇到这样的灾难。
It never occurred to me before January 23 that this would happen to my family this year.
这几天，是我人生三十余年最难熬的时间。
These days have been the most trying period of my life in more than thirty years.
本来应该欢喜迎春，却不料因为疫情的扩展，在武汉和老家湖北当阳相继封城后，我和患病的家人两地分隔。
Should have welcomed the spring, but because of the spread of the epidemic, Wuhan and his hometown of Hubei Dangyang, after the closure of the city, I and the sick family separated.
没有公交车，妈妈借三轮车把爸爸推进医院1月14日左右，听妈妈说爸爸有点儿感冒，拖了两天去武汉市第十一医院检查，发现肺部有些阴影，但因为各项指标都是正常的，医生也没说什么。
On January 14, my mother said my father had a slight cold, so I went to Wuhan Eleventh Hospital for two days to check up on his lungs. However, the doctor said nothing because the indicators were normal.
他们俩也没当回事，就回家了，当感冒静养。
Neither of them took it seriously, so they went home to rest when they had a cold.
爸妈已经买好了1月24日回老家当阳过年的车票，商量之后，我先于1月20日回到老家，照顾爷爷奶奶，准备过年的相关事宜，等爸妈年三十这天再一起团聚。
After discussing it, I returned to my hometown on January 20 to take care of my grandparents, prepare for the New Year and wait for my parents to get together again on January 30th.
然而连续几天下来，情况迅速恶化，武汉医院里的资源不够用了。
However, over the next few days, the situation rapidly deteriorated, Wuhan hospital resources are not enough.
我爸每天发烧，却无法在医院确诊是否是新型肺炎，更没办法住院治疗。
My father had a fever every day, but was unable to confirm in the hospital whether the new pneumonia, more can not be hospitalized.
妈妈每天在医院排号，一站就是大半天，两人从上午一大早挨到下午才能轮上打一针。
Mother platoon in the hospital every day, a station is half a day, the two from the early morning until the afternoon before the wheel to hit a shot.
■父亲在医院。
▪ Father is in hospital.
1月23号，武汉宣布封城，全城公交停运。
January 23, Wuhan announced the closure of the city, the city's public transport stopped.
从家到医院，平时仅仅两三公里的路程，成了难题。
From home to the hospital, usually only two or three kilometers away, has become a problem.
爸爸由于过度虚弱，已经没办法走路去医院了。
Dad was too weak to walk to the hospital.
叫不到车。
Can't get a car.
我们甚至打遍了120、110和119，要么长时间占线，要么因为没有防护装备不敢接送。
We even went through 120, 110 and 119, either because the line was busy for a long time or because there was no protective equipment to pick them up.
无奈之下，我妈从附近借了一辆三轮车，把爸爸扶上去躺着，自己再推着车走到医院去，排队给爸爸打针。
In desperation, my mother borrowed a tricycle from nearby, help my father to lie up, pushed his car to the hospital, lined up to give his father injection.
妈妈冒着被感染的风险，每天焦急地在医院门口排队，在老家的我，却只能心急如焚，抛开所谓的脸面，向所有的亲友、领导求助。
At the risk of infection, my mother anxiously queue in front of the hospital every day, in my hometown, but I can only be distraught, put aside the so-called face, to all friends, leaders for help.
夜深时，心里无法平静，担心妈妈被感染，担心爸爸不能继续坚持下去。
Late at night, unable to calm down, worried about the mother infected, worried that the father can not continue to insist.
每敲一行字，三十多岁的我都忍不住流下难过的泪水，只恨平时陪他们太少，自以为是太多。
Every stroke of the word, I can not help but shed tears of sadness, only hate to accompany them too little, self-righteous too much.
爸爸说：“医院里环境太差，我自己很害怕。
"The environment in the hospital was so bad that I was scared," he said.
”1月24日上午，我爸在医院拿到了入院单，但是没有床位，仍然无法入住。
On the morning of January 24, my father received his admission ticket at the hospital, but there were no beds and he was still unable to get in.
医院过道里，人挨着人。
In the hallway of the hospital, people were close to people.
不到10分钟的时间，一位35岁的戴着氧气罩的年轻人倒地不起，就在我爸脚下。
In less than 10 minutes, a 35-year-old young man in an oxygen mask collapsed under my father's feet.
在排队的大半天时间里，他看到了3个人从靠墙坐着，变成了躺着、趴着，然后被医务人员抬走。
During most of the half-day line, he saw three men sitting against the wall, lying on their backs, sprawled, and then taken away by medical personnel.
考虑到严重交叉感染的可能性，妈妈当晚又用三轮车把爸爸带回了家里。
Considering the possibility of a serious cross-infection, Mom took Dad home that night on a tricycle.
家里面基本上给爸爸的病进行了“确诊”。
The family basically gave the father a "diagnosis" of the disease.
我们知道没有什么直接特效药能迅速治疗他的病，只希望能通过我们自己的力量撑下去。
We know that there is no quick cure for his illness, and we only hope to be able to sustain it on our own.
我爸今年57岁，在医院看到那些景象后，他说：“医院里环境太差，我自己很害怕。
"The environment in the hospital was so bad that I was scared," my father, 57, said after seeing the sights in the hospital.
”■在医院打针的人们。
"▪ People who are given injections in hospitals.
每天的打针仍然坚持进行，妈妈也试图弄两副中药缓解爸爸的情况。
The daily injection continued, and my mother tried to get two doses of traditional Chinese medicine to ease Dad's condition.
1月25日，在朋友的帮助下，我拿到了一份有助于缓解爸爸症状的中药方。
On January 25, with the help of my friends, I got a Chinese prescription that will help relieve my father's symptoms.
但是没人愿意去药房抓药，更不会有人把药送到家里来。
But no one wants to go to the drugstore for medicine, much less send it home.
最后表哥决定帮忙去抓药，他本想让快递送到家里来，却没想到连快递都无法叫出来了。
Finally my cousin decided to help catch the medicine, he wanted to send express to the home, but did not expect to be able to express out.
表哥一家五口人，因为去药房抓药的事，他和嫂子大吵了一架。
My cousin's family of five, because to go to the pharmacy for drugs, he and his sister-in-law had a big quarrel.
考虑到亲人的感受，我让表哥把药放到路边，或者车站旁的垃圾桶上，再让我妈自己去拿。
Considering the feelings of my relatives, I asked my cousin to put the medicine on the roadside, or on the garbage can next to the station, and let my mother pick it up by herself.
最后，我妈骑车到那边的小区保安值班室，才拿到了那两副药。
Finally, my mother cycled to the security guard's office over there and got the two pills.
那几天，我妈只戴着普通的医用口罩，连市面上的N95口罩都买不到。
On those days, my mother was wearing only ordinary medical masks, and couldn't even buy N95 masks on the market.
家里有人从网上看到消息，说有条件的人能买到注射的免疫球蛋白，一针将近600块钱。
Someone at home saw the news on the Internet that someone who could afford to do so could get an injection of immunoglobulin, nearly $600 a shot.
我查了一下，那个药医院没有，必须自己买。
I checked. The drug hospital didn't. I had to buy it myself.
哪怕从黑市上买到了，也需要即开即用、冷藏保存，我爸妈这种情况，根本无法操作。
Even when I bought it on the black market, it needed to be ready to use and kept in cold storage.
爸爸双肺感染严重，但一床难求1月26日，妈妈带爸爸去医院拍了片子，显示双肺感染严重。
Dad has a bad lung infection, but a bed difficult to find January 26, my mother took my father to the hospital to take a picture, showing a serious two-lung infection.
我们看到现在很多支援物资都在往武汉走，还在修建火神山、雷神山医院。
We see that now a lot of support materials are going to Wuhan, but also in the building of fire god mountain, Raytheon mountain hospital.
但那也是好几天以后的事情。
But that was a few days later.
我现在已经不做指望。
I have lost hope now.
就算修好了，这么多人能一下子住进去么？我觉得不管是否确诊，目前感染的人数，已经远远超过了预期。
If so, can so many people get in at once? I think the number of people infected, whether diagnosed or not, is far higher than expected.
即使能够住进去，也需要有人一对一照顾吧。
Even if you can live in it, you need one-on-one care.
我爸妈又没有交通工具，一个病人、一个家属，怎么住、怎么吃、配套问题怎么办？我真的很害怕，不知道下一步怎么办。
My parents have no means of transportation, a patient, a family, how to live, how to eat, how to support the problem? I am really afraid, do not know what to do next.
现在妈妈每天都在家里做饭，没时间买菜的时候就煮一些粥，强喂给爸爸吃。
Now my mother cooks at home every day. When she has no time to buy vegetables, she cooks some porridge for her father to eat.
他必须要吃东西，免疫力才不会持续掉下去。
He has to eat to keep his immunity from falling.
我意识到，我们已经在试图自救了。
I realized that we were already trying to save ourselves.
回到当阳老家之后的这个年，变得冷冷清清。
Back in his hometown of Dang Yang, the year became cold and cheerless.
所有返乡的人，都窝在家里“自我隔离”。
All who return home live in "self-segregation" at home.
空荡荡的大街像一座“鬼城”，更没人有心情去看春节联欢晚会。
Empty streets like a "ghost city", no one is in the mood to see the Spring Festival Gala.
大年三十那个晚上，家里只有爷爷奶奶和表弟一家三口。
On New Year's Eve, there were only grandparents and cousins in the family.
我们围着火炉坐着，开着电视只是为了让空荡荡的房间里稍微有点氛围。
We sat around the stove, with the TV on just to make the empty room a little more inviting.
眼睛盯着手机不断刷出新疫情，耳朵里却跑进来喜气洋洋的节目声音，心里就乱到不行。
Eyes on the mobile phone constantly brush the new epidemic, but ran in the ears of jubilant program sound, the mind is too messy.
电视里，网络上很多“武汉加油”、“湖北人民挺住”的话，可是我们挺住也是需要条件的啊，东西没有、药没有，妈妈那边口罩都买不到，床位更是别提了。
Television, on the network many "Wuhan refueling," "Hubei people hold on" words, but we also need to hold on to ah, things do not have, medicine, mother can not buy side masks, bed is not mentioned.
爷爷奶奶给爸妈打了电话，我爸没办法多说话，都是妈妈在接听。
My grandparents called my parents. My father couldn't talk much. My mother was answering the phone.
老人说了几句便开始哽咽，我们却只能在边上安慰他们。
The old man said a few words and began to choke, but we could only comfort them on the edge.
调整好爷爷奶奶的情绪，我再拨通电话，跟我妈说，你自己一定要注意，你千万不能倒下。
Adjust good grandparents mood, I dialed again, tell my mother, you must pay attention to yourself, you must not fall.
她说会注意的。
She said she would pay attention.
我妈的精神状态，至少还是积极的。
My mom's state of mind, at least, was positive.
而这个时候，我自己心里的真实感受，那种崩溃和绝望，绝不能传递给我妈，她承受的东西太多了。
And at this time, my own true feelings, the kind of collapse and despair, must not be passed on to my mother, she bears too much.
如果她也倒下了，他们俩，就没有希望了。
If she fell down too, they would have no hope.
我们家一定要挺过去有不少朋友看到我的状态，都想方设法来帮助我们家。
Our family must be able to deal with a lot of friends to see my state, all try to help our family.
很多朋友发了红包，但是即使拿着钱，我也没办法做任何事情帮助我爸妈。
Many friends sent red envelopes, but even with the money, I couldn't do anything to help my parents.
我们是在挺住，都已经在想方设法自救了，没有别的办法了。
We're holding out. We're already trying to save ourselves. There's no other way.
在老家，我自己没有遇到被人排斥的情况。
Back home, I didn't get ostracized myself.
表弟一家也顶多是被亲戚打电话告知不再拜年、串门一类的事儿。
At best, the cousins were called by relatives to tell them that they would not pay New Year visits.
但是我在网上看到很多武汉人返乡过年，被人称为“逃离武汉”，也有人在网上说我们这些在武汉工作的，这时候回到家乡都是“祸害“，尤其是湖北省外的这些说法，让人听了心里面很不是滋味。
But I saw many Wuhan people return home to celebrate the New Year, known as "escape Wuhan," some people said on the Internet that we work in Wuhan, this time back home is a "scourge," especially outside the Hubei Province, it is very unpleasant to hear.
我们是无心的。
We didn't mean it.
如果我知道情况到今天这一步，我为什么不和父母待在一起，尽我所能，让他们不用独自面对？我如今能做的，却只是把自己也隔离在老家的屋子里观察，画地为牢。
If I knew where it was today, why didn't I stay with my parents and do what I could, so that they wouldn't have to face it alone.All I could do now was to isolate myself in my own house and observe and paint.
大年初一，当阳市也全面封城了。
New Year's Day, when the city was also completely closed.
我跟父母被隔离在距离三百多公里的两个城市里。
My parents and I were isolated in two cities more than three hundred kilometers away.
我在网上看到，道路被石块泥土堵住，心里的路也一下窄了很多。
I saw on the Internet, the road was blocked by stone and dirt, the heart of the road also narrowed a lot.
我一度怀疑，这是否为“被放弃”的征兆，我也确认，这是解决问题的方式。
I wondered for a moment whether this was a sign of "abandonment," and I confirmed that this was the way to solve the problem.
2008年汶川地震的时候，我们全家都捐款相救，玉树地震的时候，我自己奔赴前线去做了志愿者。
Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, our family donated money to help, Yushu earthquake, I went to the front as a volunteer.
如果有因果，我们家这次，一定要挺过去。
If there is cause and effect, our family, this time, must survive.
