燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 闫丽娇编辑 | 周昶帆疫情之下，生鲜电商迎来了风口。
Yan Lijiao, former creator and founder of Fun Finance (ID: Rancaijing), has ushered in a new wind outlet for live electricity companies under the epidemic situation.
订单激增、拉新显著、毛利润提升，时常处于补货状态。
Order surge, pull new significantly, gross profit increased, often in the state of replenishment.
一部分长期亏损的生鲜企业，也借助此次契机，扭亏为盈。
Some long-term loss of fresh enterprises, also take advantage of this opportunity to turn a loss into a profit.
生鲜电商一直被看做是最后一个没有被线上攻破的万亿级市场。
Fresh-TV makers have long been seen as the last trillion-dollar market not to have been breached online.
生死时速之下，很多创业者都想尽可能地抓住生鲜赛道的窗口期。
Under the life and death speed, many entrepreneurs want to grasp the fresh track window as much as possible.
比如原来主打B端客户的美菜网，疫情期间也额外开通了个人用户的配送服务。
For example, the original main hit B-end customers of the American dish network, during the epidemic period also opened additional distribution services for individual users.
但众所周知，生鲜电商并不容易做。
But as we all know, fresh electricity is not easy to do.
此前曾有数据统计，国内生鲜电商领域大约有4000多家入局者，其中仅有4%营收持平，88%陷入亏损，最终只有1%实现盈利。
Statistics have shown that there are more than 4,000 entrants in the domestic live electricity business, of which only 4 per cent are flat, 88 per cent are in deficit and only 1 per cent are finally profitable.
而这短期利好并不能决定长久格局。
And this short-term good does not determine the long-term pattern.
疫情带来的短期利好将为行业带来哪些新变化？是否能重塑生鲜电商的行业格局？在线上用户被培养教育一波后，疫情结束时，每日优鲜、叮咚买菜、盒马鲜生等生鲜电商企业将如何保证留存率和复购率？“短期刺激改变不了一家企业的生死。
What new changes will the short-term benefits of the epidemic bring to the industry? Will it reshape the industry landscape of live electricity merchants? When the epidemic is over, how will the daily premium, Dong Dong and fresh boxed horses ensure the retention and repurchase rates?
对于对的商业模式是锦上添花的作用，对于错的模式只是暂时打了一针强心剂。
For the right business model is the icing on the cake, for the wrong model is only a temporary shot in the arm.
如果模型本身是错的，即便借了外力的短期影响，公司该死还是会死。
If the model itself is wrong, even with the short-term impact of outside forces, the company should die.
”不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷对燃财经表示。
Founding partner Li Zhu Jie, founder partner of Confused Venture Capital, said.
他认为，生鲜领域的创业者不能够一味强调节奏。
Entrepreneurs in the freshman world, he argues, can't just emphasize the rhythm.
在模式被验证之前，打造好单店优势、提升供应链能力，这对创业者来说才是更重要的。
Before the model is validated, it is more important for the entrepreneur to build the advantages of a single store and improve the ability of the supply chain.
2月18日，“燃财经创新经济战疫计划”推出线上沙龙第三期——《穿越疫情，生鲜电商怎样把握新机会？》，不惑创投创始合伙人李祝捷、每日优鲜合伙人兼CFO王珺围绕生鲜电商话题，在燃财经社群里进行了分享。
Feb. 18, 2008, the Fun Finance Innovative Economic Disease Program (FIELD) launched Phase III of the online salon, "Crossing the Epidemic: How to Seize New Opportunities?," which was shared with the business community around the topic of live electricity.
李祝捷提到，目前生鲜行业主要有三种模式：第一是到店模式，属于传统渠道连锁，这类企业通过长时间发展，已经做到盈亏平衡，甚至盈利，一些头部企业已经准备IPO，这类型企业在局部地区有非常高的占有率；第二是自提，这类企业没有前置仓；第三是电商送货模式。
Li noted that there are three main types of fresh industry: the first is the store-to-store mode, which belongs to the traditional channel chain. This type of enterprises has achieved profit-loss balance or even profitability through long-term development.
“无论是纯线上配送的模型还是自提柜，能不能在爆发之后保持留存和复购，以及是否能维持当下的商业模式是投资人最关注的。
"Whether it's a pure-line model or a self-propelled cabinet, whether it can be retained and repurchased after the outbreak, and whether the current business model can be maintained is the primary concern of investors.
”李祝捷强调，毕竟生鲜是日常消费，不是冲动型消费，当疫情过后销售价格会回落到正常水平，哪家公司还能维持现在的上升势头，哪家公司才会成为长远赢家。
Mr Li stressed that raw consumption was, after all, a daily consumption, not an impulsive one, and which company would be the long-term winner when sales prices fell back to normal after the epidemic and which company maintained its current upward momentum.
以下是燃财经与李祝捷的对话部分：供应链是生鲜企业要长期打造的基本功燃财经：新消费是不惑创投重点关注的赛道之一，疫情给你们投资的新消费项目带来哪些影响？你给这些项目提供了哪些建议和帮助？李祝捷：线上业态的公司是受益的。
The following is the dialogue between Caijing and Li Zhu Jie: Supply chain is a long-term basic skill of fresh enterprises to build: New consumption is one of the key routes to attract VCs attention. What is the impact of the epidemic on the new consumer items you invest in?
我们投了一家火锅食材平台，营收数据增长非常快。
We cast a hot pot food platform, the revenue data growth is very fast.
疫情期间，他们也上线了生鲜，其实生鲜并不是原来的主营业务。
During the outbreak, they also put on the line fresh, in fact, fresh is not the original main business.
但因为疫情期间，工厂、仓储之间的物流都是中断的，增加生鲜品类属于权宜之计。
But because of the outbreak, the logistics between factories, warehouses are interrupted, adding fresh raw materials is a stop-gap measure.
当时我们给被投最主要的建议是：力保物流不要成为瓶颈。
At that time, we were given the most important advice is to ensure that logistics do not become a bottleneck.
这样就能及时补货，卖更多的货，就可以赚更多的钱，从而缩短投资回收的时间。
That way, you can replenish your stock in time, sell more goods, and make more money, thus shortening the time needed for investment recovery.
这时候，提供应链的建议肯定是来不及的，因为供应链本身就是要长期打造的基本功。
At this point, supply chain advice is certainly too late, because the supply chain itself is to build a long-term basic skills.
企业必须长期关注，打造供应链的独特性。
Enterprises must focus on the long-term, to create a unique supply chain.
燃财经：如果这时候看一个生鲜电商项目，站在投资人的角度，你更关注哪些数据维度？李祝捷：第一是用户复购率；第二是区域内的渗透率。
Flaming Finance: If you are looking at a fresh electric business project at this time, what data dimensions do you care about more from the investor's point of view? Li Zhu Jie: First, the rate of user repurchase; and second, the penetration rate in the region.
因为渗透率越高，带来的履约成本越低，企业就越有可能挣到钱；第三点是我们特别看重的，一家公司是否有能力去改造供应链。
Because the higher the penetration rate, the lower the cost of performance, the more likely it is that the firm will earn money; and the third factor that we particularly value is whether a company has the capacity to transform the supply chain.
如果他能改造供应链，它的核心竞争力肯定是超过其他企业的。
If he can revamp the supply chain, its core competitiveness will surely surpass that of other firms.
燃财经：经此一“疫”，你在生鲜电商的仓储、物流和配送模式上，得到了什么启发？李祝捷：我观察到的各种模式，很多都是需要线上线下一起做的。
Flaming Finance: What did you learn from the epidemic in terms of storage, logistics and distribution patterns of fresh electric startups? Li Zhu Jie: Many of the models I observe need to be done online and offline together.
所以我得出的结论是，无论自提还是到店模式或是在线订货、线下送货模式，企业应该打组合拳。
So I came to the conclusion that companies should fight a combination of self-promotion, store-to-store or online ordering and off-line delivery.
任何单一模式，都有一定的局限性。
Any single model has certain limitations.
最重要的是，提高渗透率，否则履约成本降不下来，永远不会盈利。
The most important thing is to increase the penetration rate, otherwise the cost of compliance will not fall and will never be profitable.
燃财经：有人认为生鲜电商卖得越多、亏得越多，站在投资人角度，你觉得这种说法符合事实吗？李祝捷：消费互联网的生意本质是需要引流，生鲜更像一个引流品。
Some people believe that the more you sell and the more you lose, the more you think this is true from the point of view of investors.Li Zhu-jie: The nature of the business of consuming the Internet is that it needs to be drained and raw is more like a drain.
它频次高，需求足够刚性，虽然客单价足够低，但有的生鲜企业的毛利也很高，总之具有两面性。
It is high frequency, demand is rigid enough, although the unit price of customers is low enough, but some fresh enterprises also have a high gross profit, in short, two-sided.
所以这个品类亏，如果别的品类拉平利润，这个公司的商业模式还是有可能持平的。
So this category deficit, if other categories draw even profits, the company's business model is likely to be flat.
永辉超市本质就是生鲜引流，然后通过二房东模式挣钱，这就是一个非常好的商业模式，永辉也是千亿人民币市值的公司。
Yonghui supermarket is the essence of fresh drainage, and then through the model of the two landlords to make money, this is a very good business model, Yonghui is also 100 billion yuan market value of the company.
所以其实根本问题不在于生鲜亏得怎么样，而是整个公司的商业模式如何设计和打磨。
So the fundamental question is not how well the company loses, but how the company's business model is designed and polished.
燃财经：去年以来，生鲜电商的盈利模式遭受的质疑一直比较多，你认为如今这个问题彻底解决了吗？下一步还要做什么，这个行业才能彻底崛起？李祝捷：现在还不能太早下定论。
Flaming Finance: Since last year, there have been a lot of questions about the profit model of fresh electricity companies. Do you think this issue has been completely solved? What is the next step for the industry to emerge completely? Li Zhu Jie: It is too early to say.
假设线下很多业态逐渐被移除，城市当中只剩下电商企业。
Assuming that much of the offline business is being phased out, only electrical businesses are left in the city.
他们通过提价，或是找到了像永辉超市这样的二房东模式，也是可以盈利的。
They can also make a profit by raising prices or by finding a model like Wing Fai Supermarket, a landlords' model.
但结果还要观察，疫情期间，C端需求井喷，属于短期红利。
But it also turns out that the C-side demand blowout during the epidemic is a short-term dividend.
等到疫情消退之后，价格回归到敏感区间，消费者到底有没有留存？有多少留存？以及商业模式有没有补充？这时候才能做一些判断。
When the epidemic subsides and prices return to sensitive territory, are consumers still alive? How much is left? And is the business model replenished? Only then can some judgment be made.
燃财经：当前阶段，生鲜电商平台之间竞争的焦点是什么？你最看好哪些平台？你认为新加入战局的创业企业还有没有机会？李祝捷：目前生鲜平台之间竞争的焦点是跑马圈地，大家都在抢获客和新增。
Flaming Finance: What is the focus of competition among the new TV business platforms at this stage? What are your favorite platforms? Do you think there is still a chance for startups to join the war?
但是任何电商平台，最终的竞争本质都是留存和复购，否则抢再多地盘其实也没用。
But any electric business platform, the ultimate competitive nature of the retention and re-purchase, otherwise no matter how much turf is useless.
我们相对比较看好区域为王以及供应链为王的企业。
We are relatively bullish on the region for Wang and the supply chain for Wang's enterprises.
区域为王能做到非常高的渗透率，才能降低履约成本。
Regions can achieve very high penetration rates in order to reduce the cost of compliance.
有独特的供应链，才能提供给客户超越预期的产品。
There is a unique supply chain to provide customers with products beyond expectations.
疫情只会起加速作用大趋势不会改变燃财经：有人说生鲜电商眼下的爆发会是昙花一现，你赞成吗？疫情结束后，你认为哪些东西是能留下来、让这些企业继续受益的？李祝捷：我不太同意昙花一现的说法。
Do you agree with those who say that the current explosion of live TV companies will be flash in the pan What do you think will stay and continue to benefit these enterprises after the outbreak? Li Zhu Jie: I don't agree that this is a flash in the pan.
本质上，生鲜品类的线上化是一个必然的长期趋势，只是说什么时间能把它变为现实。
In essence, the online nature of fresh produce is an inevitable long-term trend, only to say when it will become a reality.
最核心的还是疫情过后，企业真正的留存数据。
At the heart of the epidemic is the real data retained by companies after the epidemic.
生鲜电商眼下的爆发是井喷式的，但长期让所有人都关在家里做饭，是不可能持续的。
The current outburst is well-sprung, but keeping everyone at home to cook for a long time is not sustainable.
疫情之后，需求肯定会下降。
After the epidemic, demand is bound to decline.
但是在家吃饭依然是一个非常大的场景，我们其实一直在找在家吃饭这个场景里的创新公司，这是一个更大的赛道。
But eating at home is still a big scene, and we've actually been looking for innovative companies to eat at home, a bigger circuit.
燃财经：作为投资人，2020年你面临着哪些难题？怎么应对？李祝捷：作为投资机构，面临的问题永远是那四个字的难题—募投管退。
Flaming Finance: What challenges do you face as an investor in 2020? How to deal with it? Li Chunjie: As an investment agency, the problem is always one of those four words - private placement.
2019年募资就比较困难了，2020年在疫情影响下，包括政府引导资金都会开始收紧。
It will be harder to raise funds in 2019, which will begin to tighten in the wake of the epidemic, including government-directed funding.
对于GP来说会更加困难。
It's going to be harder for the GP.
投资其实是个好时间，但前提是你得有充足的账面资金。
Investing is a good time, but only if you have sufficient funds on paper.
你可以用比较低的价格去买一些比较有潜质、短期受影响的公司。
You can use lower prices to buy a more potential, short-term impact of the company.
从投资机构管理者的角度说，也是有挑战的。
From the perspective of the managers of investment institutions, there are also challenges.
你如果投了很多的早期公司，在后续的融资不能指望、没有产生现金流情况之下，这个公司怎么活下来，这是需要投资人和创业者一起思考应对的。
If you put in a lot of early companies, it takes investors and entrepreneurs to figure out how the company will survive without the expectation and cash flow of subsequent funding.
退也困难，这几个环节都是相关联的。
It is also difficult to retreat, and these links are all interrelated.
第一条策略就是狠抓企业现金流，做最坏的打算，最积极的努力。
The first strategy is to seize the cash flow of the enterprise, do the worst, the most active efforts.
与此同时，集中精力关注头部项目的资本化，争取早日推动他们IPO。
At the same time, focus on capitalizing on head items and trying to promote their IPOs as soon as possible.
燃财经：所有人都在讨论现金流，在你看来生鲜电商平台的现金流有何特点？创业者应该怎么维持健康的现金流？李祝捷：现金流对每个企业都非常重要。
Caijing: Everyone is talking about cash flow, what do you think are the cash flow characteristics of the fresh electric business platform? How should entrepreneurs maintain healthy cash flow? Li Zhu Jie: Cash flow is very important to every company.
生鲜电商的现金流其实取决于和供应商之间的关系，也就是账期。
Fresh electricity business cash flow depends on the relationship with the supplier, that is, account period.
账期越长，现金流就越好。
The longer the period, the better the cash flow.
尤其是在需求井喷的情况之下。
Especially when demand is booming.
无论哪个行业，都可以把这一点拿出来判断一个企业的行业地位。
No matter which industry, can take this point out to judge an enterprise's industry position.
行业地位越高，它能拿到的账期就会越长。
The higher its position in the industry, the longer it will be able to earn its bills.
怎么才能拿到更长的账期呢？本质是C端的销售能力提升。
How to get a longer period of account? Essentially, the sales capacity of the C end is improved.
当销售的规模效应非常明显的时候，企业跟供应链的谈判能力就会大幅提升，现金流就自然好。
When the scale effect of sales is obvious, the ability to negotiate with the supply chain will greatly improve, the cash flow is naturally good.
燃财经：疫情对生鲜电商行业有何重构作用？小型电商企业是否迎来了发展空间？李祝捷：重构是一定的，因为需求端的井喷，导致了消费习惯进行了一次比砸钱更猛烈的习惯养成，这本身就是重构。
Flaming Finance: What is the effect of epidemic situation on the fresh electric commerce industry? Is there room for the development of small enterprises? Li Zhu Jie: The refactoring is certain because the blowout on the demand side has led to a more violent habit of consuming habits than throwing money, which is in itself a reconstruction.
小型生鲜电商这个赛道不一定非像阿里、京东那样做成一个全国性的公司。
Small fresh electric business this circuit does not have to be like Ali, Jingdong as a national company.
也许区域性密度非常高的生鲜企业也足以IPO。
Perhaps the regional density of very high fresh enterprises is also sufficient IPO.
我们投的锅圈，就是在在家吃饭这个大场景里面做的创新。
We cast the pot ring, is at home to eat this big scene inside the innovation.
它本身是一个垂直行业的Costco模型。
It is itself a vertical industry model of Costco.
能够让大家用更便宜的价格吃到更好的食材。
Can let everybody eat the better food material with cheaper price.
这类公司，因为贴近社区便利，吃饭又是刚需，所以它发展的比较好。
This kind of company, because is close to the community convenient, the meal is just needed, so it develops relatively well.
燃财经：投资的寒冬今年会过去吗？以及2020你觉得哪些方面会是投资最好的方向？李祝捷：投资寒冬从目前看应该是更寒冷了。
Flaming Finance: Will the winter of investment pass this year? And what do you think will be the best direction to invest in 2020? Li Chunjie: Investing in the winter should be colder now.
今年上半年投资机构基本都在管自己的被投，基本都在干投后的事情。
In the first half of this year, investment institutions are basically in charge of their own investment, basically in the post-investment thing.
对于新项目，也没办法出差和尽调，所以面临重重的投资困难。
For new projects, there is no way to travel and out of tune, so face heavy investment difficulties.
我个人判断，疫情之后有一波明显增长的企业会脱颖而出，而大基金会重点投资这些公司，他们也会加剧马太效应。
Personally, I think there will be a distinct wave of growth in the aftermath of the epidemic, and major foundations will focus on investing in these companies, and they will exacerbate the Matthew effect.
而对于普通创业者来说，资本寒冬，我觉得大概率还会延续。
And for ordinary entrepreneurs, capital winter, I think the probability will continue.
但是从另外一个角度，国家肯定会出台大量政策鼓励投资，也会为中小创业企业减负。
But on the other hand, the state is sure to have plenty of policies to encourage investment and reduce the burden on small and medium-sized startups.
政策主导的利好，使得资金面是不是也会有转机，我们也拭目以待。
Policy-led positive, so that the fund surface will also have a turning point, we also wait and see.
疫情对投资方向没有产生太大影响。
The epidemic has had little impact on the direction of investment.
目前大家普遍比较看好的在线业态，包括在线办公等企业服务项目多数已经产业互联网化，没有受到特别大的影响。
At present, most of the popular online service projects, including on-line office, have been Internet-based industry, not particularly affected.
疫情就是一个加速作用，并不会改变真正的大趋势。
The epidemic is an acceleration that will not change the real megatrends.
所以投资机构之前关注什么方向，我认为大概率还是会持续关注。
So what direction did the investor focus on before, I think the high probability will continue to pay attention.
