The government believes the rate of increase in the number of people diagnosed with the new crown virus in Daegu city and Gyeongshan North Province has stabilized and no signs of a rapid spread of the epidemic nationwide have been observed, the government said at a news conference on Tuesday.

But Park Ling-hou also pointed out that because of the emergence of confirmed patients throughout the country, to continue to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control, can not take lightly.
在截至当天零时确诊的7134例病例中，有79.4%与集体感染有关，62.8%与新天地教会相关。
Of the 7,134 cases diagnosed as of 00pm on the same day, 79.4 per cent were related to group infections and 62.8 per cent to the Church of Xintiandi.
目前，大邱市政府对新天地信徒的病毒检测工作已基本完成，正集中对普通市民进行检测。
At present, Daegu city government has basically completed the virus detection for believers in Xintiandi, is focusing on the general public testing.
大邱确诊病例数 来源：韩国中央防疫对策本部韩国《东亚日报》9日也指出，曾是新冠肺炎疫情最大火焰的大邱庆北地区“新天地”集体感染事态接近了尾声，但以疗养院和公寓等为中心，零星的集体感染火势依然没有减弱，因此掉以轻心还为时尚早。
South Korea's Central Anti-epidemic Policy Headquarters South Korea's East Asia Daily reported Wednesday that the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia outbreak in Daegu Qingbei District is coming to an end. However, it is still too early to focus on sanatoriums and apartments.
比如上周末，政府就因为一栋公寓楼有46人确诊而首次采取了封楼措施。
Last weekend, for example, the government first closed a building because 46 people were diagnosed in an apartment building.
据了解，该公寓的142名住户中，有94人是新天地信徒。
It is understood that of the 142 occupants of the apartment, 94 are adherents of Xintiandi.
庆北奉化郡的蓝色疗养院则有51人确诊，包括40名入住者，高龄患者集体感染事件引发担忧。
Fifty-one people, including 40 residents, were diagnosed at the Blue Sanatorium in Fenghua County, Gyeongbei.
此外，大邱和釜山还出现了孕妇感染病例，截至目前已有8名孕妇确诊感染。
In addition, there have been cases of infection among pregnant women in Daegu and Busan, and eight pregnant women have been diagnosed so far.
尽管防疫部门表示，胎儿几乎不可能垂直感染，但免疫力低下的孕妇和出生未满3个月的婴儿一旦感染，就很有可能是重症病例。
Although vaccination authorities say it is almost impossible for a fetus to become vertically infected, low-immunity pregnant women and infants under three months of age are more likely to be seriously ill once infected.
目前，韩国的药企正在争分夺秒与病毒“赛跑”。
South Korea's drug companies are racing against the virus for seconds.
韩国制药生物协会9日表示，国内有15家生物制药企业已开始或正准备研制新冠病毒疫苗和药物制剂。
The Korea Pharmaceutical Biology Association said on the 9th, 15 domestic biopharmaceutical enterprises have begun or are preparing to develop a new crown virus vaccine and pharmaceutical preparations.
其中，韩国GC绿十字和SK生物科技等5家药企宣布开始研发疫苗，赛尔群等10家药企也已着手或准备研发相关药物，手段包括分析治愈者血液、研究抗流感药物效果等。
Five pharmaceutical companies, including GC Green Cross of South Korea and SK Biotechnology, announced plans to develop vaccines, and 10 pharmaceutical companies, including Selkner, have started or are preparing to develop drugs, including by analyzing the blood of cured people and studying the effects of anti-flu drugs.
国立保健研究院、科学技术信息通信部、韩国化学研究院、韩国生命工学研究院4家机构也为研发新冠疫苗和药物正在积极推进政府和民间合作。
The National Institute of Health Care, the Ministry of Science and Technology Information and Communication, the Korean Chemical Research Institute, and the Korea Institute of Bioengineering are also actively promoting government-private partnerships for the development of new crown vaccines and drugs.
不过，预计完成研发和临床试验至少还需要数月甚至数年。
However, it is expected to take months or even years to complete research and development and clinical trials.
韩国制药生物协会会长元喜睦表示，将基于政府支持的生物药企研发力量克服危机。
Yuanxihi, president of the Korean Pharmaceutical Biology Association, said it would overcome the crisis on the basis of government-backed research and development.
但也有专家认为，由于大多数药企仍处于研发初期阶段且未进入临床试验，预计最早也要到年底才能实现临床应用，因而不宜对此盲目期待。
However, some experts believe that since most pharmaceutical companies are still in the early stages of research and development and do not enter clinical trials, clinical applications are not expected until the end of the year at the earliest, so it is not appropriate to expect blindly.
据韩国外交部9日消息，截至当天上午9时，对韩国采取入境管制措施的国家和地区已增至106个。
As of 9: 00 a.m. on the same day, the number of countries and territories taking immigration control measures against South Korea had increased to 106, the Foreign Ministry said.
从9日零时起，韩日两国也暂停了对方公民的免签证入境政策，韩联社预计贸易和人员往来等双边交流或将遭受重创，使双边关系进一步恶化。
South Korea and Japan also suspended visa-free access for each other's citizens from 0 p.m. on the 9th, and the agency said it expected bilateral exchanges such as trade and people-to-people exchanges to suffer further deterioration.
