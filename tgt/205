Li Lanjuan, a member of the National Fitness and Health Commission's high-level panel of experts, said in an interview with CCTV on February 3 that Wuhan does not have enough reagents (boxes) to send more accurate reagents (boxes) to Wuhan to get more people tested.
试剂盒主要用于PCR核酸检测，是被各地医院重点使用的新型冠状病毒检测方法，成本相对低廉，每人份检测约需180元。
The kit is mainly used for PCR nucleic acid detection. It is a new coronavirus detection method used by hospitals all over the world.
国家卫健委同样推荐使用基因测序方法：确认与新型冠状病毒高度同源者，可确诊为新型肺炎。
The National Fitness and Health Commission also recommended using gene sequencing: confirmed with the new coronavirus high homologous, can be diagnosed as a new pneumonia.
每例检测约需1万元。
Each test will cost about $10,000.
悬殊的成本对比之下，核酸试剂盒成为疫区医疗机构确诊病例的“必要武器”。
In contrast to the huge cost, nucleic acid test kits have become a "necessary weapon" for confirmed cases in medical institutions in affected areas.
新型冠状病毒是新出现的疾病，此前并无专门检测试剂，得知疫情后，众多企业短时间内完成研发，药监部门开放快速通道进行审批，保障试剂盒供应。
The new coronavirus is a new coronavirus. There was no special reagent to detect the coronavirus. Many enterprises completed their research and development in a short time after learning of the outbreak.
随之而来的，是核酸试剂盒产量能否跟上、准确度能否保证、物流是否通畅，以及检测机构能力能否匹配等一系列问题。
This is followed by a series of questions such as whether nucleic acid test kits can keep pace, whether accuracy can be ensured, whether logistics are free, and whether the testing institutions' capabilities can match.
就此，我们请教大量专业人士，试图解答试剂盒从研发生产到实验室使用，这一过程中面临的各种问题以及解决方案。
In this regard, we consulted a large number of professionals, trying to answer the test kit from R & D production to laboratory use, the problems faced in the process and solutions.
审批：时限两年变四天1月26日开始，已经有7个新型冠状病毒核酸检测试剂盒产品陆续通过国家药监局审批，获得上市批件。
Approval: From two to four days January 26, seven new coronavirus nucleic acid test kit products have been approved by the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration to obtain market approval.
这些产品分别来自捷诺生物、之江生物、达安基因、圣湘生物、华大基因、伯杰医疗等。
These products come from Jeno organism, Jiang Zhibiao, Da'an gene, Shenxiang biology, Huada gene, Berger medicine, etc.
这意味着，更多检测产品可以合规进入各地医院，大大拓展了检测试剂的使用范围。
This means that more testing products can be entered in compliance with local hospitals, greatly expanding the use of detection reagents.
此前，这些检测产品即便生产出来，若未获得上市批件，只能以“科研目的”供疾控系统使用。
Previously, these detection products even if produced, if not listed approval, can only be used "for scientific purposes" supply disease control system.
《长江日报》称，此前武汉已经将试剂盒发放给10家机构，开展病原核酸检测，除武汉市疾控中心外，剩余9家均是医院。
The Changjiang Daily said Wuhan had already distributed test kits to 10 agencies to carry out pathogen nucleic acid testing, in addition to Wuhan City CDC, the remaining nine are hospitals.
自1月28日起，当地又增加了8家机构检测机构，其中5家是区县级疾控中心。
Since 28 January, eight more local testing facilities have been added, five of which are district-level CDC centres.
知情人士表示，国家药监局于1月22日召集17家企业开展评审，其中7家企业研发的新型冠状病毒核酸检测试剂，获选进入国家药监局的快速审批通道。
On January 22, 17 companies were convoked by the State Administration of Pharmacy to conduct a review, according to people familiar with the matter. Seven of them were selected to enter the fast-track approval channel of the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration.
当日，国家药监局表态称，将做好应急审评审批准备，根据法律法规要求和工作需求，“随时启动疫情防控所需药品、医疗器械的应急审批。
On the same day, the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision said that it would do a good job of emergency review and approval, according to the requirements of laws and regulations and work requirements, "at any time to start the prevention and control of the necessary drugs and medical equipment emergency approval.
”随后，在监管的配合下，入选企业“一路狂奔”。
Subsequently, with regulatory co-ordination, the selected companies "ran all the way."
1月26日，国家药监局发布公告，称“应急审批通过4家企业4个新型冠状病毒检测产品”，前后走完审批流程仅耗时四天。
On January 26, the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration issued a notice, saying that "emergency examination and approval has been granted to four enterprises for four new coronavirus testing products," taking only four days to complete the approval process.
随后几天，其他入选企业的产品相继获批。
In the following days, the products of other selected enterprises were approved successively.
新型冠状病毒的检测试剂盒属于三类医疗器械。
The new coronavirus detection kit belongs to three types of medical devices.
按通常流程，在通过注册检验后，地方药监局将完成针对样品生产过程的体系考核，并将体系考核报告提交国家药监局以供审批。
According to the usual procedure, after passing the registration inspection, the local pharmaceutical supervisory bureau will complete the systematic examination of the sample production process and submit the system evaluation report to the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision for examination and approval.
若审批通过，申报器械获得上市批件。
If the approval is approved, the declared instrument shall be issued with the market approval.
一家上海试剂企业的负责人表示，近期检验机构的效率非常高：大年初一将资料提交给北京医疗器械检验所后，该所连夜加班，在年初二上午结束所有批次试验后，反馈了合格报告，方便企业开展后续审批流程。
The director of a Shanghai reagent company said the recent inspection agency was very efficient: after submitting the data to the Beijing Medical Device Inspection Bureau on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the institute worked overtime overnight.
事实上，快速通道审批大大节约了这些新研发医疗器械上市的时间。
In fact, fast-track approvals have saved these new medical devices a lot of time to go on the market.
行业人士透露，通常这种三类医疗器械的上市审批时间约为两年，其中有一年的临床试验数据收集期；体外诊断试剂至少须提供1000例样本量。
Typically, these three types of devices take about two years to market, including one year of clinical trial data collection, and in vitro diagnostic reagents must provide at least 1,000 samples, industry sources said.
上述试剂企业负责人还介绍道，医疗器械研发成功后，须先做临床数据收集，待验证数据可靠性和有效性之后，再获批上市许可。
The head of the reagent enterprise also said that after the successful development of medical equipment, we must first do clinical data collection, until the reliability and validity of the data have been verified before being approved for market approval.
但为控制目前的疫情，这一快速通道压缩了疾控系统做临床数据收集的时间。
But to control the current outbreak, this fast-track compression disease control system to do clinical data collection time.
此前，新型冠状病毒肺炎的确认需要疾控部门来检测或复核，因此使用这些未取得上市批件检测盒也不算违规——疾控部门的操作被视为临床试验的一部分。
Previously, the confirmation of the new coronavirus pneumonia needed to be tested or reviewed by the CDC, so it was not illegal to use these unapproved test kits - CDC operations were considered part of clinical trials.
质量：理性看待准确度此前，有科研人员表示，试剂盒通常存在假阳性和假阴性的问题，若无法控制次品率，可能造成检测结果出错。
Quality: Reasonably Looking at Accuracy Some researchers have said that test kits often have false positives and false negatives, and that failure to control defective rates could lead to errors in test results.
假阳性指的是误诊，而假阴性指的是漏诊。
False positive refers to misdiagnosis, while false negative refers to missing diagnosis.
此外，由于疾控系统使用的体外试剂不需要获得国家药监局的审批，其他在药监局快速审批通道之外的企业，正在通过疾控系统“跑步”进入这一市场。
In addition, since external reagents used in the disease control system do not require approval from the State Administration of Pharmacy, other companies outside the FDA's fast-track approval channel are "running" into the market through the disease control system.
例如，西陇科学、科华生物、硕世生物、美康生物、迈克生物等上市公司此前均表示，研发成功了针对新型冠状病毒的核酸检测试剂盒，其中部分公司表态向多个省级疾控中心供应。
For example, listed companies such as Xilong Science, Kohwa Biology, Mecang Biology, Michaebiology and other listed companies have all previously indicated that they have successfully developed nucleic acid test kits for the new coronavirus, with some of these companies offering supplies to provincial CDC.
随着试剂盒使用数量的增加，潜在的检测不准确问题引发关注。
As the number of test kits used increases, the potential for inaccurate detection is a cause for concern.
被广为引述的案例来自天津。
The widely cited case comes from Tianjin.
天津一女性感染病例，1月21日出现发热后，于27日、31日共做三次核酸检测，均呈阴性，2月1日第四次检测后才呈阳性。
A woman in Tianjin tested negative for nucleic acid three times on January 27 and 31 after developing fever on January 21 and tested positive for the fourth time on February 1.
武汉大学附属中南医院影像科副主任张笑春在社交媒体上发出呼吁，“别迷信核酸检测”，理由是已经出现“隐匿疾病”的患者，“一次或者多次核酸阴性，无任何临床症状。
Zhang Xiaochun, deputy director of imaging at Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital, called on social media to "do not superstitious nucleic acid testing" on the grounds that patients who have "hidden disease" have "negative nucleic acid once or more without any clinical symptoms.
”技术人员解释道，目前获批的试剂盒产品多使用PCR核酸检测，基本原理是利用技术扩大检测样本上的病毒序列，使之得到凸显，以确认患病。
Technicians explain that PCR nucleic acid testing is used in most of the currently approved kit products, and that the basic principle is to use technology to amplify and highlight the virus sequences on test samples to identify the disease.
如果病人刚患病，样本中病毒载量过低，可能出现假阴性（漏诊）的情况。
If the patient is newly ill, the viral load in the sample is too low and a false negative (missed diagnosis) may occur.
由于PCR检测方法非常敏感，“有一点污染就会造成误测”，技术人员在分析天津假阴性案例时表示，操作不慎可能使得试剂盒检测结果不准确。
Because of the sensitivity of the PCR test method, "a bit of contamination can cause errors," technicians analyzed false-negative cases in Tianjin and said careless handling could make the results of the kit inaccurate.
检测技术公司“泰格捷通”总经理彭沂非呼吁公众理性看待试剂盒质量。
Peng Yifei, general manager of Tageton, a testing technology company, calls for a rational view of kit quality.
他对我们表示，为应对急速进展的疫情，刚刚获批的试剂盒在实验室做验证的时间相当短，“但面对紧急公共卫生事件，首先要有检测工具。
He told us that, in response to the rapid advance of the epidemic, the newly approved kits had a relatively short time to be tested in the laboratory, "but in the face of public health emergencies, the first thing to do is to have detection tools."
”“一点工具都没有，会大大影响疫情的控制和处理，包括政府决策。
"There is no tool at all that could significantly affect the control and handling of the epidemic, including government decision-making.
质量高低是次一级要解决的问题。
Quality is a secondary issue to be addressed.
”彭沂非说。
'said Peng Yifei.
针对假阳性和假阴性问题，“要看比例，而不是只看个例。
For false positives and false negatives, look at the scale, not just the examples.
”彭沂非表示，“其他疾病试剂盒出现假阳性和假阴性问题也很常见，例如1万例检测中有5个、10个的，你不能说它有问题，如果检测1000例，500例都没测准，那肯定不行。
"False-positive and false-negative problems are also common in other disease test kits, such as 5 and 10 out of 10,000 tests, and you can't say it's problematic," says Peng Yifei.
”产能：已经恢复六七成工信部党组成员、总工程师田玉龙2月3日在国新办发布会上表示，在克服了时间和复产上“小困难”后，各家企业的日均试剂盒产能合计达到77.3万人份。
"Production capacity: Six or seven percent of the Ministry of Industry and Communications, Chief Engineer Tian Yulong, said at a press conference on Feb. 3 that after overcoming" minor difficulties "in time and production, the companies' daily average production capacity reached 773,000.
田玉龙补充说，目前产能还没完全恢复，只达到最大产能的“百分之六七十。
Mr Tian added that capacity had not yet fully recovered, reaching only "670 per cent" of its maximum capacity.
”此前，各家企业相继公布了自家的产能数据：华大基因表示，该公司常规产能为每日2万人份，若有需要可扩充至5万人份。
Earlier, companies reported their own production figures: Huada says its regular capacity is 20,000 people a day, which could be expanded to 50,000 if needed.
华大基因还新储备了30万人份的原料。
Huada also has a new stockpile of 300,000 people of raw materials.
辉睿生物总经理李辉2月2日介绍，除库存10万份现货外，目前每日产能达到10万人份。
Pfizer general manager Li Hui said February 2, in addition to the inventory of 100,000 spot, the current daily capacity of 100,000 people.
为保证后续生产，辉睿还有200万人份的原料备货。
In order to ensure follow-up production, Pfizer still has 2 million raw materials in stock.
圣湘生物副总经理周俊告诉我们，该公司日常产量约为10万人份,若有需要可进一步拓展至每日50万人份。
The company has a daily production capacity of about 100,000 people, which can be further expanded to 500,000 people per day if necessary, said Zhou Jun, deputy general manager of Sunshine Biology.
央视援引之江生物的消息说，该公司每日产量“能达到20万人份”，200名工作人员加班加点，“除夕夜都没有休息，灯火通明”。
The company's daily output "could reach 200,000 people," and 200 workers were working overtime to "have no rest and bright lights on New Year's Eve," CCTV quoted Jiang as saying.
还有要求匿名的试剂盒研发企业表示，“全公司三班倒，每天10万人份的产量已经是极限。
"Three shifts a day is the limit," says the company, which requires anonymity in its kit development.
”这家企业通过了国家药监局的快速审批。
The company passed the State Administration of Pharmacy's fast-track approval.
不仅如此，多数企业还向重点疫区捐赠了不少试剂。
Not only that, most enterprises also donated many reagents to key epidemic areas.
例如，华大基因表示，到1月30日捐赠了2万人份诊断试剂，待捐赠10万人员份。
For example, Huada Gene says it donated 20,000 diagnostic reagents by January 30, leaving 100,000 people to donate.
圣湘表示通过中国红十字会向武汉捐赠了价值1000万元的试剂和器械。
Sunshine said it donated 10 million yuan worth of reagents and equipment to Wuhan through the Chinese Red Cross.
辉睿生物与百瑞生物联合捐赠了100万元的检测试剂盒。
Rui Biology and Berry Biology jointly donated a $1 million test kit.
尽管各试剂厂家铆足了劲，力图在短期内大幅提升针对新型冠状病毒的检测试纸和试剂，但前方医院依旧反馈试剂不够用。
Although the reagent manufacturers have made great efforts to improve the detection paper and reagent for the new coronavirus in a short period of time, the forward hospital is still short of reagents.
这与工信部总工程师田玉龙的表态有所出入：试剂盒日产量“相当于疑似患者的40倍，从总的供应来看，基本满足要求。
That is a departure from what Tian Yulong, chief engineer at the Ministry of Industry and Communications, said: "The daily production of the kit is 40 times that of the suspected patient and generally meets the requirements in terms of overall supply."
”一家试剂厂商从当地疾控处获得的信息同样是“试剂盒多得用不完”。
One reagent manufacturer obtained the same information from the local CDC that "there is an inexhaustible supply of test kits."
一位疾控专业人士表示，这或许反映出来湖北当地对试剂盒调配有待优化：应该把总体够用的试剂盒合理分配到各个急需它的区域或机构。
One disease-control professional says this may reflect the fact that the local dispensing of test kits in Hubei province needs to be optimized: those that are generally adequate should be rationally distributed to regions or agencies that need them.
试图提升试剂产能的厂家还面临一些让人哭笑不得的问题。
Companies trying to boost reagent capacity also face some sobbing problems.
例如，有试剂生产商透露，周边公司对于试剂产品本身缺乏了解，认为试剂厂商是在“生产病毒”，以停水停电为要挟，要求其停止生产。
For example, reagent manufacturers have revealed that there is a lack of understanding of the reagent products themselves, believing that the reagent manufacturers are "producing viruses" and demanding that they stop production as a result of blackouts.
物流：运入武汉不成问题试剂盒能否快速抵达一线医务人员的手中，除与产能相关，也与物流状况密切相关。
Logistics: into Wuhan is no problem whether the kit can quickly reach the hands of front-line medical personnel, in addition to capacity-related, and logistics closely linked.
除华大基因在武汉当地生产外，获批企业多数不在湖北当地，而是分布在上海、广东和湖南等多地，须得通过物流运输至武汉。
Apart from the local production of Huada Gene in Wuhan, most of the enterprises approved are not located in Hubei, but in many places such as Shanghai, Guangdong and Hunan, and must be transported to Wuhan through logistics.
华大基因回应，由于试剂盒在武汉本地生产，物流方面没有困难。
Huada gene response, because the kit in Wuhan local production, logistics do not have difficulties.
尽管原材料在各地采购，但物流“绿色通道”给其提供了便利。
Although raw materials are purchased everywhere, the "green channel" of logistics facilitates it.
多数企业并没有这么幸运。
Most businesses are not so lucky.
例如，辉睿生物的工作人员26日还在社交媒体上寻找物流，希望能够将试剂盒运至武汉。
For example, Pfizer staff on the 26th also look for logistics on social media, hoping to be able to transport kits to Wuhan.
圣湘生物副总经理周俊表示，中国红十字帮该公司协调了部分通行证，以方便将检测试剂运至武汉。
Zhou Jun, deputy general manager, said the Chinese Red Cross helped coordinate part of the pass to facilitate the transport of the reagents to Wuhan.
有试剂厂商的工作人员表示，在找到物流商帮忙之前，甚至“有同事拼命把试剂人肉运到一线”。
Staff at reagent makers say they may even "struggle to get reagent human flesh to the front line" before turning to a logistics company for help.
另外，部分产品对物流储存条件提出更高要求，提升了运输难度。
In addition, some products put forward higher requirements for logistics storage conditions, raising the difficulty of transportation.
例如，之江生物生产的试剂盒就要求零下20度的储存环境，这使得仅少数有冷链能力的物流企业可以承运。
For example, the kits produced by Zhijiang require a storage environment of 20 degrees below zero, which allows only a few logistics companies with cold-chain capabilities to carry it.
好在，目前物流情况有所好转，包括各大快递企业、公路物流运输企业，只要在武汉当地有对接机构，无论航空或是陆运，货品多可顺利进入武汉。
Fortunately, the current logistics situation has improved, including major express enterprises, road logistics transport enterprises, as long as there are docking facilities in Wuhan, whether by air or land, goods can enter Wuhan smoothly.
交通运输部副部长2月3日在国新办发布会上表示，该部“着力构建部省联动的运输保障工作机制，协调解决应急运输的问题，特别是妥善解决湖北省所需要的疫情防控物资和畜禽等生活物资的运输保障”。
The Ministry of Transport said at a press conference on Feb. 3 that the ministry was "focusing on the construction of a transport guarantee mechanism linking the ministries and provinces, and coordinating the solution of emergency transportation problems, especially the proper settlement of the epidemic situation in Hubei Province and the transportation guarantee of livestock and poultry."
检测：专业实验室待扩容此前，华大基因创始人汪建公开呼吁，“在注重临床抢救的同时，把精准检测和诊断视为同等重要。
Testing: Before the expansion of the professional laboratory, Huada gene founder Wang Jian public appeal, "while focusing on clinical rescue, accurate detection and diagnosis as equally important.
”他的理由是，及时精准的检测将帮助“快速给出临床诊断……解除恐慌和不必要的隔离”。
His argument is that timely and accurate testing would help "to give a rapid clinical diagnosis... to relieve panic and unnecessary isolation."
汪建表示，检测能力提升后，包括疑似和发热待查病人、一线高危工作者，以及希望了解感染风险的大众，都可以逐步获得明确的筛查结果。
Wang said improved testing capabilities, including suspected and febrile patients, first-line high-risk workers and the general public wishing to understand the risk of infection, would gradually lead to clear screening results.
这就需要武汉乃至湖北各实验室提升检测能力。
This requires Wuhan and even Hubei laboratories to improve the detection capacity.
泰格捷通总经理彭沂非对此表示，PCR检测方法非常灵敏，需要“把很小的信号放大几百万倍”，因此“有一点污染就会造成误测，所以检测实验室的条件和仪器很重要。
Peng Yifei, general manager of Tageton, said the PCR method was sensitive and needed to "amplify small signals millions of times," so "a little pollution can cause errors, so it is important to test laboratory conditions and instruments.
”此外，检测人员的专业素养同样关键。
Moreover, the professionalism of the testers is also crucial.
检测试剂盒无法单独使用，需要有专业人员操作荧光定量PCR仪器。
Test kit can not be used alone, the need for a professional operation of fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument.
一家基因测序公司的工作人员说，试剂盒适配的机型比较常见，多数医院能够开展检测，“一般3小时可以出结果。
A staff member at a genetic sequencing company says kit-fitting models are common and most hospitals are able to test them. "Results are generally available in three hours.
”一位科研人员补充，根据仪器规模不同，能够同时处理的检测样本“从几十到上百份不等”。
The number of samples that can be processed simultaneously "varies from tens to hundreds, depending on the size of the instrument," one researcher added.
由于新型冠状病毒被纳入甲类传染病管理，对这类高致病性病原微生物的样本检测和运输都提出很高要求。
As the new coronavirus is included in the management of A-type infectious diseases, the detection and transportation of samples of these highly pathogenic pathogenic microorganisms are very demanding.
武汉市卫健委在回应市民关切时提到，1月22日开始，首批10家“具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室”可以开展病原核酸检测工作，“预计全部运行起来每天可检测样本近2000份”。
Responding to public concerns, the Wuhan Health Commission said the first 10 "biosafety laboratories with appropriate levels of protection" would be able to carry out pathogen nucleic acid testing starting on January 22.
后续又增加了各区县级疾控中心及其他第三方检测机构。
This was followed by the addition of district-level CDC and other third-party testing agencies.
而在此前，武汉每天能够检测的样本约200多份，从1月16日湖北拥有试剂盒开始，开始采样到返回结果约需要2天左右，检测能力约300例。
Wuhan had been able to test more than 200 samples a day, starting with a test kit in Hubei Province on January 16, and about two days from the start of sampling to the return results, with a detection capacity of about 300 cases.
1月16日之前，由于“样本需要送至北京国家指定的检测机构，结果返回约需3-5天”。
By January 16, it would take about three to five days for the sample to be sent to a state-designated testing facility in Beijing.
1月30日，猛犸公益基金会试图以湖北为重点地区，在全国范围内征集约20家PCR医学实验室，向其提供资金和专业支持，使之快速提升检测能力。
On January 30, the Mammoth Foundation attempted to recruit around 20 PCR medical laboratories nationwide, focusing on Hubei, to provide them with financial and professional support to rapidly upgrade their testing capabilities.
该基金会表示，预计捐赠投入约千万元。
The foundation said it expects about $10 million in donations.
该基金会执行理事长王石在一份新闻稿中表示，“各地满足筛查条件和筛查能力的检测实验室数量有限，已有的实验室满负荷工作，无法满足短时间内对所有疑似病患进行病毒筛查与确诊。
"There are only a limited number of testing laboratories in all regions that meet screening conditions and screening capabilities, and existing laboratories are working at full capacity to meet the short time required to screen and confirm all suspected patients," Wang Shi, the foundation's executive director, said in a press release.
”这家公益组织称，现阶段最为便捷和有效的手段，是“对各地已有PCR检测资质的实验室，增加投入和改造硬件”，使其成为符合国家标准、能够确认新型冠状病毒所引发肺炎的医学实验室。
The commonweal group said the most convenient and effective way to do so at this stage would be to "invest in and adapt PCR-qualified laboratories around the world" as a medical laboratory that meets national standards and can identify pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus.
