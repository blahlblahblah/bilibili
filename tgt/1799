燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孔明明编辑 | 夏温疫情之下，企业正在面临严峻的挑战，也在迎接新一轮的机会。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
2月21日，燃财经举办“创新经济战疫计划” 第四期线上沙龙，主题聚焦于疫情之下的用人问题。
On February 21, Flaming Finance hosted the fourth online salon of the Innovative Economic Plague Program, which focused on employment issues in the face of the epidemic.
智联招聘CEO郭盛，知名组织创新专家、创业酵母创始人、原阿里巴巴集团组织发展专家张丽俊就“穿越疫情，企业应该如何处理人的问题？”进行了分享和问答互动。
ZhiLian recruitment CEO Guo Sheng, renowned organization innovation experts, founder of entrepreneurial yeast, former Alibaba Group organization development experts Zhang Lijun on "Crossing the epidemic, how enterprises should deal with human problems?" held a sharing and question-and-answer session.
曾在阿里巴巴工作过十数年的张丽俊，复盘了在阿里巴巴抗击非典的经验，并把这些经验在创业酵母复制，带领团队快速完成业务转型和架构调整，取得了一些线上转型的阶段性成果。
Zhang Lijun, who has worked in Alibaba for more than a decade, has replicated the experience of fighting SARS in Alibaba and replicated it in entrepreneurial yeast, leading the team to quickly complete business transformation and structural adjustments, with some phased results of online transformation.
在此之前，作为企业培训和咨询公司的创业酵母，90%营收均来自于线下。
Previously, 90% of revenue for startup yeast, a business training and consulting firm, came from offline sources.
“疫情之下，创业公司的机会和危险，都在于能否打通线上、线下”，张丽俊说，“当公司遭遇特别大的危机时，也是建设企业文化的契机，在调整业务过程中，最难的是抓住人心，你唯一有可能赢的概率是众志成城，而中国未来十年肯定是管理的红利，而不是创新的红利。
"The opportunity and danger for startups under the epidemic lies in the ability to connect online and offline," Zhang said. "When a company is in a particularly big crisis, it is also an opportunity to build a corporate culture.
”以下为张丽俊分享的详细内容：创业公司的机会和危险都在于能否打通线上线下今天我的分享有三个方面：第一方面，在目前情况下，创业公司的危险和机会在哪里？第二方面，在线化的机会在哪里？业务怎么调整？第三个方面我们讲战略变、架构变，那架构究竟该进行什么样的调整？1月25号，我从早上七点钟起床就很焦虑。
There are three aspects to my sharing today: First, where are the risks and opportunities for startups in the current situation? Second, where are the opportunities for going online? How do business adjust?
但我觉得作为老板，如果自己很焦虑，不能平静下来，就解决不了问题。
But I don't think that as a boss, you can't solve problems if you're anxious and can't calm down.
当时我大概有个判断：在这个情况下，打击比较大的会是三个行业：第一个是只有线下业务、没有第二条腿的行业；第二个是现金流比较少的中小型企业，基本上中小型民营企业的现金流都不会超过三个月；第三个，冲击最大的是服务行业。
At the time, I probably had a judgment: in this case, three industries would be hit harder: the first was an offline business with no second leg; the second was a small and medium-sized enterprise with less cash flow, and basically no more than three months of cash flow for small and medium-sized enterprises; the third was the service sector.
但同时我们看到医药板块增长特别快，很多企业在第一季度完成了一年的营收，另外拥有互联网流量的平台肯定躺赚，还有一些现金流比较充沛的公司，这时也比较有利。
But we also see a particularly rapid growth of the pharmaceutical sector, many companies in the first quarter of the year completed a year of revenue, in addition to the Internet traffic platform sure to lie down, there are some more cash-rich companies, at this time more favorable.
这次疫情会增加C2S2B和全球化的进程，在这个过程中，创业公司的机会和危险都在于能否把线上和线下打通，完成彻底的融合和转型。
In the process of increasing C2S2B and globalization, opportunities and risks for startups lie in the ability to connect online and offline to complete integration and transformation.
在深入分析了自己的公司以后，我发现这次战役是一个生死之战，或者叫做非常规战役。
After an in-depth analysis of my company, I found that the battle was a battle of life and death, or unconventional battle.
非常规战役的核心就是不走寻常路，以前的打法这时候不一定管用。
The core of the unconventional campaign is not to go the usual way, the previous play may not work at this time.
非常规战役很残酷，因为在变革的过程中，很有可能个人的力量、团队的力量、局部的利益都会牺牲掉，外部的竞争会加剧。
Unconventional warfare is brutal, because in the process of change, it is likely that individual strength, team strength, local interests will be sacrificed, and external competition will intensify.
非常规战役还需要把团队变成游击队作战模式，用年轻一代的说法就是未来组织的业态。
Unconventional campaigns also require turning teams into guerrilla warfare, or, as the younger generation puts it, the future organization.
游击队作战就是把人分散到各个区里面，总会有人星星之火、可以燎原。
Guerrilla warfare is to spread people into various districts, there will always be a spark, can start a prairie fire.
但大家不要以为游击队作战是把业务打散，在前线业务快速奔跑时，我们对总部和中台会有更高的要求，需要中台能够支持前线业务打仗，无论是产品、供应链敏捷度，还是数据中台的支持。
But let us not think that guerrilla warfare is a way to break up our business. In a fast-moving front-line operation, we will have higher demands on our headquarters and Taiwan, and we will need China Taiwan to be able to support frontline operations, be it products, supply chain agility, or data centre support.
企业转型线上的核心在于，你有没有洞察到你在做的在线生意的商业本质；第二个是产品；第三个是服务；第四个是营销；最后一个很重要，叫社群运营。
At the heart of the transformation line is whether you have any insight into the business nature of the online business you are doing; the second is a product; the third is a service; the fourth is marketing; and the last is important, called community operations.
复盘阿里巴巴非典战役两条经验、三条启示在这个过程中，我复盘了2003年非典时在阿里巴巴打过的那场战役，其中我个人认为有两条比较重要。
Two lessons from the battle of Ali Baba SARS, and three revelations in the process, I returned to the battle that SARS fought in Alibaba in 2003, two of which I personally think are more important.
第一条是组织的温度和高管的以身作则。
The first is the temperature of the organization and leadership by example.
我们当时的沟通工具是雅虎通，关明生担任阿里COO，每天早上马总（马云），还有他的太太张瑛，这些老板们每天会在雅虎通上叫大家起床，通过跳舞、唱歌等，把大家活跃起来，告诉大家，我们要饱满地开始工作了。
Our communication tool is Ya Hutong, Guan Mingsheng as Ali COO, every morning Ma Yun, and his wife Zhang Ying, these bosses will call everyone up every day on Yahoo!
我记得在那三个月，关明生每天都会给管理层打电话，问他们身体好不好，他们家里好不好。
I remember calling management every day for three months to ask how they were doing and how well they were at home.
组织的温度和关爱这个时候特别重要。
The temperature of the organization and caring for it are especially important at this time.
所以在阿里，马云被称为阿里爸爸、关明生被称为阿里妈妈。
So in Ali, Ma Yun was known as Ali's father and Guan Mingsheng as Ali's mother.
第二条，其实阿里在2003年非典之前，虽然有一个B2B网站的1.0版本，但基本上基因很传统，以销售驱动。
Second, in fact, Ali had a B2B site version 1.0 before SARS in 2003, but basically the genes were very traditional and sales-driven.
那时候无论商户还是买家，基本上都是通过销售人员一条腿把它跑进来的，或者我们的买家采购会把商家集采过来，再把这些内容翻到线上去。
At that time, both merchants and buyers basically ran it in through one leg of the salespeople, or our buyers would gather them and turn them over to the line.
但通过那次非典，我们完成了业务在线、协同在线、沟通在线、组织在线。
But through that SARS, we completed the business online, online coordination, online communication, organization online.
复盘之后我发现，阿里巴巴其实在2003年非典有很大收获：第一个收获是它的业务彻底把线上、线下打通；第二个是我们第一次觉得公司有文化了，其实当公司遭遇特别大的危机时，也是建设企业文化的契机；第三个阿里巴巴从默默无闻一下变成全国有名的网站，所有人都知道要做生意可以在网上通过阿里巴巴。
I found that Alibaba actually had a big harvest in 2003: the first was that its business was completely online and offline; the second was the first time we felt the company was literate. In fact, the third Alibaba went from obscurity to a nationally renowned website where everyone knew they could do business online through Alibaba.
另外，我也复盘了非典战役给现在带来的启示：第一个是风险意识，所有的老板都会知道，鸡蛋不能放在一个篮子里面，所以他们都会多条腿走路；第二个是活在当下不够，必须有长远的打算；第三个是这次疫情也会改变每个商人的思维，改变14亿人民的生活习惯。
The first is risk awareness. All bosses know that eggs cannot be put in one basket, so they all walk on more than one leg. The second is to live in the present without enough time to plan ahead. The third is that the outbreak will change the mindset of every businessman and change the habits of 1.4 billion people.
调整组织时如何抓住人心？唯一赢的概率是众志成城我们公司在11天内完成了从线下业务到线上业务的变革。
The only chance of winning was that our company completed the transformation from offline to online in 11 days.
在调整业务的过程中，其实最难的是抓住人心，因为这时候你唯一有可能赢的概率就是众志成城，所以在这个过程中我们进行了非常详细的层层沟通。
In the process of business adjustment, the most difficult thing is to catch people's hearts, because the only chance that you will win at this time is in the city, so we have a very detailed communication in the process.
1月29号早上，我跟公司股东开始沟通，下午跟高管一对一沟通。
On the morning of January 29, I began to communicate with the company's shareholders and one-on-one with the executives in the afternoon.
我跟高管一对一沟通的目的是为了挑选谁能过来跟我打仗，不是所有高管和老人都可以帮你打仗，这其中应该要有人才画像。
The purpose of my one-on-one communication with the executives is to choose who can come and fight against me. Not all executives and senior citizens can fight for you.
接下来我开始跟全体管理层沟通，沟通完之后，我们用三天时间，管理层先行动，取得一定成果后，再跟全员沟通。
Then I began to communicate with the entire management, after the communication, we took three days, management first, achieved some results, and then communicate with the entire staff.
其中在沟通时有一些技巧。
There are some skills in communication.
第一，你跟决策层沟通，很容易达成共识，如果这会儿你跟你的决策层都不能达成共识，我觉得你们之前可能有很多问题。
First, you communicate with the decision makers, it's easy to reach a consensus, and if you and your decision makers can't agree at this point, I think you might have a lot of problems before.
第二，高管一定要一对一沟通，因为你要判断谁是你要挑出来作为特种部队的人，我把公司的核心骨干，以及认为有潜力的人也一起访谈。
Second, executives must communicate on a one-on-one basis, because you have to decide who you want to pick out as a special forces officer, and I talk to the company's core cadre, as well as people who think there is potential.
在困难的时候确实很多人顶不上，但我们一定要相信在困难的时候一定会出现Super Man。
It's true that many people can't handle difficult times, but we have to believe in Super Man when times are tough.
那天我从下午一点半到晚上十点钟之前全在沟通，连水都没喝，快速把领导班子抓了出来。
I was in communication from 1: 30 p.m. to 10: 00 p.m. that day. I didn't even drink water.
第三，你应该有一个全景图，你要告诉全员管理层他们为什么要这么干，因为这帮人必须要知其所以然，要理解这件事情怎么做。
Third, you should have a panorama, and you have to tell the full management why they do it, because these people have to understand why and how to do it.
创新班子需要的能力模型有四个：开放的人、有超级学习能力的人、客户第一的人、使命感驱动的人。
Innovation teams need four competency models: open people, super-learners, customer-first people, and mission-driven people.
在这个过程中，我们要激励人心，一定要先把这帮将军激励起来。
In this process, we must inspire the people, we must first inspire the generals.
危机很重要，但更重要的是要给他们方法和目标。
Crises were important, but it was more important to give them methods and goals.
在跟员工沟通时，大家一定要注意法理情还是情理法，这是管理常识。
When communicating with employees, we must pay attention to the legal reasoning or rational law, which is common management knowledge.
我们老板在做业务判断时，应该是法理情这个顺序；但我们跟员工沟通的时候恰恰相反，要按照情理法顺序。
When our boss makes business judgments, he should follow the order of reasoning; but when we communicate with employees, we should follow the order of reasoning.
这其中我们没有任何降薪和裁员，有50%的人干不了新业务，我就让他们天天练，我告诉他们把新业务练好，一定有用得上的时候，其实我在等一个前面部队打胜仗的机会。
We didn't have any pay cuts or layoffs, and 50 percent of the people couldn't do new business, so I let them do it every day. I told them to practice their new business and it would be useful.
在现在情况下，基本上所有的公司都想着裁员，但这个时候如果要裁员，还是淘汰那些技巧不好，或者说不愿意跟你承担责任的员工，剩余的那些愿意跟着公司干的人，我们应该有责任赋予他新的能力去做新的业务，这是老板的责任。
In today's situation, most companies want to lay off workers, but it's the responsibility of the boss to lay off workers, eliminate those with poor skills, or those who don't want to take responsibility for you, and those who are willing to go with the company.
我认为中国未来十年肯定是管理的红利，而不是创新的红利。
I think the next decade in China is definitely a management dividend, not an innovation dividend.
未来五到十年，基本上除了科技迭代之外，就是每个企业如何降本增效，用好互联网转型，本质都是在提高企业效能。
In the next five to ten years, apart from basically technological iterations, it is how each enterprise can reduce its costs and efficiency, and how to use the Internet to transform itself is in essence improving the efficiency of the enterprise.
