记者/颜星悦编辑/石爱华 宋建华莫斯科谢列梅捷沃国际机场一名乘客戴着防护口罩站在售票处2月26日，新冠肺炎疫情在世界范围内出现了一个意外“拐点”。
BEIJING, Feb. 26 (Xinhua) -- A passenger wearing a face mask stands at the ticket office at the Seremeev International Airport in Moscow. The new crown pneumonia outbreak has reached an unexpected "inflection point" worldwide.
根据世卫组织的数据，中国境外新增病例首次超过中国（中国411例，世界其它国家和地区427例），其中韩国、伊朗、意大利北部等地区出现疫情激增现象。
For the first time, new cases outside China exceed China's (411 in China and 427 in the rest of the world), with surges in South Korea, Iran and northern Italy, according to the WHO.
由于人们对病毒传播的未知、恐惧和误会，一些旅居国外的华人被贴上“新冠肺炎”的标签，面对着被歧视的目光。
Some Chinese living abroad have been branded as "New Crown Pneumonia" in the face of discrimination because of the unknown, fear and misunderstanding about the virus's spread.
有些人像害怕病毒一样与中国人保持着“安全距离”，外媒把这种心理和行为称为“恐华症”或“恐中症”。
Some people maintain a "safe distance" from the Chinese like fear of the virus, which foreign media call phobia or phobia.
比起在当地扎根的华人华侨，“漂”在国外的留学生群体感受到的“恐华症”更明显。
Compared with the local Chinese rooted in the overseas Chinese, "drift" in the overseas students feel more "phobia" more obvious.
深一度记者采访了四名分别在俄罗斯、荷兰、意大利和韩国留学的中国学生，他们有人被请进过“小黑屋”，有人在公共场所被直呼“冠状病毒”，也有人改变了人生选择。
At one point, the reporter interviewed four Chinese students studying in Russia, the Netherlands, Italy and South Korea, some of whom had been invited to the "small black room," others had been called "coronavirus" in public places, and some had changed their life choices.
在意大利留学的中国学生余婕可以理解新冠肺炎带来的“距离感”，但她认为，种种预防措施不应该只针对中国人进行，她试图向身边的人解释，“感染病毒的不只中国人，每一个人都该做好防范”。
Yu Jie, a Chinese student studying in Italy, understood the "distance" caused by pneumonia, but said preventive measures should not be aimed at the Chinese alone. She tried to explain to those around her that "it's not just the Chinese who have the virus, everyone should be on guard."
中国驻俄大使馆向莫斯科政府递交照会莫斯科的“硬核管理”截至目前，俄罗斯报出5例新冠肺炎确诊病例，其中2人已康复。
The Chinese embassy in Russia has handed over a note to the Moscow government on "hard nuclear management" in Moscow. So far, Russia has reported five confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia, two of whom have recovered.
疫情发生后，俄当局采取了严格的防疫措施。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, the Russian authorities took strict preventive measures.
2月18日，俄罗斯政府主管卫生事务副总理戈利科娃宣布，“2月20日起禁止所有中国公民因工作旅行、私人旅行、教育或观光目的，从俄罗斯边界入境。
On 18 February, the Deputy Prime Minister for Health of the Russian Government, Nikolai Golikova, announced that "as of February 20, all Chinese citizens are prohibited from entering the Russian border for the purposes of work travel, private travel, education or tourism.
”据俄罗斯体报道，莫斯科官员命令警察搜查旅店、宿舍、公寓楼和商店以“追查”中国人，并在莫斯科的公交车、地铁和电车等公共交通上，利用人脸识别技术追踪中国人动态。
Russian sources reported that Moscow officials ordered police to search hotels, dormitories, apartment buildings and shops to "track" the Chinese, and used face-recognition technology to track Chinese movements on public transport such as buses, subways and trams in Moscow.
周云婷是被“追踪”的中国人之一，她在莫斯科一所大学里读大三，在搭乘地铁时被俄罗斯警察带进了“小黑屋”问话。
Zhou Yunting is one of the "traced" Chinese, a junior at a Moscow university, who was taken by Russian police to the "little black room" for questioning on the subway.
2月24日，周云婷从学校附近搭乘地铁到红场办事，进站刷卡时，几名警察走过来要求查看她的证件，并未解释原因。
On Feb. 24, Zhou Yun Ting from the school near the subway to Red Square office, entered the station to swipe the card, several police officers came to ask to see her identity card, did not explain why.
周云婷按照要求出示了护照、签证和移民卡。
Zhou Yun Ting showed her passport, visa and immigration card as required.
随后，她被带到地铁站里一个封闭的房间内。
She was then taken to a closed room in the subway station.
“先要通过一扇密码门，之后穿过一条昏暗的走廊，房间在走廊尽头。
"It had to go through a cipher door and then through a dark hallway at the end of the hallway.
”周云婷回忆，房间没有窗户，只有一张桌子和一条长凳，她被安排在长凳上坐下。
Zhou Yunting recalled that the room had no windows but a table and a bench and she was seated on a bench.
“长凳旁边，是那种关押犯人的小隔间。
Next to the bench is the sort of cell in which prisoners are confined.
”警察把周云婷的信息输入电脑，然后向她问话，“内容包括什么时候到的莫斯科，去了哪里，有没有回过中国，然后给我拍了照。
"The police entered Zhou's message into the computer and then asked her," When did you arrive in Moscow, where you went, whether you've ever returned to China, and then you took pictures of me.
”这不是周云婷第一次被警方拍照，从2月22日到2月25日，周云婷在不同的地方一共被拍过4次照片。
It was not the first time Zhou had been photographed by police, and Zhou was photographed four times in different places from February 22 to February 25.
2月22日中午，警察来到学校，召集所有中国学生，在寝室楼下逐个拍照、登记证件，这是周云婷第一次登记拍照。
At noon on 22 February, the police came to the school, gathered all the Chinese students, in the bedroom downstairs, one by one, photo registration, this is Zhou Yun Ting's first photo registration.
2月24日，周云婷在地铁站的房间经历了第二次拍照，她在“小黑屋”里等待了二十分钟才被允许离开。
Zhou, who took her second photo in a subway station room on Feb. 24, was allowed to leave after waiting for 20 minutes in the "little black room."
当天，她在红场出站的时候，又被警察叫住登记、拍照。
On the same day, she was out of Red Square, the police stopped her registration, took photos.
2月25日中午，警方再次来到学校，给中国留学生拍照。
At noon on February 25, the police came to the school again to take pictures of Chinese students.
“莫斯科政府正在使用大数据技术，我们每个人（中国人）被拍了照后，通过街上的摄像头，我们的行踪就能被看到。
"The Moscow government is using big data technology, and every one of us [the Chinese] is photographed and our whereabouts can be seen through the cameras on the street.
”周云婷告诉记者。
Zhou Yunting told reporters.
事实上，周云婷从2019年8月底到莫斯科后，从未回过中国，“寒假去了摩洛哥和摩尔曼斯克游玩，这些警方都有记录。
Indeed, since arriving in Moscow at the end of August 2019, Zhou has never returned to China, "visiting Morocco and Murmansk during the winter vacation, which the police have recorded.
”周云婷觉得自己还算幸运，她的一个朋友，在地铁上被查证件后，直接被送到了医院强制隔离。
Zhou Yun-ting felt lucky that one of her friends, who had been checked on the subway, had been taken directly to a hospital for forced isolation.
“我的两个室友，春节回家过年，目前已经无法入境回来上学了。
"My two roommates, who come home for the Spring Festival, have been unable to enter the country to go back to school.
”周云婷所在学校，中国学生都被要求隔离，周云婷也不得不搬去一个新的空宿舍，不管是否在疫情期间回过中国，每个中国学生都要在下午4点去宿管处量体温。
Zhou's school, where Chinese students were ordered to be kept in isolation, and Zhou Yunting had to move to a new empty dormitory, where every Chinese student had to take his temperature at 4 p. m., whether or not he had returned to China during the outbreak.
受影响的还有正常上课。
Regular classes were also affected.
周云婷介绍，从这个学期开始，中国学生去教学楼上课，必须在教学楼偏门测量体温后才能进入，“我们有电子卡，本来一刷就进去，现在中国学生的电子卡都失效了。
'From this semester, Chinese students will have to go to the classroom building to have their temperature taken at the door of the building before they can enter, 'said Zhou.
”周云婷说，这些措施针对的只有中国人，俄罗斯本地人和其他国家的人并没有受到任何管理。
Mr Zhou said the measures were aimed only at the Chinese, and that Russians and people from other countries were not subject to any kind of regulation.
2月24日，中国驻俄使馆向莫斯科市政府递交照会称：中方注意到莫斯科公交、地铁和部分执法机构以防控新型冠状病毒为理由，有针对性地只对华人进行检查，要求填表等举动，类似现象在美国和其他西方国家都是没有的。
On February 24, the Chinese Embassy in Russia sent a note to the Moscow city government, saying that China has noticed that Moscow's bus, subway and some law enforcement agencies are targeting only Chinese people to check for the new coronavirus on the grounds of preventing and controlling the new coronavirus.
中方理解抗疫措施的必要性，但考虑中俄高度友好关系，希望市政府采取“适度、非歧视”的措施。
China understands the need for measures to combat the epidemic, but considering the high level of friendly relations between China and Russia, we hope the municipal government will take appropriate and non-discriminatory measures.
荷兰华裔女生在电梯里阻止当地人哼唱辱华歌曲后被捅伤，她在脸书上发布了情况说明被直呼“病毒”的荷兰留学生彭莉珍在荷兰鹿特丹伊拉姆斯大学读书，2018年来到荷兰之后，彭莉珍从未受到过任何不公正对待，可最近情况发生了变化。
Chinese-Dutch schoolgirl who was stabbed in an elevator to stop local people from singing degrading songs posted an information note on her face that Peng Lijen, a Dutch student who was called "Virus," studied at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and had never been treated unfairly since arriving in 2018, but things have changed recently.
2月20日下午1点左右，彭莉珍在鹿特丹Schenkel地铁站附近走路，一个四五十岁的男人突然迎面走来，“他看见我就对着我吼corona corona, 然后还说了几句荷兰语，语气很凶，我听不懂，听到他叫我corona（冠状病毒）才知道他是在用语言攻击我。
On February 20, at about 1 p.m., while she was walking near the Schenkel subway station in Rotterdam, a man in her 40s and 50s suddenly came up to me. "He saw me yell at me corona corona, and then he spoke a few Dutch words that I couldn't understand and heard him call me corona.
”彭莉珍还没有来得及做出反应，这名男子就转身走了。
Before she could respond, the man turned away.
不久前，彭莉珍在学校华人学生会里听说过类似的事情，“地铁里有一些荷兰人，看到中国人就吼他们，很多同学都遭遇过这样的事情，还有同学被打。
"There are some Dutch people in the subway who yell at them when they see the Chinese people. A lot of students have been through this kind of thing and others have been beaten.
”彭莉珍也在蒂尔堡大学念过书，她听同学说，一名华裔女生因为在电梯里劝阻别人唱辱华歌曲挨了刀子。
Ms. Peng, who also studied at Tilburg University, heard a Chinese-American girl get stabbed for trying to dissuade people from singing vulgar songs in an elevator.
“她被人拿东西砸破了头，流了很多血，然后有人拿刀划开了她的肚子。
"She was hit on the head with something, there was a lot of blood, and someone cut her in the stomach with a knife.
”据荷兰RTL新闻报道，这位华裔女生24岁，名叫Cindy。
The 24-year-old Chinese is named Cindy, according to Dutch news agency RTL.
Cindy Tsang事后在自己的Facebook上发表声明称：“我站在电梯里，他们走了进来，开始唱一首关于冠状病毒的狂欢节歌曲，我叫他们停下来，然后他们推我，拔出刀子说他们会消灭冠状病毒。
"I was standing in the elevator and they came in and started singing a carnival song about the coronavirus, and I told them to stop, and then they pushed me and pulled out their knives and said they would destroy the coronavirus," Cindy Tsang said later on her Facebook page.
”在电梯里引发Cindy不适的歌曲叫做《Voorkomen is beter dan Chinezen》，被改编的歌词写道：“都是臭气熏天的中国人的错”、“不要吃中国菜，否则你会感染冠状病毒。
The song that caused Cindy's discomfort in the elevator was called "Voorkwomen is beter dan Chinezen," and the lyrics were adapted to read: "It's all the fault of smelly Chinese" and "Don't eat Chinese food, or you'll catch the coronavirus.
”虽然荷兰目前只有一人确诊，但彭莉珍还是感受到了周边人态度的变化。
Although only one person has been diagnosed in the Netherlands, she feels a change in attitude around her.
前两天，她还遇到一个喜欢中国文化的荷兰人，他在地铁上用中文跟彭莉珍聊天，说为中国的疫情感到难过。
Two days ago, she also met a Dutchman who liked Chinese culture. He talked to Peng Lizhen in Chinese on the subway and said he was sad about the outbreak in China.
“但我们两个在说中文的时候，旁边就有人拿手机拍我们，我不知道这是为什么。
"But the two of us were speaking Chinese and someone was shooting us with a cell phone. I don't know why.
”彭莉珍说，虽然这只是一小部分人，但她还是很难过。
"Although it was only a small number of people, she was sad," she said.
境外也出现了“口罩荒”一天三次遭遇不公正对待相比荷兰，意大利的“恐华”情绪更加明显。
There has also been a "face mask shortage" outside the country three times a day to encounter injustice compared to the Netherlands, Italy's "fear of China" more obvious.
截止至2月28日15时，意大利共有655人确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎，45人死亡，已经成为亚洲以外感染人数最多的国家。
As of 1500 hours February 28, a total of 655 people in Italy had confirmed the new coronavirus pneumonia, with 45 deaths, making it the country outside Asia with the highest number of infections.
而在21日之前，意大利仅有3例确诊。
Only three cases were diagnosed in Italy before the 21st.
疫情来势汹汹，意大利民众陷入空前恐慌，多地超市出现抢购潮，大批民众前往超市购买食物、消毒用品、口罩等，大部分超市货架基本都被清空。
The epidemic is raging, Italians are in unprecedented panic, there is a rush to buy more supermarkets, large numbers of people are going to supermarkets to buy food, disinfectant supplies, masks, etc., and most supermarket shelves have been emptied.
在对病毒的恐慌中，一些意大利人把“攻击”目标对准了中国人。
In a panic over the virus, some Italians have targeted the Chinese.
正在意大利佩鲁贾外国人大学读书的中国学生余婕（化名）告诉记者，在过去两天，她遭遇了四次不公平对待，其中同一天就有三次。
Yu Jie, a Chinese student studying at Perugia University for Foreigners, told reporters she had been treated unfairly four times in the past two days, three on the same day.
2月23日下午，余婕和另外两名中国学生在住所附近超市排队结账。
On the afternoon of February 23, Yu Jie and two other Chinese students queued up at the supermarket near their home.
等待期间，余婕和同学们用中文探讨晚上的菜单。
During the waiting period, Yu Jie and her classmates discussed the evening menu in Chinese.
“前面一个四十多岁的妇女突然就转过来，隔着三、四米让我们离远一点，不要说话，还对我们做出快走开的手势。
"Suddenly a woman in her forties turned and told us to stay away from us three or four metres away, without speaking, and gesturing away.
” 余婕说。
"said Yu.
这是余婕第一次在意大利受到当地人的“排挤”，她立刻进行了反驳，告诉这位阿姨，新冠病毒带来的危害不分国籍，不能只针对中国人，意大利人也需要带口罩。
It was the first time she had been ostracized by locals in Italy, and she immediately countered, telling the aunt that the new crown virus was not just a national hazard, not just for Chinese, but also for Italians.
余婕希望自己的解释可以缓解误会。
Yu Jie hopes her explanation will ease the misunderstanding.
“但对方并不耐烦，让我们不要再说了。
"But the other side is not impatient. Let's not say that again.
”余婕还没有从超市事件的“阴影”中走出来，第二天类似事件接踵而至。
Yu Jie has not yet emerged from the "shadow" of the supermarket incident, which followed the next day.
2月24日中午下课，余婕和中国同学一起在食堂吃饭，一个意大利男学生坐在他们身后，对他们比划出侮辱性的手势。
February 24 noon class, Yu Jie and Chinese students eating in the canteen, an Italian boy sitting behind them, making insulting gestures.
当天放学后，余婕和朋友决定去超市多采购一些食物。
After school that day, Yu Jie and her friends decided to go to the supermarket to buy more food.
在翁布里亚区的Pincetto地铁站，余婕和朋友们正要进站，两个走在前面的意大利中年女人突然说：“ 有中国人。
Two middle-aged Italian women walking in front of her, Jet and friends, suddenly said: "There are Chinese," at the Pincetto subway station in Umbria district.
” 说完之后立马走远。
"And away they went.
走进地铁车厢的时候，两名意大利女子再次出现，她们对车厢里的乘客大声说：“不要坐这一班车，他们是中国人，快点离他们远一点。
When they got into the subway car, two Italian women showed up and shouted to the passengers: "Don't take this bus. They are Chinese. Stay away from them.
” 令余婕安慰的是，大多数乘客没有理会。
To her consolation, most passengers ignored her.
在从超市回寝室的路上，余婕遇到四五个意大利年轻人，有男有女，说说笑笑。
On the way back from the supermarket, Yu Jie met four or five young Italians, men and women, talking and laughing.
他们看到余婕就说，“中国人！病毒！”一边说着，还向余婕和朋友们比出中午食堂里看到的手势。
When they saw Yu Jie, they said, "Chinese! Virus!" and pointed out to Yu Jie and her friends the signs they had seen in the cafeteria at noon.
余婕说，大多数意大利人还是善解人意的，对于这些不友好的行为，“一开始是气愤，到现在是难过。
Most Italians were understanding, Yu said, referring to the unkind behavior, "initially angry, but now sad.
”余婕和朋友们最近都特别想回家。
"Yu and her friends had been dying to go home recently.
她已经查了机票，但是由于意大利已经停止了对中国的商业航班往来，一直到五月份都没有回国的机票可以买。
She has checked her ticket, but since Italy has suspended commercial flights to and from China, it is not possible to buy a ticket home until May.
韩国个别商店贴出“中国人禁止出入”她往前走 房东往后退除中国外，韩国已经成为新冠肺炎疫情的第二大战场。
South Korea has become the second-largest battleground for the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, with individual shops posting "Chinese no-go" ahead and landlords retreating to China.
2月28日，韩国新冠病毒病例升至2022人。
On February 28, the number of cases rose to 2,022.
关静怡在韩国读书，是中国香港人。
Kwan studied in Korea and is from Hong Kong, China.
2019年12月24日她放假回国，假期期间，她曾到苏州游玩，元旦前夕返回香港， 2月22日关静怡回到韩国。
She returned to Hong Kong on the eve of the New Year's Day and returned to the Republic of Korea on 22 February.
在入境韩国时，海关让她上报手机号。
On entering South Korea, customs asked her to report her cell phone number.
关静怡了解，从2月12日开始，每个中国入境者需安装“自我诊断APP”，主动申报健康状况，关静怡也被要求下载了这个应用软件。
Since February 12, Guan Jingyi has been required to install a self-diagnosis APP to voluntarily declare their health status. Guan was also required to download the application.
“页面上有一个表格，需要自己填写是否有发烧等不适症状，每天提交。
"There is a form on the page that needs to be filled in for symptoms such as fever every day.
”关静怡听说，如果不提交的话，会有人“找上门”。
Guan Jingyi heard that if she did not submit, someone would "come looking for her."
韩国中央应急处置部发布的通知要求：中国入境者每天早晨10点都会收到“输入自我诊断信息”的提醒，如果忘记输入的话，将在同一天下午2点到4点接到追加输入的通知，如果多次拒不输入的话，韩国防疫部门将会进行电话联络，韩国警察厅也将采取相应措施。
According to the circular issued by the Korea Central Emergency Management Agency, Chinese immigrants will receive a "self-diagnosis message" every morning at 10: 00am. If they forget to enter, they will be notified of the additional input between 2: 00pm and 4: 00pm on the same day.
2月22晚上8点，回到韩国的关静怡准备出门采购，在公寓楼下，关静怡遇到了房东。
Feb. 22 at 8 p.m., returned to the Republic of Korea Guan Jingyi ready to go shopping, under the apartment building, Guan Jingyi met the landlord.
当时，房东正在大门口清理垃圾，“他见到我皱起眉，我跟他打招呼，他看见我向他走过去，结果他直往后退。
"When he saw me frown and I greeted him, he saw me walking towards him and he backed away.
““房东是一个六七十岁的韩国大叔，平时是很热情的那一种。
The landlord is a sixty or seventy-year-old Korean uncle, usually a very warm kind.
” 关静怡用敬语客气地打招呼，房东却问她：“你们中国人把病毒传到韩国来，你们难道没有想过要怎么去处理吗？” 关静怡注意到，房东跟她说话时没有用敬语，语气也很差。
Guan Jingyi greeted her politely, but the landlord asked her, "Don't you think about how to deal with the virus when you Chinese send it to Korea?" Guan noted that the landlord didn't use salutes when she spoke to her, and the tone was bad.
在这之前，他们都是互相用敬语称呼的。
Before that, they had all used salutes to each other.
关静怡还没有想好怎么回答，房东就让她赶紧离开。
Guan Jing Yi has not thought how to answer, landlord lets her hasten to leave.
关静怡还发现，如果走在街上用中文说话，周围的韩国人就会投来异样目光，有些人还会躲开。
Ms. Guan also found that if she spoke in Chinese on the street, South Koreans would look differently around her, and some would avoid it.
回到住处后，关静怡开始在宿舍自我隔离，满14天后，她将拿到一个隔离证明回到学校上课。
Returning to her apartment, Guan started isolating herself in the dorm and, 14 days later, she would be given an isolation certificate to return to school.
韩国人在光华门集会那天，关静怡在微信朋友圈里密切关注着动向，她看到有一些人举着牌子，上面写着“China Out”。
On the day of the rally in Guanghua Gate, Guan watched closely in Weixin's circle of friends and saw people carrying signs that said, "China Out."
关静怡还发现，在一些便利店的门外，贴着“中国人不准进”的标语，最近有一些朋友去餐厅吃饭，也被服务员拒绝进门。
Guan also found signs saying "No Chinese allowed" outside some convenience stores, and recently some friends went to restaurants where waiters refused to come in.
她很是担心，3月份开学之后，会遭到同学的排挤。
She was worried that she would be ostracized by her classmates after school began in March.
最近发生的事情让关静怡重新规划了未来的工作计划，“我原本打算，韩国或中国哪边有合适的机会就留在哪边，现在我还是想要回国”。
Recent events have prompted Ms. Guan to re-plan her future work. "I was going to stay where I wanted to be, either in Korea or China, and now I want to go home."
