文/胡月从2019年年底开始，一款名为《健身环大冒险》的Switch游戏在社交网站上迅速走红。
Beginning in late 2019, a Switzerland game called "Fitness Ring Adventure" is fast gaining popularity on social networking sites.
在这款主打健身功能的游戏中，你需要通过做出相应的健身动作释放技能，一路打怪升级，推进剧情。
In this fitness-oriented game, you need to release your fitness skills, upgrade the game, and push the plot forward.
将枯燥的健身运动游戏化，或许正是这款游戏受到网友青睐的原因。
Will be a boring fitness game, perhaps this game is favored by the netizens.
但令人惊讶的是，随着新冠肺炎疫情的突然爆发，这款游戏的需求量在春节期间骤增，导致游戏价格一路水涨船高，如今电商平台上的售价已超发售价的3倍。
But surprisingly, with the outbreak of pneumonia, demand for the game has soared during the Spring Festival, driving up the price of the game, which now costs three times as much as the price on a commercial platform.
骤增的需求，飙涨的价格2019年10月，Switch游戏《健身环大冒险》正式发布。
Surging demand, soaring prices October 2019, the Switch game "Fitness Ring Adventure" was officially released.
凭借健身主题以及“国民老婆”新垣结衣的加持，游戏上市前发布的预告片便已吸引了很多玩家。
With the fitness theme and the addition of the "National Wife," the trailer released before the game has attracted many players.
图片来源：《健身环大冒险》预告片截图随后，随着各大博主、UP主相继推出测评、试玩视频，这款游戏在社交平台迅速火爆。

发售价约558元的游戏，去年底在电商平台上的价格就已接近700元。
The price of the game, which costs about 558 yuan, was close to 700 yuan at the end of last year.
当时，不少网友都认为价格被炒得过高，决定观望一阵再做打算。
At that time, many netizens thought the price was fired too high, decided to wait and see for a while before making plans.
但谁也没有想到，期望中的降价没有等到，随着新冠肺炎的突然爆发，游戏的价格反而一路水涨船高。
But no one expected that the expected price reduction did not wait, as the sudden outbreak of pneumonia, the price of the game all the way up.
2月10日，这款游戏在电商平台上的最高售价已超1500元，并持续上涨，如今甚至接近1900元，已达发售价的3倍。
The game, which sold for more than 1,500 yuan on the commercial platform on Feb. 10, has continued to rise and is now close to 1,900 yuan, three times the price of the product.
2月10日，有网友发微博吐槽游戏价格▼图片来源：微博截图2月17日的价格，大家感受一下▼即使是在二手交易平台上，只玩过几次成色较新的游戏，价格也已经超过千元。
Why don't you Why don't we Why don't we Why don't we Why don't we Why don't we Why don't we go over our second-hand trading platform
这款游戏为什么这么火？传统的健身方式比较枯燥，需要不停地重复相同的动作，对于意志薄弱的健身新手来说非常“劝退”，这也是很多人一直在计划健身但从未真正开始的原因。
Why is the game so hot? Traditional fitness methods are boring, require repetitive motions, and are very "dissuasive" for weak-willed novices, which is why many people have been planning to get fit but never really started.
而将健身与游戏相结合，就将原本枯燥的运动变得有趣了很多，游戏自带的即时反馈机制也让玩家能够第一时间看到健身的成果。
Combining fitness with games makes otherwise boring sports a lot more fun, and the instant feedback mechanism allows players to see the results of fitness in the first place.
而除了娱乐性之外，这款游戏还有一定的观赏性，再加上游戏自带的热度，选择录制试玩视频的博主和UP主自然不在少数，无形中增加了这款游戏的曝光度。
In addition to entertainment, the game has a certain amount of appreciation, coupled with the game's own heat, choose to record video game owners and UP owners naturally many, increased the exposure of the game.
另外，游戏内的排行榜功能除了具有一定的激励作用外，也是吸引玩家的一大要素。
In addition, the in-game ranking function not only has a certain incentive role, but also is a major factor in attracting players.
热衷为自己“打榜”的朋友们，这下终于找到了抢占微信步数排行第一之外的乐趣。
Enthusiastic for their "list" friends, this finally found the number one preemptive micro-steps outside the fun.
当然，《健身环大冒险》的爆火也有偶然因素在内。
Of course, Fitness Ring Adventures also had an accidental element.
春节前突发的新冠肺炎疫情导致很多人只能宅在家里，严重缺乏运动。
Spring Festival before the outbreak of pneumonia caused many people can only stay at home, a serious lack of exercise.
对于长期健身或是有健身需求的人来说，这款游戏确实具有一定的专业性。
For long-term fitness or fitness needs of the people, the game does have a certain degree of professionalism.
游戏搭配的外设可以看做是一个普拉提圈，而游戏中涉及的动作也多为普拉提动作。
The game's peripheral may be thought of as a Pilates loop, and the actions involved in the game are mostly those of Pilates.
B站UP主@灵魂健身杨老师就曾发布过一则视频，从专业角度分析了这款游戏是否具有健身功能，答案是肯定的。
The game has a fitness function, and the answer is yes, according to a video released by Ms. Yang, who studies the game from a professional perspective.
图片来源：B站UP主@灵魂健身杨老师视频截图据他估算，如果标准地完成动作，打两次大BOSS就可以消耗200~300大卡。
According to his calculations, two large BOSS hits can consume 200 to 300 kilocalories if the action is done correctly.
而对于宅在家太久，只是想随意活动活动筋骨的人来说，这款游戏也比枯燥地跟着健身APP练习来得有趣很多。
For people who stay at home too long and just want to get active, the game is much more fun than a boring APP workout.
另外，受疫情的影响，目前这款游戏仍处于缺货状态。
In addition, affected by the epidemic, the game is still out of stock.
需求与供给严重不对等的情况下，游戏的价格会被炒至“天价”也就不难理解了。
Demand and supply are seriously unequal, the price of the game will be fired "sky-high" is not difficult to understand.
越来越专业的健身游戏事实上，健身与游戏的结合早已不是什么新鲜事。
In fact, the combination of fitness and games is nothing new.
1998年，日本科乐美（KONAMI）公司推出了一款视频游戏——《Dance Dance Revolution》（以下简称《DDR》），也就是我们熟知的跳舞机。
In 1998, KONAMI launched a video game, Dance Dance Revolution (hereinafter referred to as "DDR"), known as a dance machine.
在大部分80后、90后的童年记忆里，跳舞机绝对是游戏厅里的风云项目，如今早已更新换代▼图片来源：DRS舞律炫步官方抖音号随后，这种新鲜的机器在美国、日本等国家迅速走红。
Why don't you tell me why? Why don't you tell me why? Why don't you tell me why? Why don't you tell me about it? Why don't you tell me about it. Why don't you tell me about it.
此前曾有不少研究证实了它的健身功用：即使是初级游戏水平，游戏时间超过一小时，就有助于儿童减轻体重。
Previous studies have confirmed its fitness benefits: Playing for more than an hour at the primary level can help children lose weight.
因此，当时很多美国家长用《DDR》来帮助自己的孩子控制体重，强健体魄。
As a result, many American parents used DDR to help their children gain weight and fitness.
而随着这类新生事物的出现，人们将 exercise（运动健身）与video game（视频游戏）结合，制造出一个专有名词——Exergame，即运动电子游戏。
With the advent of this new breed of sport, the combination of excise (exercise) and video game (video game) has created a proper nouns - Exergamme.
事实上，在《健身环大冒险》爆火前，各大主机游戏平台都曾推出过运动电子游戏。
In fact, before the "Fitness Ring Adventure," major mainframe gaming platforms had launched video games.
比如Wii平台上的《Wii Fit》、XBOX 360体感周边外设Kinect配套发布的游戏《Kinect Sports》《Kinect Adventure》等。
Examples include Wii Fit on the Wii platform, Kinect Sports and Kind Adventure, a companion game to the XBOX 360 Body Periphery.
而在《健身环大冒险》之前，Switch就已相继推出了《有氧拳击》和由育碧发行的《舞力全开》，这三款游戏如今也被网友称为Switch“铁人三项”。
And before Fitness Rings, Switch has already launched Aerobic Boxing and Dancing with Your Bite, which are now referred to online as the witch triathlon.
图片来源：微博截图从健身游戏的更新迭代中我们可以发现，健身游戏在保留自身娱乐性的同时也在逐渐变得更加专业化。

健身游戏会冲击健身行业吗？与健身游戏销售火爆相对应的是传统健身房的惨淡现状。
Fitness game will impact the fitness industry? And fitness game sales hot corresponding to the status quo of the traditional gymnasium.
最近两年，包括浩沙在内的传统健身房深陷“倒闭潮”，行业内一直采用的预付卡模式也屡遭诟病。
In the past two years, traditional gyms, including Haosha, have been in the throes of bankruptcy, and the prepaid-card model that the industry has been adopting has been criticized.
而突然爆发的疫情，更加重了传统健身房的压力。
The sudden outbreak of the disease has added to the pressure on the traditional gymnasium.
不过，行业内也因此出现了一些新趋势，健身教练们纷纷变身“主播”，直播上课，线上健身一度火爆。
However, the industry has also seen a number of new trends, fitness coaches have become "anchor", live classes, online fitness once hot.
在这样的背景下，健身游戏的不断发展，是否会对健身行业产生影响呢？事实上，健身游戏如果想要达到健身效果，动作标准至关重要。
In this context, fitness games continue to develop, whether the fitness industry will have an impact? In fact, fitness games, if you want to achieve fitness effect, action standards are crucial.
@灵魂健身杨老师在他的视频中以挤压健身环的动作举例，这个动作的目标是锻炼胸肌，但很多人在做这个动作的时候，由于发力姿势不准确，所以导致胸部还没有得到应有的锻炼，肩部就先酸了。
In his video, Ms. Yang uses the technique of squeezing a gym ring as an example. The goal of this exercise is to exercise the chest muscles, but many people do this because the posture is not accurate, so the chest has not been due to the exercise, the shoulder is sour.
图片来源：《健身环大冒险》预告片截图由此我们可以看到，想要借助游戏达到健身的目的，仍需要具备一定的经验和理论知识，而这恰恰是专业健身机构的优势。
Photo: The trailer for Fitness Ring Adventures shows that you still need some experience and theoretical knowledge in order to get fit, which is the advantage of a professional fitness organization.
此外，有媒体记者在体验游戏后对比自己在玩游戏时与在健身房运动时的心率发现：玩游戏期间心率稳步上升，但在健身房时心率则是快速上升，10分钟后就可达到出汗效果。
Media reporters compared their heart rates at games with those at the gym. Heart rates rose steadily during the game, but increased rapidly at the gym, leading to sweating in 10 minutes.
因此，健身游戏的功效是否能与专业健身相提并论，仍存在很多不确定性。
Therefore, whether the efficacy of fitness games and professional fitness can be compared, there is still a lot of uncertainty.
不过，对于有健身习惯的人群来说，在不能去健身房的日子，用游戏来保持每天的运动量或许会成为一种辅助健身的选择。
For people with fitness habits, however, playing games to maintain daily exercise may be an adjunctive exercise regimen on days when they can't get to the gym.
某健身群中，有网友表示会用《健身环大冒险》来坚持运动▼如此看来，至少在目前，健身游戏并不会对传统健身机构产生太大冲击，但或许二者在未来可以碰撞出一些出人意料的火花。
Why don't you stick it out for a while? Well, at least for now, fitness games aren't going to hurt traditional health organizations much, but maybe there'll be some unexpected sparks in the future.
