采访、撰文 | 吴楠投稿邮箱| gayspot_edit@163.com抵达武汉的第六天，晓阳就差一点暴露在新冠肺炎病毒的包围里。
At interview, article and # 124; Wu Nan's written mailbox & # 44; & # 45; gayspot _ edit @ 163.com's sixth day in Wuhan, nearly exposed to the New Crown Pneumonia virus.
晓阳是从北京前往武汉驰援的一名医护人员。
Xiaoyang is a medical worker who travels from Beijing to Wuhan.
作为一名急救专业的男护士，当他发现病区内一位病人血氧浓度迅速下降、呼吸明显憋闷时，他马上冲过去，为病人插管，这是把病人从死神手中短暂抢回来的最快速有效的方法，虽然这不是所有急救护士都掌握的技能。
As a male nurse specializing in first aid, he rushed to a patient with rapidly declining blood oxygen levels and suffocating breathing in the area. This was the quickest and most effective way to get a patient back from death, although it was not a skill all first aid nurses have mastered.
为了救人，晓阳的动作比较剧烈，防护服本就是完全密封的，以达到隔断病毒的目的。
In order to save people, xiaoyang action is more intense, protective clothing is completely sealed to achieve the goal of virus isolation.
但随着动作幅度的增大，防护服内的空气被挤压到背部，如同气球，猛地爆破了。
But as the range of movement increased, the air inside the suit was squeezed into the back, exploding like a balloon.
救治病人时，时间以秒论计。
The patient is treated in seconds.
晓阳完全不能去采取措施来保护自己。
Xiaoyang can't do anything to protect himself.
而且负责的病区内只有两名医护人员，两个人同时在施救。
There were only two paramedics in charge of the area, and two people were there to help.
病人状况稳定后，因为防护服很少，穿脱一次超过一个小时，加上如果一个医护人员离开病区，就要有别的同事来接替，无论物资还是人，都会造成损耗。
When the patient is in stable condition, because protective clothing is rarely worn out for more than an hour at a time, and if a medical worker leaves the area, someone else will replace him or her, both material and human.
晓阳示意同事用胶带在自己的背部粘了一下，以此撑到下班。
Xiaoyang signaled his co-workers to stick tape on their backs to stay out of work.
此时的晓阳除了因为长时间穿防护服、隔离衣、戴口罩、手套而产生的呼吸憋闷、手耳脸疼痛外，心里也有些害怕。
Xiaoyang at this time in addition to wearing protective clothing, protective clothing, wearing masks, gloves caused by suffocation, hand and ear pain, but also some fear.
晚上回到酒店，晓阳犹豫了一下，还是没有告诉远在千里之外的北京、正在高速路口执勤的男友林峰。
Back at the hotel in the evening, Xiaoyang hesitated for a moment, or told far away in Beijing, is on duty at the intersection of his boyfriend Lin Feng.
晓阳哭了一路从大年三十起，晓阳记不清自己第四次还是第五次向领导提出，要参加援鄂医疗队了。
Xiaoyang cried all the way from about 30, Xiaoyang can not remember his fourth or fifth time to the leadership, to participate in the medical team to Hubei.
正在这时，他所在的急诊科接诊了一位从武汉回来的病人。
Just then, his emergency department attended a patient who had returned from Wuhan.
照影显示，病人两侧肺都是白的，非常严重，需要气管插管。
Photographs showed that both sides of the patient's lungs were white, very serious, and needed trachea intubation.
气管插管对医务人员的威胁很大。
Trachea intubation poses a great threat to medical personnel.
在插管过程中，病人的口腔、咽喉、气管呈现较大的开放状态，虽然眼睛看不到病毒，但医护人员都知道，大量的病毒正随着病人的剧烈喘息和咳嗽喷薄而出。
During intubation, the patient's mouth, throat, and trachea are open, and although the eyes cannot see the virus, doctors and nurses know that a large number of viruses are erupting as the patient gasps and coughs.
当时医院的防护用品不够，但人不能不救，晓阳和同事们硬着头皮穿上主任积攒下的17年前SARS时期的防护服。
Hospitals didn't have enough protective equipment, but people couldn't help it. Xiao Yang and his colleagues braved the SARS-era suits that the director had accumulated 17 years ago.
没有N95口罩，就戴两个外科口罩，没有防护屏，就戴上护目镜。
No N95 mask, wear two surgical masks, no screen, put on goggles.
尽量在保护好自己的前提下，去做气管插管。
Try to protect yourself in the premise, to do trachea intubation.
三天后，病人的两次核酸检测结果都是阴性，按照当时的预警模式，参与急救的医护人员解除了隔离。
Three days later, the patient tested negative for both nucleic acids, and in accordance with the early warning model of the time, the paramedics involved in first aid were removed from isolation.
接下来三四天里的软磨硬泡，护理部主任终于从“不去武汉是为了保护你”改为了同意，但还是问了一句，“你可以不计报酬，但为什么不管生死？”晓阳回答，“保护病人是每一个医护人员的责任”。
Over the next three or four days, the head of the nursing department changed from "not to Wuhan to protect you" to "agree," but still asked, "You can disregard pay, but why not life or death?" Xiaoyang replied, "It is the responsibility of every healthcare worker to protect the patient."
主任的眼泪一下流了出来。
The director's tears welled up.
晓阳成为该院第二批出征中最年轻的医护人员之一。
Xiaoyang became one of the youngest medical workers in the hospital's second expedition.
初八凌晨2点，晓阳接到了短信，当天下午集结。
Early in the morning of 2 a.m., Xiaoyang received a text message, the same afternoon to gather.
而此时，他的男友林峰还没有结束每天至少七小时的执勤。
At this point, his boyfriend Lin Feng has not finished at least seven hours a day on duty.
林峰是一名刑警，因为疫情，现在也进入了每天执勤的工作模式。
Lin Feng is a criminal police officer, because of the epidemic, now also entered the daily operational mode.
早上林峰下班回到家，晓阳不得不说，“我要去武汉了”。
Lin Feng came home from work in the morning and Xiaoyang had to say, "I'm going to Wuhan."
性子急、脾气爆的林峰知道事情已经如此。
Lin Feng, quick-tempered and hot-tempered, knew this was already the case.
便立刻开始查天气预报，以估摸加上连日阴雨的南方的湿冷，“你爱过敏，又有哮喘……”林峰一边埋怨，一边拉着晓阳去超市买了电热毯。
Immediately began to check the weather forecast, to estimate plus days of wet and cold southern, "you love allergies, asthma..." Lin Feng complained, while pulling Xiaoyang to the supermarket to buy electric blanket.
出征仪式上，本来就爱哭的晓阳被生离死别的氛围弄得泪流不止。
During the war ceremony, Xiaoyang, who had loved to cry, was left in tears by the atmosphere of separation.
当看到同事们都被亲友、爱人包围着，而男友林峰站在人群的最后面，只能踮着脚、举着手机拍照，虽然只有十几米的距离，但对于同性恋人来说却宛如天堑。
When I saw my colleagues surrounded by friends and loved ones, my boyfriend Lin Feng stood at the back of the crowd, standing on tiptoe and holding a mobile phone to take photos.
在晓阳登上大巴前，林峰发了信息，“你的行李放在大巴车里了，我单位有事，先走了。
Before Xiaoyang boarded the bus, Lin Feng sent a message, "Your luggage has been put in the bus, I have business, first left.
”晓阳急忙扭头找林峰，他的车已经开到医院门口了。
"Xiaoyang hastily turned his head to find Lin Feng, whose car had arrived at the hospital gate.
第二条信息挤进了手机，“我眼窝浅，怕哭。
The second message into the mobile phone, "I have shallow eyes, afraid to cry.
”一直到晓阳抵达武汉的第二天，林峰才知道，晓阳哭了一路。
"It was not until the day after Xiaoyang arrived in Wuhan that Lin Feng learned that Xiaoyang had cried all the way.
留给家人的话2月1日16:37，晓阳抵达武汉天河机场。
Leave a message to the family February 1 16: 37, xiaoyang arrived in Wuhan Tianhe airport.
这个名列全国吞吐量第十四名、日运送旅客近四万人的机场里，除了援鄂医疗队和地勤人员外，空荡寂静。
The airport, which has the 14th largest throughput in the country and carries nearly 40,000 passengers a day, is empty and silent except for medical teams and ground personnel.
甚至在几天后下班，趁着回酒店休息前的半个多小时里，晓阳终于有机会登上长江大桥，他不顾自己因为恐高而冒的虚汗，站着看到了异常寂静的武汉城。
Even after work a few days later, and for more than half an hour before returning to his hotel to rest, Xiaoyang finally got a chance to climb the Yangtze River Bridge. Despite the sweat of his fear of heights, he stood and saw the very quiet city of Wuhan.
烟波浩渺的江水，此刻在两岸“武汉加油”“中国加油”的霓虹灯映衬下，竟变得舒缓安静。
The ethereal river water, now in the cross-strait "Wuhan refueling," "China refueling" neon lights, become calm and quiet.
因为在急诊室里每天遇到的都是危重或紧急的病人，晓阳之前就习惯了繁忙的工作状态。
Because every day in the emergency room are critical or urgent patients, xiao yang has been used to the busy working state.
并且男护士“身强力壮”，总是要干得更多一些。
And the male nurses are "strong" and always have to do more.
读完硕士的晓阳偏爱戴一顶带有卡通图案的护士帽，这成了他的一个标志。
Xiaoyang's preference for wearing a nurse's hat with a cartoon pattern became a hallmark of him after he finished his master's degree.
2月1日抵达武汉的当晚，这一批次的援鄂医疗队连夜分了组，按照病区和时间段，以四小时为一班，分成不同的班次和责任病区。
On the night of their arrival in Wuhan on February 1, the medical team from Hubei was divided into groups overnight, divided into four-hour shifts and areas of responsibility according to the disease area and time period.
每个病区每个班次的医护人数最少是两人。
The minimum number of medical personnel per shift in each ward is two.
晓阳在进入病区后，理解到两人的配置非常有必要，“穿着防护服在病区内是根本无法听清声音的，加上防护服不透气，又无法饮水，很容易晕倒。
After entering the area, Xiaoyang understood that the two were very necessary, "wearing protective clothing in the disease area can not hear clearly, coupled with the airtight clothing, drinking water, easy to faint.
这时就需要有人把你拖出去。
Someone needs to get you out of here.
”因为大部分援鄂医护人员不属于传染病专业，一直到夜里十点多，医疗队系统学习了整个防护方法和注意事项，在酒店一遍又一遍地练习，以确保第二天接手病区万无一失。
Since most medical professionals in Hubei do not specialize in infectious diseases, until more than 10: 00 in the night, the medical team systematically studied the whole protective method and precautions and practiced again and again in the hotel to ensure that the next day would be a safe place to take over the area.
而那也是援鄂医疗队近百人在一起的最后一晚。
That was the last night that nearly a hundred people from the medical team in Hubei were together.
从第二天起，除了同一班次的、相对固定的十几个人外，医护人员为避免彼此间的接触传染，进入酒店后都要进行单独隔离，“谁都不能保证在抢救过程中完全规避暴露风险。
From the second day onwards, apart from a dozen or so persons in the same shift, who were relatively fixed, to avoid contact with each other, medical staff were isolated upon entering the hotel. "There is no guarantee that the risk of exposure would be completely avoided during the rescue.
”晓阳负责的是危重症病区，而那和轻症病区的差异，从进入污染区之前就开始了。
Xiaoyang is in charge of the critically ill, and the difference between that and the mildly ill begins before it gets into the polluted area.
手套要戴5层。
Wear 5 layers of gloves.
晓阳得到的手套经常是小号的，戴上之后不到二十分钟会勒得手疼，再过半个小时就会麻木。
Xiaoyang glove is often small size, after wearing less than 20 minutes will be strangled hand pain, another half an hour will be numb.
戴上两层口罩后，呼吸都成了一种奢望，就像有一人捂着嘴似的。
After putting on two masks, breathing becomes a kind of extravagant hope, as if a person covered his mouth.
更不要说耳朵、鼻梁这些头部承重部位的挤压、破损，以及长时间奔走导致的脚踝被密封带磨破。
Not to mention the ear, nose girder these head load-bearing parts of the squeeze, damage, and long running caused by the ankle was worn out.
这对本来就有哮喘的晓阳来说，更增加了在病区内晕倒的概率。
This is already asthma for the Xiaoyang, but also increased the incidence of fainting in the disease area.
而且就算哮喘发作，因为口罩、隔离服、防护服的层层叠加，也是不能立刻通过呼吸给药的。
And even if asthma attacks, because masks, isolation clothing, protective clothing layer upon layer, also can not be given immediately through breathing.
“只能祈祷自己不出事。
"Just pray that nothing will happen to you.
”晓阳说，“我申请的时候就做好准备的，在我们所有医护人员的手机里，都准备了一些留给家人的话。
"When I applied, I was ready to leave a message for my family on all of our staff's cell phones," he said.
”加上很多病人处于病区内，不能使用手机、平板电脑等电子设备，情绪愈发压抑，有时会发泄到医护人员身上。
Coupled with the fact that many patients are in the sick zone, unable to use electronic devices such as cell phones and tablets, the mood is increasingly depressive, sometimes venting on health-care workers.
为了避免出事，晓阳和搭档制定了他们两人的求救动作：左手扶墙，右手举起。
To avoid an accident, Xiaoyang and his partner worked out a rescue plan for both of them: left-handed wall, right hand raised.
在进入病区的前一晚，晓阳强迫自己去学习使用纸尿裤。
On the night before entering the area, Xiaoyang forced himself to learn to use diapers.
这一批次医疗队用的四千多元纸尿裤是一位护士个人捐助的。
The batch of more than 4,000 diapers used by the medical team was donated by a nurse personally.
以前的工作经历里，就算是长时间手术，也不会连上厕所的时间都没有。
Previous work experience, even long hours of surgery, will not even have time to go to the toilet.
而现在想去卫生间，就要脱衣服，就要浪费一套防护设施。
Now to go to the bathroom, you have to take off your clothes, to waste a set of protective equipment.
“穿着纸尿裤是根本尿不出来的。
"I can't pee in diapers.
”在病区真的憋不住的时候，也很难顺利排尿，要找一个角落，集中注意力，一点一点往外挤，“如果一下子排出来，纸尿裤是不能迅速吸收的。
"It's hard to urinate when the area is really suffocating. Find a corner where you can concentrate and squeeze it out.
会流到裤子上。
It will flow to your pants.
”每天结束了四个小时的生死考验后，回到酒店，晓阳在南方冬春之交的寒意下，硬着头皮洗澡消毒。
After a four-hour ordeal each day, he returned to the hotel and bathed and disinfected himself in the cold of the south at the turn of winter and spring.
男友林峰在出发前给他买的电热毯显然已经不够了。
The electric blanket his boyfriend Lin Feng bought before he left was clearly not enough.
和林峰聊天时，晓阳无意中聊起自己在酒店被冻得够呛，没想到到武汉的第四天，晓阳就收到了林峰给他买的两个“小太阳”。
While chatting with Lin Feng, Xiaoyang unwittingly talked about being choked by the cold in the hotel, but on the fourth day in Wuhan, xiao yang received the two "little suns" that Lin Feng bought for him.
小太阳是林峰先在京东买来，再用顺丰快递到武汉的，这也是他能想到的最快速的方法。
The small sun is Lin Feng first bought in Jingdong, then Shunfeng express to Wuhan, this is also the fastest way he can think of.
“开开”“心心”2月14日，晓阳和林峰谁也没留意到日期，那一天是情人节。
On February 14, neither Xiaoyang nor Lin Feng noticed the date. It was Valentine's Day.
晓阳一如平时，要在病区忙碌四个小时，林峰则到凌晨才结束工作。
Xiaoyang, as usual, to be busy in the sick area for four hours, Lin Feng until the end of the morning work.
那天，林峰在高速口执勤，天下了大雪，他整个人成了雪人。
That day, Lin Feng was on duty at the top of the highway. It snowed heavily and he became a snowman.
晓阳跟林峰说了句，“降温了要穿厚衣服”，就进污染区工作了。
Xiaoyang and Lin Feng said, "to cool down to wear thick clothes," on the work into the contaminated areas.
等晓阳出来，好不容易打开手机，看到林峰很早之前回的讯息：“你守护患者，我在背后守护你。
Waixiaoyang came out, hard to open the phone, see Lin Feng a long time ago back message: "You guard the patient, I guard you behind.
”晓阳心里不是滋味。
Xiaoyang was not feeling well.
分别上了“前线”的两人一个在武汉一个在北京忙碌着，交流只能靠视频聊天。
On the "front line" of two people in Wuhan a busy Beijing, communication can only rely on video chat.
由于工作时间不一致，就算互相约好时间，也会因为突发情况而空等一场。
Because the working time is not consistent, even if mutual appointment good time, also because of the unexpected situation and wait.
两人为避免对方担心，好不容易才能成行的一次视频聊天里，不约而同地挑了轻松的话题。
Two people to avoid each other worried, hard to make a trip to a video chat, coincidentally selected a light topic.
八年的恋人关系让两人少了很多别的恋人能够轻松实现的“平常感”。
An eight-year relationship deprives two people of the "normal feeling" that other couples can easily achieve.
晓阳到武汉后，林峰打电话说，他们单位所有同事在医院工作的爱人都放假回家了，一方面可能是怕交叉感染，另一方面看到医务人员会很辛苦，也请他们平衡一下家里。
When Xiaoyang arrived in Wuhan, Mr. Lin called and said that all his colleagues at the hospital had gone home on vacation. On the one hand, they might be afraid of cross-infection.
林峰半开玩笑地说他很亏，如果两人是异性恋的话，他也能放假了。
Lin Feng half jokingly said he was at a disadvantage, if the two were heterosexual, he could also have a holiday.
虽然林峰是开玩笑，但一向能言的晓阳猛地安静了下来。
Although Lin Feng is joking, but always can say Xiaoyang suddenly quiet down.
他感到内心强烈的失落。
He felt a strong sense of loss.
在一起的八年，晓阳记不清有多少次，他凌晨一两点被医院叫醒去接紧急任务，每次都是林峰一边打着哈欠一边爬起来送他去医院。
For eight years, Xiaoyang couldn't remember how many times he was woken up by the hospital at 1 or 2 in the morning to pick up urgent tasks.
也记不清有多少次林峰不在身边，深感孤单的他不得不养了两条猫陪伴，这两只猫分别叫做“开开”“心心”。
Can not remember how many times Lin Feng is not around, feel lonely he had to keep two cats, the two cats are called "open" "heart."
两只猫成了两人口中的一对“儿女”。
Two cats make a pair of two people.
最近的聊天里，林峰说晓阳胖了，“你就跟你儿子一样，都开始长腮了。
In a recent chat, Lin Feng said Xiaoyang was fat. "You're just like your son, starting to get jawed."
”晓阳笑了，“我是压力胖。
"Xiaoyang smiled." I am stressed out.
”心里随之泛起一点甜。
A little sweetness rose in his heart.
可在意自己身材的晓阳，听到林峰这样说，每天晚上又都会少吃。
Can care about their body Xiaoyang, heard Lin Feng said that every night will be less to eat.
接你们回家生活里的一点甜，会让吃过苦的人，感受得更加真切。
Take you home a little sweet life, will let the people who eat bitter, feel more real.
三年前，晓阳的父母得知自己的儿子和林峰在一起，私下里找了林峰几次。
Three years ago, Xiaoyang's parents learned that their son and Lin Feng together, in private found Lin Feng several times.
后来晓阳的母亲警告他“不要再继续这样胡闹下去了”，林峰却从来没有告诉过晓阳被他的父母逼问的经历。
Later, Xiaoyang's mother warned him "don't continue this nonsense," but Lin Feng has never told Xiaoyang his parents forced him to ask the experience.
“可能是担心增加我的压力”，两个人加两只猫的生活在彼此的坚持中默默前行。
"It could be fear of increasing my stress," two people and two cats living in silence on each other's insistence.
而这一次，林峰从大年三十那天起就开始连续执勤。
But this time, Lin Feng has been on duty continuously since New Year's Eve.
每天至少七个小时，从高速公路口到社区、街道，甚至是人员排查……那几天晓阳从医院下班，哪怕再困，也要等林峰到家，帮着他消毒、洗衣服，嘴却硬着，“我这是怕他在外面带病毒回来”。
At least seven hours a day, from the entrance of the expressway to the community, the streets and even the personnel check-up... Xiaoyang days from the hospital, even if sleepy, to wait for Lin Feng to come home, to help him disinfect, wash clothes, mouth hard, "I am afraid he will bring the virus back outside.
或许是彼此都太了解对方的性格，林峰很少和晓阳讲自己的苦和累。
Perhaps each other is too familiar with each other's character, Lin Feng and Xiaoyang rarely talk about their own hardships and fatigue.
晓阳多次报名终于争取到奔赴武汉抗疫前线的机会时，也没有和林峰事先商量，“从私下角度想，他肯定是不希望我来的。
Xiaoyang has repeatedly signed up to win the opportunity to fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, and did not consult beforehand, "from a private point of view, he certainly do not want me.
”一直到晓阳到了武汉，两人视频聊天时，林峰才说，从大方向上看，他是支持晓阳来的，但是关起门来回到自己的小家，谁也不愿意把自己的另一半往火坑里推。
"Only when Xiaoyang arrived in Wuhan did Lin Feng say he was supportive of Xiaoyang in general, but he went home behind closed doors and no one wanted to push his other half into the fiery pit.
晓阳当了一辈子医生的父亲为儿子的举动感到自豪，但却牵肠挂肚地叮嘱：“千万做好防护，进病房时一定互相检查一下防护措施是否到位，对病人要耐心细致，要做好战胜各种困难的思想准备。
The father of a doctor for the rest of his life was proud of his son's actions, but he was anxious to make sure that every precaution was taken, that every precaution was taken when entering the ward, that patients should be patient and careful, and that they should be prepared to overcome any difficulties
”而晓阳抵达武汉后，每天也都会给父母报个平安。
"And Xiaoyang arrived in Wuhan, every day will also give parents a message of peace.
2003年SARS时，晓阳的父亲就在第一线的呼吸科。
When SARS broke out in 2003, Xiaoyang's father was on the front line of respiration.
当时的防护物资没有现在这样齐全，没有N95，没有防护服。
The protective equipment was not as complete as it is now, without N95 and without protective clothing.
在抢救室为一个病人做气管插管的时候，一屋子的医务人员都有可能倒下。
While doing a trachea intubation for a patient in a recovery room, a room full of paramedics could fall.
晓阳记得，当时父亲每次戴四十层纱布口罩和游泳镜。
Xiaoyang remembers that his father wore forty layers of gauze masks and swimming glasses every time.
因为天气太热，病房里没有空调，只能将老式推拉窗两边各开到最大透透气。
Because it was too hot, there was no air conditioning in the ward, so the old push-and-pull windows had to be opened to maximum ventilation on each side.
口罩不够用，晓阳已经退休的奶奶姥姥买来纱布，在家夜以继日地缝口罩，“每天一睡醒就开始缝口罩”，那是当时给父亲也是给医护人员在病魔面前唯一的生命保障。
Xiaoyang has retired grandmother bought gauze, sewing masks at home day and night, "every waking moment began to sew masks," which was the only life guarantee for the father and the medical staff in the face of illness.
年事已高的奶奶甚至因此得了滑膜炎。
The elderly grandmother even got synovitis as a result.
17年后的今天，换晓阳去和新冠肺炎搏斗了。
Today, 17 years later, Changxiaoyang went to fight with the new crown pneumonia.
当他把这些讲给林峰听的时候，虽然父母还不能接受两人之间的关系，可是父母冲在前线的经历，悄无声息地激励着两个年轻的男人。
When he told Lin Feng these things, although the parents can not accept the relationship between the two, but the parents rushed in front of the front, quietly inspiring two young men.
尽管如此，每天从酒店到医院将近一个小时的车程里，晓阳还是会因为担心和压力，而常常感到心里不是滋味。
Nevertheless, every day from the hotel to the hospital nearly an hour's drive, xiao yang will still worry and pressure, often feel uncomfortable.
2月25日，两人视频聊天时，晓阳有些歉意地对林峰说，“本来计划来一周的，现在已经三周了，估计暂时还回不去。
On February 25, two people video chat, xiao yang apologetically said to Lin Feng, "originally planned to come a week, now three weeks, estimated temporarily unable to return.
”林峰跳下椅子，跑过去把猫咪“心心”抱给晓阳看。
Lin Feng jumped out of his chair and ran to show Xiaoyang the cat's heart.
在重症病房里干脆利落的晓阳忍不住又红了眼圈，林峰在镜头另一端强忍着眼泪，“心心，你看爸爸又胖了！”晓阳没有告诉林峰，下午在病区，因为地面湿滑，自己不小心滑倒，脚踝肿了鸡蛋大的一个包。
In the intensive care unit dry Xiaoyang can not help but red-eyed circle, Lin Feng in the lens of the other end of the strong bear tears, "Heart, you see daddy fat!" Xiaoyang did not tell Lin Feng, afternoon in the sick area, because the ground slippery, accidentally slipped, ankle swollen egg-sized bag.
视频结束，已经快十点了。
The video is over. It's almost ten o'clock.
忍着脚痛的晓阳打开随身携带的两台笔记本电脑，开始做他担任导师的大学课程的课件，同时进行网课形式的试讲，“还有两周就要上课了，我打算结合这一次的疫情一线实际，增加一些急救方法。
"With two laptop computers in his possession and courseware for his tutor's college course, as well as an online tutorial," I plan to add some first aid in the light of the actual outbreak in the next two weeks
也是一次经验积累和提升。
It is also an experience accumulation and upgrading.
”而且回到北京，估计也没时间修整，“现在我们医院也是满负荷运转，估计回去之后也要马上投入工作，现在有时间就多弄一些课件。
"And back in Beijing, I don't think we have time to fix it," he said. "Now our hospital is running at full capacity and is expected to start working immediately after returning, and now we have time to get more courseware.
”忙到凌晨，晓阳临睡前，耳畔又想起那天自己乘坐的前往武汉驰援的飞机上，机长的广播，“本次航班从北京飞往北京，经停武汉……等你们赢了，我们来接你们回家。
"Busy until dawn, xiao yang went to bed, ear next to the day of his flight to Wuhan, the captain of the broadcast," this flight from Beijing to Beijing, stopped Wuhan... until you win, we will pick you up home.
