平时那一撮歧视亚洲人的人，还掩饰着没暴露，现在狐狸尾巴露出来了。
The usual group of people who discriminate against Asians, hiding behind a veil, has come to the fore.
记　者 | 陈　冰受访者 | 高彦隽我是谁？我在做什么？作为一名美国注册心理咨询师，远在大洋彼岸的美国新泽西州发展的我，看到武汉一线医护人员与疫情顽强抗争的种种事迹，对医护人员的敬意无法用言语表达。
Who am I? What am I doing? As an American registered psychologist developed in New Jersey, far beyond the Pacific, I cannot express my respect for the medical personnel who fought so tenaciously against the epidemic.
一线的艰苦，只有一线知道。
The first line of hardship, only a line to know.
当然，他们中一定有感到害怕、委屈、焦虑、绝望、疲惫……出现睡不着、吃不下饭、脾气不好的行为，哪怕是崩溃失控，都是在这个非常时期对抗突如其来、过于集中甚至极限挑战的高压力源的正常的应激反应。
Of course, there must be fears, grievances, anxieties, hopelessness, fatigue... sleepless nights, sleepless meals, bad-tempered behavior, or even a breakdown out of control, are normal stressors that come at a time of sudden, concentrated, and even extreme challenges.
作为旁观者，我们能做的，就是聆听他们的经历、付出、为难……理解他们的委屈、愤怒、恐惧……接纳他们的疲惫、脆弱、无力……在这个基础上，与他们站在一起。
All we can do as bystanders is to listen to their experiences, to give, to be difficult... to understand their grievances, their anger, their fears... to accept their fatigue, their vulnerability, their powerlessness... to stand with them on this basis.
我们是一支由世界各地的志愿者组成的专业心理咨询公益团队，为武汉的医护、病患乃至普通人提供24小时不间断心理热线服务，迄今为止，已经运作了接近2个月时间，接下来将会向中国在欧美的留学生、华侨、华人等群体提供相关帮助。
We are a pro-bono team of volunteers from all over the world who provide 24-hour psychological hotlines for medical care, patients and even ordinary people in Wuhan. So far, we have been operating for nearly two months and will provide relevant assistance to Chinese students, overseas Chinese and Chinese in Europe and the United States.
我们在疫情期间，用“心”抗“疫”。
We used the heart to fight against the plague during the outbreak.
缘起1月23日，武汉封城。
As a result of January 23, Wuhan Seal.
北京教育学院的曹慧博士马上想到发起一个心理援助热线，帮助身处高压环境中的武汉医护人员，这个想法迅速得到武汉华中科技大学附属同济医院徐波医生的点赞。
Dr. Cao Hui of the Beijing Institute of Education immediately thought of launching a psychological help line to help Wuhan medical workers in a high-pressure environment, an idea that was quickly praised by Xu Bo, an associate of Wuhan Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
于是专家们迅速行动起来，1月27日就建立起了微信群，包括中国第一批临床心理学注册督导师王建平、国际应用心理学会咨询心理学专业委员会理事侯志瑾、国际华人心理与援助专业协会主席张怀宇在内的资深心理督导师成立了一个20人的督导团队，负责视频面试来自世界各地的专业心理咨询师或精神科医生志愿者，以及开展相关的培训工作。
So experts moved quickly to build a microcosm on Jan. 27, including Wang Jianping, China's first registered supervisor in clinical psychology; Hou ZhiJin, a member of the Advisory Psychology Committee of the International Association of Applied Psychology; and Zhang Huaiyu, President of the International Association of Chinese Psychology and Aid Professionals.
我第一时间加入了这个群，申请成为志愿者。
I first joined the group and applied to become a volunteer.
在还没有开通热线之前，我们先建立起了运营支持团队，包括统筹、技术、宣传、法务、外联、咨询师和督导师服务组等。
Before setting up the hotline, we have set up an operation support team including co-ordination, technical, publicity, legal affairs, outreach, consultant and supervisor services, etc.
我加入的是翻译小组，我们这个危机干预资料翻译小群有二十几个人，国内国外的都有，大家每天根据自己的时间安排认领一部分需要翻译的相关医学资料，一个翻译加一个校对，一晚上可以翻译两三个章节。
I join the translation team, our crisis intervention group of more than 20 people, both at home and abroad, each day according to their own schedule to claim some of the relevant medical materials need to be translated, a translator plus a proofreading, one night can translate two or three chapters.
这些资料既包括我们这些志愿者需要遵从的法律伦理准则，也包括一些专业的心理危机干预资料。
This information includes both the code of legal ethics that we volunteers are expected to follow, as well as information on professional psychological crisis interventions.
比如说，根据疫期特性和热线及危机干预特点，我们翻译了不少编适合的工作人员手册和自助手册。
For example, we have translated a number of suitable staff and self-help manuals based on epidemic characteristics and hotline and crisis intervention characteristics.
作为一名志愿者，我填写了报名表，包括基本信息、学历、职业训练经历、工作单位、伦理学习等信息及证明材料。
As a volunteer, I filled out the application form, including basic information, academic qualifications, vocational training experience, work unit, ethical learning and other information and supporting materials.
还做了测试题。
The test questions were also done.
对我们这些志愿者的资历筛查包括：美国执业执照、国内注册系统认证等职业资格；咨询时长200小时以上，督导时长50小时以上，危机干预时长50小时以上；参加过且提供关于伦理培训的学习经历证明……后来我接到了督导组专家的视频面试通知。
Qualification screening for these volunteers included: United States licenses to practice, certification in the domestic registration system; over 200 hours of counselling, more than 50 hours of supervision and more than 50 hours of crisis intervention; and participation in and provision of evidence of learning about ethics training.
专家们一上来就扮演患者，看我如何进行危机处理。
The experts came in to play the patient and see how I handled the crisis.
很快，面试的三个专家通过了我的考核，据说督导组独立审查后合议，二位督导或顾问专家一致认可的咨询师才能入选，最终入选比例为10:1。
Soon, the three experts interviewed passed my assessment. It was said that after independent review by the supervisory group, only the consultants agreed upon by the two supervisors or consultants could be selected, and the final selection ratio was 10: 1.
我们这些入选的志愿者都拥有专业心理咨询师或精神科医生执业资质，拥有丰富的专业创伤治疗、危机干预、心理急救培训和心理援助热线实践经验，还有一部分人曾经参与过汶川地震等重大灾后心理重建任务。
These selected volunteers have professional counselors or psychiatrists with extensive professional trauma treatment, crisis intervention, psychological first aid training and psychological assistance hotline practical experience, and some have participated in major post-earthquake psychological reconstruction tasks such as the Wenchuan earthquake.
但我们还是纷纷进入到了岗前培训的环节。
But we still have to enter the pre-service training link.
这些督导们给我们上了不同类型的督导课，为我们下一步援助热线储备知识与能力构建。
These supervisors have given us different types of supervision classes to help us build up our knowledge and capacity for the next step.
毕竟热线救助和心理咨询是两回事。
After all, hot-line help and counseling are two different things.
心理咨询是一个很缓慢的过程，它的最终目的是要把咨询者心中最痛的点打开。
Psychological counseling is a very slow process, its ultimate goal is to open the most painful point in the minds of the counselors.
而热线救助则相当于外科的紧急处理措施，需要赶紧包扎止血，不至于让咨询者的情绪失控，做出自杀等不理智的举动。
And hot-line rescue is equivalent to surgical emergency measures, need to quickly bandage stop bleeding, not let the feelings of consultants out of control, suicidal and other irrational behavior.
所以，我们不能马上把人家最痛的点打开，而是要在半个小时左右的热线电话时间内采用尽可能的舒缓方法，让咨询者的情绪平缓下来。
So instead of opening someone's worst pain right away, we need to use the soothing method possible during half an hour or so to calm a counselor's mood.
因为群里差不多有一半的志愿者身在北美，所以我们和国内的志愿者正好在时间上互补，达成了热线24小时开通的目标。
Since nearly half of the volunteers in the group are in North America, we complement each other in time to reach our goal of a 24-hour hotline.
大家根据自己的时间排好班次，用手机接听来自大洋彼岸的倾诉电话。
We arrange our shift according to our own time and answer the phone calls from across the ocean.
也就是在武汉封城后的几天时间之内，我们就快速建立起了一支以守护医护人员心理健康为己任的24小时不间断热线。
Within a few days after Wuhan closed the city, we quickly set up a 24-hour hotline dedicated to the mental health of health care workers.
我们的志愿者团队中有来自湖北省武汉市一线医院的医务人员、来自全国的具有心理学背景的社工、管理人员以及多个领域的专业人士，从全方位的角度关注疫情的实时信息，并不断根据一线医务人员的情况和需求改进我们的工作。
Our volunteer team includes medical personnel from Wuhan First-Line Hospital in Hubei Province, social workers with psychological backgrounds from all over the country, managers and professionals in various fields to follow up the epidemic from all angles and constantly improve our work according to the situation and needs of front-line medical personnel.
心理“树洞”我们都做了些什么？首先，当然是24小时不间断的专业心理咨询师守候，为医护人员开通心理防线的守护。
Psychological "tree hole" what we have done? First of all, of course, 24-hour professional psychological counseling waiting for the opening of a psychological defense line for health-care personnel.
其次，我们在“用心抗疫”这个公众号发布一系列的心理援助文章，进行在线科普宣教。
Secondly, we published a series of psychological aid articles for online popularization of science in the public "Heart Against Plague."
同时，还专门针对医护人员及相关机构的心理健康问题形成了一本《关爱疫情一线医护人员心理手册》。
At the same time, a psychological manual for frontline health-care workers has been developed specifically to address the mental health problems of health-care personnel and related institutions.
不仅仅是医护人员，任何有需要的人，都可以在公众号中留言，从而获得心理咨询师的陪伴和帮助。
Not only the medical staff, anyone in need can leave a message in the public phone number, thus get the companionship and help of a counselor.
我们还专门开发了一个“用心心理”的微信小程序，有需要的人可以用文字求助。
We have also developed a special "mind mind" micro-letter program, people who need text help.
我们还会通过视频会议系统对医护人员及相关机构开展心理援助、哀伤辅导等，并实时回答医护人员提问。
We will also conduct psychological assistance, grief counselling, etc. for medical staff and related organisations through the videoconference system, and answer medical staff questions in real time.
通过培训和咨询，我发现医护绝对是高危人群。
Through training and counseling, I found that health care is definitely a high-risk group.
通常，我们将拥有心理创伤病史、心理疾病史、家族史、孤立无援，而且处于高强度工作之中、带伤工作、带伤比赛的人群视为高危人群，对照以上几点，可以看出处于一线的医护人员工作压力和心理压力都是非常巨大的。
As a rule, we have a history of trauma, a history of mental illness, a family history, a history of isolation, and people who are in high-intensity jobs, work with injuries and games with injuries are considered at high risk.
在抗“疫”初期，他们不得不面对连轴转，甚至更长时间的工作排班。
In the early days of fighting the plague, they had to face a shift in work schedules, even longer.
在医疗物资不足的情况下，不得不冒着被感染的风险“裸奔”。
In the case of insufficient medical supplies, had to take the risk of infection "run naked."
而他们可能无法关心和帮助自己的家人。
And they may not be able to care for and help their families.
可以说在个人、家庭和职业上都遇到了非常大的挑战。
It can be said that the personal, family and professional encountered very big challenges.
现在，他们则面临着职业耗竭感。
Now, they face a sense of professional exhaustion.
他们的同事可能被感染，病人可能无法成功救治，而家人可能已经离去……这些悲伤的事实都会成为他们心理的负担，淤积在心中久久不能散去。
Their colleagues may be infected, their patients may not be treated successfully, and their families may have left... these sad facts can become a psychological burden that will remain with them for a long time to come.
我们能做的，就是帮助他们快速找回自己应对不良情绪的方法，让情绪慢慢平复下来。
What we can do is help them quickly find their way back to coping with their bad emotions and gradually calm them down.
曾经有位武汉金银潭的科室主任说，科室4个医生24小时连轴转，抢救、查房、陪病人送检，除此之外，病人的吃喝、大小便，也都得帮助护士做，因为怕病人在厕所晕倒。
Once there was a director of the section in Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool said that the four doctors in the department worked 24 hours in a row to rescue, check the room and accompany the patient to the doctor for examination.
有的医生刚刚脱下工作服便再也忍不住，瞬间变身小女生，坐在房间里嚎啕大哭；也有不知如何宣泄情绪的医生，表面上看一切正常，却因为长时间不能休息、无法轮换，出现应激性障碍，严重失眠导致无法正常上班……真的，听到他们的哭声，远在美国的我，都能感到深深的撕裂感。
Some doctors just took off their work clothes, can no longer help but suddenly become girls, sitting in the room crying, and do not know how to vent their emotions, seemingly normal, but due to long-term inability to rest, unable to rotate, stress disorder, severe insomnia caused by normal work... really, heard their cry, far away in the United States, I can feel deeply torn.
不过，我算是很幸运的，能够在这个时候，以自己的专业身份帮助他们，让自己觉得心安一点。
However, I was lucky enough to be able to help them in their professional capacity at this time and to feel more at ease.
某种程度上讲，这也是对我的一次很好的治疗。
In a way, it was a good treatment for me.
因为督导老师们会根据我们的案例，再建群进行分享。
Because the supervisors will be based on our case, and then set up a group to share.
比方说如何在帮助求助者的同时不过多地自我卷入，及时地进行自我觉察，并在自我觉察后进行自我调整、自我关怀，稳定地陪伴、支持自己。
For example, how to help the sufferer without becoming too self-involved, timely self-awareness, self-adjustment, self-care, stable companionship, and support after self-awareness.
反转没有想到，两个月以后，同样的危机再一次复制。
Unexpectedly, two months later, the same crisis was repeated.
我们在泽西市，距离曼哈顿也就十分钟车程。
We're in Jersey, ten minutes' drive from Manhattan.
现在的情况是政府关闭所有学前班、幼儿园至十二年级学校、高等教育机构。
The situation is such that the Government has closed all pre-school, kindergarten to grade 12 and higher education institutions.
关闭所有赌场、赛马场、剧院、体育馆。
Close all casinos, racetracks, theatres, stadiums.
晚上8点以后关闭所有非必要的零售、休憩和娱乐业务。
Close all non-essential retail, leisure and entertainment activities after 8 pm.
禁止超过50人的聚集活动。
Gathering of more than 50 persons is prohibited.
同时敦请大家尽量呆在家里，如果外出，请大家保持距离。
At the same time urged everyone to stay at home, if out, please keep a distance.
早上超市营业的第一个小时，买菜时间留给老人、残疾人和孕妇，保证他们买到东西是其一，提供单纯的环境，减少概率感染更为重要。
In the first hour of the morning, shopping time is reserved for the elderly, the disabled and pregnant women, making sure they have something to buy.
我们基本不出门了，但是在外面散步的人也不是没有，这两天天气好，还是有人出门看看的。
We hardly went out, but the strollers were none the less; the weather had been fine for the last two days, and some one had gone out to see it.
我最近不接热线电话了，现在孩子不上学，没有时间了。
I recently stopped answering the telephone hotline and now the children are out of school and out of time.
高彦隽接听热线电话的工作不得不暂停，因为年幼的孩子不上学了，需要人照顾现在我们这边的各家医院口罩、防护服也不够，现在在各种群拉捐赠。
Gao's work on the hotline has had to be suspended because young children no longer go to school and need to be cared for.
美国股市熔断了那么多次，经济压力越来越大了。
The US stock market has melted down so many times and the economy is under increasing pressure.
有些人如钟点工阿姨，工资变少、一定压力很大。
Some people, such as auntie part-time, pay less, must be very stressed.
坐办公室的也会担心，经济不好，会不会裁员。
People in offices worry, too, about the economy and whether they'll lay off workers.
单身在家的，会很孤独。
If you're single at home, it's lonely.
我觉得现在的美国和当时的武汉初期很像。
I think the United States is very similar to the early days of Wuhan.
这个疫情来势凶猛，对各国领导力都是一种挑战。
The epidemic has come at a devastating pace and is a challenge to national leadership.
物资终究应该是政府调度、补充准备的责任，而不是靠民间捐助。
After all, supplies should be the responsibility of the government, supplementary preparation, rather than relying on private donations.
美国吃瓜两个月，看我们这期间物资还如此匮乏，没有准备充分，领导力让人失望！3月19日，美国总统特朗普在白宫新闻发布会上的讲稿被记者拍下。
US President Donald Trump's speech at a White House news conference on March 19 was filmed as the United States ate melons for two months to see how scarce, ill-prepared and unprepared we were.
照片显示，稿件中的“新冠病毒”被划掉，手写改为了“中国病毒”现在美国还有歧视亚洲人的部分现象，这是一直存在的，现在更加明目张胆了。
Pictures of the New Crown Virus scratched off the manuscript to read "Chinese Virus" and now part of the discrimination against Asians still exists in the US, and is now even more blatant.
平时那一撮歧视亚洲人的人，还掩饰着没暴露，现在狐狸尾巴露出来了。
The usual group of people who discriminate against Asians, hiding behind a veil, has come to the fore.
虽然大多数是友善的，但这种歧视，遇到一百个人，或许就一个人发神经病，也非常糟心，让人不爽。
Although most of them are friendly, this kind of discrimination, meeting a hundred people, and perhaps just one person, is very bad and unpleasant.
而特朗普多次公然将新冠病毒称为“中国病毒”，这更让人气愤！我看美国的心理咨询措施必须要赶紧跟上了。
Trump's repeated public calls of the new crown virus, the "Chinese virus," are all the more outrageous.
