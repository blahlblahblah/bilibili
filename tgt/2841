另据韩联社4日报道，韩国政府当天已为抗击疫情编制了11.7万亿韩元（约合人民币684.3亿元）规模的补充预算，该补充预算案将于5日提交国会。
South Korea's government has drawn up a supplementary budget of 11.7 trillion won (68.43 billion yuan) to combat the outbreak, which will be presented to parliament on May 5, it was reported Thursday.
除加强防疫体系外，政府还将投入巨额资金刺激受疫情冲击的内需市场。
In addition to strengthening the epidemic prevention system, the government will invest a huge amount of money to stimulate the domestic market hit by the epidemic.
这是文在寅政府成立以来第四次制定补充预算案，也是七年来规模最大的一次，超过2015年中东呼吸综合征（MERS）疫情蔓延时制定的预算案规模。
It was the fourth supplementary budget since the establishment of the government and the largest in seven years, exceeding the size of the budget set in 2015, when the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic spread.
在这11.7万亿韩元的补充预算中，有8.5万亿将用于各项抗疫项目，包括完善和升级防疫体系（2.3万亿）、支援受疫情冲击的中小企业和小工商业者（2.4万亿）、搞活萧条的地方经济（8000亿）、稳定民生与就业（3万亿），其余3.2万亿则将用于填补税收缺口。
Of the 11.7 trillion won supplementary budget, 8.5 trillion won will go to anti-epidemic projects, including improving and upgrading epidemic prevention systems (2.3 trillion won), supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and small businesses hit by the epidemic (2.4 trillion), invigorating depressed local economies (800 billion), stabilizing livelihoods and employment (3 trillion), and covering the remaining 3.2 trillion.
另针对疫情较严重的大邱和庆北地区，将特别拨款6000亿韩元用于稳定就业。
In addition, 600 billion won will be earmarked for stable employment in Daegu and Gyeongbei regions, where the epidemic is more serious.
若加上正在执行的4万亿韩元和二期16万亿韩元的拨款，韩国政府为抗击疫情投入的资金总计将超过30万亿韩元（约合人民币1754.7亿元）。
Adding the 4 trillion won and 16 trillion won currently being implemented, the South Korean government will spend more than 30 trillion won (175.47 billion yuan) to fight the epidemic.
韩国副总理兼企划财政部长官洪楠基表示，政府认为支持减损复苏经济是当务之急，将积极推动补充预算案获得通过，并在通过后的2个月内执行75%以上的预算。
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and Finance Hong Nan-ki said the government considers it a top priority to support the erosion of the recovery and will push for the adoption of the supplementary budget and the implementation of more than 75% of the budget within two months of its adoption.
洪楠基前一日还表示，政府将向弱势群体免费发放1.3亿只口罩，并将推出多项举措解决疫情下口罩难买问题。
The previous day, Hongnaki said the government would distribute 130 million face masks to vulnerable groups free of charge and would launch a number of initiatives to address the difficulty of buying masks in the face of the epidemic.
他说，将力争把全国口罩的日产量增至1400万只，并将大幅提升通过公共流通网的供给比率（目前为50%），每只售价控制在1200至1500韩元（约合人民币7至9元）。
He said he would aim to increase production to 14 million masks a day and would dramatically increase the supply ratio through the public distribution network, which currently stands at 50 percent, with each unit priced at 1,200 to 1,500 won (about 7 to 9 yuan).
洪楠基表示，各大药房本周内将全面启动监管系统，防止重复购买口罩的行为；政府将为口罩厂商提供增产补助、保障原料供应等各项支援；还将考虑从巴西、南非等地区进口口罩。
Hong Nan said pharmacies would launch a full-scale monitoring system this week to prevent repeat mask purchases, that the government would provide assistance to mask makers to increase production and secure supplies of raw materials, and that it would consider importing masks from Brazil and South Africa.
但他也表示，目前而言，韩国口罩仍是质量最好的产品，上述国家的产品均达不到国内KF80级标准，因此不能完全依靠进口。
But he said the mask is still the best-quality product at the moment, and that none of the products in those countries meet the KF80 standard and therefore cannot rely entirely on imports.
