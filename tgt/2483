””关于“新冠病毒潜伏期最长24天”的话题，钟南山团队在最新公布的论文中指出，单纯根据最小、最大值评估人群的潜伏期容易引起误读。
On the topic of "Up to 24 days incubation period for new crown viruses," Zhong Nan-shan's team points out in a new paper that estimating latency periods based solely on minimum and maximum values is prone to misreading.
当地时间2020年2月28日，由国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山领衔的“中国2019新型冠状病毒疾病的临床特征”研究论文在顶级医学期刊《新英格兰医学杂志》（NEJM）上在线公开发表。
On February 28, 2020, the research paper "Clinical Features of the New Coronavirus Disease in China 2019," led by Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the high-level panel of experts, was published online in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the top medical journal.
该研究纳入了来自2019年12月11日至2020年1月29日来自全国31个省（市）共552家医院的1099例确诊新冠肺炎患者。
The study included 1,099 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia from 11 December 2019 to 29 January 2020 in 552 hospitals in 31 provinces (municipalities) across the country.
该项研究显示，在1099例患者中，926例为非重症，173例为重症。
The study showed that of 1,099 patients, 926 were non-severe and 173 were severe.
重症患者的年龄比非重症患者大7岁（中位数）。
Patients with severe illness are 7 years older (median) than those who are not.
此外，重症患者有合并症的情况（38.7%）比非重症患者（21.0%）常见。
In addition, complications were more common in severe cases (38.7 per cent) than in non-severe cases (21.0 per cent).
不过，重症患者和非重症患者的暴露史相似。
However, the history of exposure was similar for severe and non-severe patients.
值得注意的是，研究显示，入院时43.8%的患者有发热，但住院期间88.7%有发热。
It is noteworthy that the study showed that 43.8 per cent of the patients admitted had fever, but 88.7 per cent had fever during hospitalization.
不发热的新冠肺炎患者比例高于SARS-CoV（1%）和MERS-CoV（2%）感染患者，因此如果监测病例的定义侧重于检测发热，则不发热的患者可能会被漏诊。
The proportion of patients with non-febrile pneumonia is higher than that of patients with SARS-CoV (1 per cent) and MERS-CoV (2 per cent), so if the definition of surveillance cases focuses on detection of fever, non-febrile patients may be missed.
相对于SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV，新冠病毒的致死率较低。
Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the mortality of new crown virus was lower.
研究团队在这项研究中确定的病死率为1.4%，低于近期其他团队报道的病死率。
The team identified a 1.4 percent fatality rate in the study, lower than the rate reported by other recent teams.
他们认为，原因很可能是样本量和病例纳入标准的差异。
The reason, they argue, may well be the difference between sample sizes and the inclusion of cases.
他们同时认为，由于轻症患者和未就医患者并未纳入本研究，因此真实的病死率可能更低。
They also believe that the true fatality rate is likely to be even lower, since light patients and those who are not treated are not included in the study.
研究团队还强调，尽管新冠病毒和SARS-CoV具有种属相似性，但一些临床特征可以将新冠肺炎与SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV及季节性流感区分开来。
The team also stressed that despite the genetic similarity between the new crown virus and SARS-CoV, some clinical features distinguish it from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and seasonal influenza.
研究得出的中位潜伏期为4天（四分位距，2-7），重度、非重度组新冠患者各有一例患者的潜伏期达24天。
The mean latency was 4 days (quartile, 2-7) and 24 days in each of the patients with severe and non-severe crown.
在这项研究中，潜伏期定义为接触传染源（野生动物或者疑似或确诊病例）的可能最早日期与出现症状（即咳嗽、发热、乏力或肌痛）的可能最早日期之间的间隔期。
In this study, the incubation period was defined as the period between the earliest possible date of exposure to the source of infection (wild animals or suspected or confirmed cases) and the earliest possible date of onset of symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, weakness or muscle pain).
不过，团队认为，单纯根据最小、最大值评估人群的潜伏期容易引起误读。
However, the team believes that it is easy to misinterpret a population's incubation period based solely on minimum and maximum values.
此前在2月9日，该论文在向《新英格兰医学杂志》投稿的同时，也同时在预印本网站medRxiv上率先公开（当时未经同行评议）。
Earlier, on February 9, the paper, while contributing to the New England Journal of Medicine, was first published (without peer review) on the pre-printed website medRxiv.
其中，潜伏期最长达24天是大众关心的热点。
Among them, incubation period of up to 24 days is the focus of public concern.
2月11日，钟南山院士接受央视采访时回应，在预印版里面的潜伏期，我们有一种统计的方法是根据患者的口述来记录下来的，我们根据患者讲述过接触传染源时间以及症状最早出现的时间进行计算，最长的是24天。
In an interview with CCTV on Feb. 11, Academician Zhong Nan Shan responded that during the incubation period of pre-printing plates, we had a statistical method based on patients' dictation.
“但实际上，真正叙述有24天的病人只有1例，也就是说1099例中只有1例。
"But in practice, there was only one patient in 24 days, or only one in 1,099 cases.
以这仅有的1例患者报道的时间作为疾病的最长潜伏期是不够科学，既往其它疾病也有先例，如狂犬病。
It is not scientific enough to report the duration of this single patient as the longest incubation period for disease, and there are precedents for other diseases, such as rabies.
”钟南山说。
"said Zhong Nan Shan.
同时，国内一些省份曾通报多起新冠肺炎超长潜伏期病例。
At the same time, some provinces of the country have reported many cases of hyperlatency of pneumonia.
如2月20日，湖北恩施州确诊一例潜伏期38天无症状新冠肺炎病例。
On Feb. 20, a 38-day incubation period of asymptomatic new crown pneumonia was diagnosed in Enshi, Hubei Province.
2月21日，湖北神农架林区确诊一例潜伏期27天无症状病例。
On February 21, a case of asymptomatic incubation period of 27 days was diagnosed in Shennongchang forest area, Hubei Province.
2月27日，福建莆田市确诊一例潜伏期29天无症状病例。
February 27, Fujian Putian City confirmed a 29-day incubation period asymptomatic cases.
潜伏期指的是易感人群从感染到发病的时间。
Incubation period refers to the susceptible population from infection to the onset of the time.
根据《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案》，基于目前的流行病学调查，潜伏期1-14天，多为3-7天。
According to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Programme, the incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days, based on the current epidemiological investigation.
那么，为什么有的人潜伏期长，有的人短呢？有疾控系统人士告诉界面新闻，潜伏期是根据95%人群得出来的置信区间，不排除有5%的偏差，“这类所谓‘超长潜伏期’的患者只是个例，本身就没有考虑偏差，不足以成为判定最长潜伏期的依据。
The incubation period is based on the confidence interval of 95% of the population and does not exclude a 5% deviation. 'These so-called' ultrallatus' patients are just a case in point and do not themselves take biases into account to determine the maximum incubation period.
”他进一步解释，这种个例可能跟自身暴露有关，由于对病例追踪不十分密切，完全存在其他地方暴露或接触感染者的可能性。
He further explained that such cases may be self-explanatory, and because case tracking is not very close, there is a complete risk of exposure or exposure elsewhere.
“严格意义上讲，必须确保患者发病前21天内没有接触过任何人，甚至没有接触过公共场所的门把手、电梯按钮，才可能证实潜伏期达到21天。
"Strictly speaking, it is important to ensure that no one is contacted during the 21 days preceding the onset of a disease, not even the door knob or elevator button in a public place, before the incubation period can be confirmed to reach 21 days.
”也有专家表示，潜伏期长短与病人本身体质有关，有些人耐受性很好，而一些人则比较“娇气”，稍微有点不舒服就能明显感知到，这种主观性的东西很难去评估。
Other experts say the incubation period is related to a patient's physical constitution, with some people tolerating well while others are more "pampered" and feel slightly uncomfortable, something subjective that is difficult to assess.
而且，病毒进入人体内，没有显示出外在症状，这到底是属于潜伏期还是无症状感染，目前是很难区分的，还需要进一步研究。
What's more, the virus enters the body without showing any external symptoms. Whether it is a latent or asymptomatic infection is difficult to distinguish and requires further study.
上述疾控人士强调，潜伏期是从感染日期到发病日期，而不是从感染日期到确诊日期。
The disease controllers stress that the incubation period is from the date of infection to the date of onset, not from the date of infection to the date of diagnosis.
“比如有患者是2月1日感染，2月8日发病，期间症状不重，一直挺到了2月28号才来看病，那不能说明潜伏期是‌‌27天，‌‌患者的潜伏期依然是7天。
"For example, when a patient is infected on February 1 and falls ill on February 8, the symptoms are not serious until February 28, which does not mean that the incubation period is 27 days for the dog and 7 days for the patient in the poor man
