深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。
Depth and angle - that's what we can do.

说辛苦我们真不觉得，这点辛苦不算什么。
We really don't think hard work, this is nothing.
我们最难过的是很多时候因为供应商停工停产，汽车零部件紧缺，让我们想修都修不好，耽误了事。
Most of the time, because of the supplier shutdown, the shortage of auto parts, so that we want to repair and delay.
到目前为止，我已经记不清出了多少次救援任务了，所有一线防疫人员都是在跟病毒赛跑，我们更不能拖延一秒钟。
So far, I can't remember how many rescue missions there have been. All the frontline vaccinators are racing against the virus, and we can't afford to delay it for a second.
口述 | 谢红亮整理 | 吴 雪2月15日，武汉遭遇大风、雨雪和断崖式降温14℃，气温一下子降到-2℃，路况变得更复杂，给我们的救援工作带来更大的压力。
Xie Hongliang AT & nbsp; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45
那天的江汉大桥上，依然是灯火通明，空旷的桥面上，隔几分钟就有闪着蓝灯的救护车疾驰而过。
On the Jianghan Bridge that day, the lights were still bright, the empty bridge surface, a few minutes after the blue lights of the ambulance rushed by.
当时我在东湖风景区鲁磨路上的修车店里，正拿着75%的酒精喷洒消毒。
I was spraying 75% of the alcohol in a garage on Lu Mill Road in the East Lake Scenic Area.
我是谢红亮，今年37岁，荆州市天门人，在武汉开了一家汽修店。
I am Xie Hongliang, 37 years old, Tianmen, Jingzhou, who opened a garage in Wuhan.
2月1号，我和我们还在武汉的几十个同事，一起成立了一个紧急救援服务队，专门给武汉的医生的车、警察的车、海关的车等等，所有能救援的疫情防控车辆，做免费救援。
On February 1, we also in Wuhan dozens of colleagues, together with the establishment of an emergency rescue service team, Wuhan doctors' cars, police cars, customs cars, and so on, all can rescue the disease prevention and control vehicles, do free rescue.
我的店成立时间并不长，2019年10月才开业。
My shop was not established for a long time and did not open until October 2019.
但是因为开店的时间点正赶上武汉军运会（编者注：第七届世界军人运动会），经营状况很不错。
But since the opening of the store coincided with the Wuhan Military Games (Editor's Note: 7th World Military Games), the business situation is very good.
按照原计划，春节过后，店铺就将陆续回本，日子也能渐渐好起来。
According to the original plan, after the Spring Festival, the shops will continue to return to Ben, the day can also gradually improve.
但是没想到，1月22日疫情突然变得严重起来，本来我们准备“春节不打烊”的，但是临时决定都先关店了。
But I didn't expect the outbreak to get any worse on January 22, when we were going to "close up for the Spring Festival," but the temporary decision was to close.
腊月二十九（1月23日），武汉封城，紧接着，武汉市公交停运，机动车禁行。
On the 29th of January (January 23), Wuhan closed the city, followed by Wuhan city bus stop, motor vehicles banned.
谢红亮的修车店大年初三开始，我陆续接到车友的求助电话，说车辆抛锚了，问我能不能救援。
Xie Hongliang's repair shop began on the third year of the new year, I continued to receive car help calls, said the vehicle broke down, asked me if I can rescue.
那时我的想法很简单：虽然还没开工，但我是个修车人，每个角色有每个角色的任务和价值，更何况在今天这样的特殊时期，我更没有理由退缩。
My idea at the time was simple: I wasn't working yet, but I was a mechanic, and each character had the role and value of each role, and I had no reason to back down at a particular time like today.
当时家里人都在居家隔离，听说我要出去救援，我妻子不是很愿意：“能不能不要出去了，家里还有孩子啊。
When the family was in quarantine and I heard I was going out to help, my wife wasn't very happy: "Can't we just go out and have kids?
”我理解她的想法，但是能做点事情的时候却躲在家里，我干不出来这种事。
"I understood her, but when I could do something and hide at home, I couldn't do it.
经历了一轮“家庭会议”后，我们初步达成共识：义务救援可以去，但是要搬出去到外面住，不能给家里，尤其是孩子带来那么大的风险。
After a round of "family meetings," we have come to a preliminary understanding that the voluntary rescue can go, but to move out to live outside, not to bring so much risk to the family, especially the children.
就这样，我终于又“开工”了。
In this way, I finally "started" again.
谢红亮正在救援一辆救护车我打电话给我们店的技师李永雷，问他愿不愿意跟我一起去救援，他也很积极。
Xie Hongliang is rescuing an ambulance. I called Li Yonglei, a technician in our shop, and asked him if he would like to come with me to the rescue.
李永雷是河南信阳人，武汉封城后就没回去了。
Li Yonglei is Henan Xinyang people, Wuhan after the closure of the city did not go back.
当时武汉基本上没有什么汽修店在营业了，所以我们跑的范围比原来大很多。
At that time, Wuhan was basically no auto repair shop in the business, so we ran a much larger range.
得知救援任务繁重，兄弟门店临江大道店的老板也前来支援我们。
We learned that the rescue task is heavy, brother store Linjiang Road shop owner also came to support us.
第一天，我们就接到了一通特殊的救援电话，求救的是大名鼎鼎的雷神山医院的建设者。
On the first day, we received a special call for help from the well-known builders of Raytheon Mountain Hospital.
那是中建三局的建设车组，主要负责武汉雷神山医院的建设指挥工作。
It is the construction team of the China Construction Bureau, which is mainly responsible for the construction and command of Wuhan Shen Shan Hospital.
对方说接驳工地的指挥车辆，突然出现挂不上挡的故障。
The other side said the connecting site of the command vehicle, suddenly appeared unstoppable failure.
当时雷神山医院刚刚开工三天，我们的店在东湖风景区，他的位置在江夏区强军路，相距超过20公里。
Three days after the construction of Lui Shenshan Hospital, our shop was in the East Lake Scenic Area, his position in the Jiangxia area strong military road, more than 20 kilometers apart.
非常时期，距离不是考虑的主要因素。
In times of stress, distance is not the main consideration.
所以我们接到消息后，立刻赶去现场做了临时处理。
So we received the news, immediately rushed to the scene to do temporary processing.
雷神山医院、火神山医院是全国人民关注的热点，大家不知道的是，这两个地方也是我们救援的热点，后来的几天，我们救援队员来过这里很多次。
Lei Shenshan Hospital, the Fire Goddess Mountain Hospital is the national focus of attention, we do not know that these two places are also our hot spots, the next few days, our rescue team has been here many times.
雷神山医院 图片来源：人民日报微博新闻报道说，2月8日雷神山医院正式投入使用后，到现在已经有不少治愈患者顺利出院了。
People's Daily Weibo News reported that many cured patients have been discharged from Lei Shenshan Hospital since it was put into use on February 8.
看到新闻，我心里特别有成就感。
Seeing the news gives me a special sense of accomplishment.
随着疫情发展，原本我们自发进行的救援，越来越力不从心。
With the development of the epidemic, the original spontaneous rescue, more and more beyond the capacity.
1月底，了解到“抗疫前线”对汽车救援需求很大，汽修人必须尽快出动的情况，公司开始紧急介入。
At the end of January, learning that the "front line of the epidemic" to rescue the car in great demand, auto repair had to move out as soon as possible, the company began emergency intervention.
2月1日，公司宣布紧急救援服务队正式成立，24小时免费救援，所有的费用公司承担，这下我们找到“靠山”了。
February 1, the company announced the official establishment of the emergency rescue team, 24-hour free rescue, all the cost of the company to bear, we found the "anchor."
救援群很快建好了，当时群里人员一共有76个，包括客服、运营、修车师傅等，还开通了救援专线电话：400-111-8896。
The rescue team was soon built, with a total of 76 personnel, including customer service, operations, car mechanic, and a dedicated rescue line: 400-111-8896.
客服在接到求助后，确认是否为医护人员、志愿者和保障人员，然后根据距离远近，统一分配到临近区域的救援队员手上。
Upon receiving help, the customer service identifies the medical staff, volunteers and support staff, and then distributes them uniformly to nearby rescue teams, depending on distance.
后来的日子里，我们又救援了警察公务车、志愿者送餐车、医护人员接驳车、电视台直播车等。
In the following days, we also rescued the police official car, the volunteer delivery car, medical staff feeder car, television station live car, and so on.
按照要求，我们需要24小时待命的，所以哪怕凌晨一两点出动去救援，也不是什么稀罕事。
As required, we need to be on 24-hour standby, so it's not uncommon for us to call in at least one or two in the morning.
很多人和我说“你们辛苦了”，其实接触了那么多行走在防治疫情路上的人，我觉得医务人员才真是最辛苦的。
A lot of people said to me, "you have to work hard," in fact contact with so many people walking on the road to combat the epidemic, I think the medical staff is really the hardest.
在我们救援的车辆里，医护人员是占比最大的之一。
Of the vehicles we rescued, paramedics accounted for one of the largest proportions.
而且他们大多有一个共同点：看上去特别疲累，十个有九个都是黑眼圈；如果车坏了有故障，只能下夜班的轮休日来修。
And most of them have one thing in common: they look particularly tired, with nine out of ten having black eye circles; if their car breaks down, they can only be repaired on night shifts.
最让我心疼的是两口子都在前线的，孩子只能送到亲戚家暂时照看，这样医生有很多。
Most of my heartache is the couple are in the front line, the children can only be sent to relatives temporary care, so there are many doctors.
每每我去医院紧急救援医生车辆的时候，看到在他们排成一排席地而睡，我心里都特别难受。
When I go to a hospital emergency doctor's car, I feel sick to see them sleeping in rows.

2月18日，有一名车主求助，车子打不着火了。
On 18 February, a car owner asked for help and the car could not be fired upon.
到地方之后，才发现车主的身份有些特殊——武汉市病毒研究所的研究员。
After arriving the place, only then discovered the owner's identity some special - Wuhan City virus research institute researcher.
因为工作需要，他需要经常往返金银潭医院。
He had to commute frequently to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital because of his work.
任务紧急，检查了车辆之后我发现，需要更换电瓶。
Mission emergency. After checking the vehicles, I found that the battery needed to be replaced.
我快速返回公司仓库，找到了一个电瓶，帮他免费换了，型号虽然不一样，但在保证安全的情况下，解了他的燃眉之急。
I quickly returned to the company warehouse, found a battery, to help him free change, although the model is not the same, but in order to ensure safety, solve his immediate needs.
谢红亮与李永雷在武汉病毒所修完车， 拍下了照片最让我难忘的是下雪的那次救援，让我心里很温暖。
Xie Hongliang and Li Yonglei in Wuhan virus completed the car, photographed the most memorable snow is the rescue, let me very warm heart.
那天下着雨夹雪，气温降到-2℃。
It was raining and snowing and the temperature was -2 ℃.
武汉中南医院的医生一早打电话求助，说他的车子两个轮胎都没气了，找了一圈都没有修车店开门。
Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital doctor called early to help, said his car both tires are out of gas, looking for a circle did not repair the car shop opened.
我一听是医护人员的车，赶紧拿了根气棒，很快就过去了。
As soon as I heard that it was the paramedics' car, I grabbed an air-stick and quickly passed.
去的路上，又接到这位医生的电话：“天气那么冷，要不你们别来了，我很过意不去。
On the way there was a telephone call from the doctor again. "It's so cold, otherwise you won't come.
”本身都在危险的一线没日没夜地战斗，他还在担心我们辛苦，让我唏嘘不已。
"In a dangerous line of battle day and night, he is still worried about our hard work, let me sob.
我说没问题，安心等着我来就行。
I said no problem, just wait for me.
到地方后发现需要补胎，我和李永雷给两个车胎充了气，支撑着把车开到了店里进行补胎。
When we got to the place and found we needed a flat tire, I and Li Yonglei gave two tires full of air and propped it up to the shop for a flat tire repair.
这位医生一再对我们表示感谢，说得我都不好意思，你说我们做的工作，哪里及得上他们啊！武汉雨夹雪，气温降到-2℃，救援队员冒着雨雪外出救援谢红亮正在检查轮胎我只是途虎养车紧急救援服务队中的其中一员，与我并肩作战的还有从海南连夜开车返回武汉的修车师傅李昌，95后的年轻师傅卢顺以及奋斗在孝感、郑州、西安的其他三支，好几十个人组成的大队伍。
The doctor thanked us again and again and said that I was ashamed to say that the work we had done did not reach them! Wuhan rain and snow, the temperature fell to -2 degrees Celsius, rescue team members braving rain and snow go out to rescue Xie Hongliang I was just driving back from Hainan overnight to Wuhan, Lu Shun, a young master and dozens of others fighting in filial piety, Zhengzhou, Xi'an.
说辛苦我们真不觉得，这点辛苦不算什么。
We really don't think hard work, this is nothing.
我们最难过的是很多时候因为供应商停工停产，汽车零部件紧缺，让我们想修都修不好，耽误了事。
Most of the time, because of the supplier shutdown, the shortage of auto parts, so that we want to repair and delay.
到目前为止，我已经记不清出了多少次救援任务了，所有一线防疫人员都是在跟病毒赛跑，我们更不能拖延一秒钟。
So far, I can't remember how many rescue missions there have been. All the frontline vaccinators are racing against the virus, and we can't afford to delay it for a second.
救援服务队队员在工作中武汉街道以往热闹的景象2月20日晚上九点，我坐在宿舍的高低床，看着一张张救援的照片，回想往年春节时候，武汉市区都是最热闹的，街头随处可见的早点摊，挤公交的上班族，堵在路上的车流……满满的都是烟火气。
Wuhan city is the busiest city in the world, with scores of street vendors, busy commuters, and traffic jams... filled with fireworks, as I sit in my dorm bed at 9pm on Feb. 20, looking back at pictures of rescue efforts.
而今天，在武汉街头，突然间变了景象，荒凉刺骨而来，静下心数，每隔一会就有一辆鸣笛的救护车开过。
Today, in Wuhan, the street, suddenly changed the scene, bleak and piercing, quiet the heart count, every once in a while a siren of ambulances drove by.
最近几天，雨雪过后武汉放晴了，我和许多武汉人一样，等待着这座城市好起来。
In recent days, Wuhan cleared up after the rain and snow, I and many Wuhan people, waiting for the city to get better.
