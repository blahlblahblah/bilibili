对比其他地方的疫情，中国香港特区此前并未进入持续本地暴发状态。
Hong Kong SAR of China did not enter a sustained local outbreak as compared with other outbreaks elsewhere.
“从疫症开始以来，当下的香港才处于疫情传播最高风险的时候。
"Since the outbreak began, Hong Kong is at the highest risk of spreading the disease.
”在过去一周当中，香港特区累计确诊119例新冠肺炎病例，与此次疫情爆发后前50天的确诊总人数大致相当。
In the past week, a cumulative total of 119 cases of new crown pneumonia were diagnosed in the HKSAR, about the same number as in the first 50 days after the outbreak.

文|《财经》特派香港记者焦建编辑|苏琦3月20日，受外来“倒灌”病例（香港称“个案”）迅速增加等因素叠加影响，中国香港特别行政区（下简称“香港特区”）迎来了自2020年1月底以来新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊感染病例新增数字最多的一天。
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (HKSAR) has seen the largest number of confirmed new cases of coronavirus pneumonia since late January 2020, thanks to a combination of factors such as the rapid increase in foreign "reverse irrigation" cases (Hong Kong SAR) on March 20.
在新增48例（另有4例初步确认，确诊者中年龄最小者仅4岁）确诊病例后，香港特区累计确诊感染人数达256人。
A cumulative total of 256 cases were diagnosed in the HKSAR following the confirmation of 48 new cases (4 cases were confirmed at the earliest age of 4).
48例这一数字打破了本周此前时候单日新增25例的记录。
The 48 cases broke the record of 25 new cases a day earlier this week.
可进行对比的情况是：在过去一周当中，香港特区累计确诊119例，已与此次疫情爆发后前50天的确诊总人数大致相当。
By way of comparison, the cumulative total number of 119 confirmed cases in the HKSAR over the past week is about the same as the total number confirmed in the first 50 days after the outbreak.
正因如此，香港防疫各界相关人士纷纷于当日发出警告称：随着大量香港居民返港后带来的新增风险、加之疫情持续时间较长令香港居民产生程度不一的松懈心理，使得香港疫情防控体系将迎来十分严峻的考验。
As a result, Hong Kong's epidemic prevention community warned on the same day that the new risks posed by the large number of Hong Kong residents returning to Hong Kong, coupled with the extended duration of the outbreak, would put Hong Kong's disease prevention and control system to a severe test.
防疫相对乐观的形势或将结束背后，香港特区正在做什么？还将做什么？病毒繁殖率突破“1”意味着什么？香港特区新增确诊病例迅速增加背后，既有普遍原因，又有特殊原因。
What is the HKSAR doing? What will it do? What does it mean for the virus to proliferate beyond "1"? There are both common reasons and special reasons behind the rapid increase in the number of newly diagnosed cases in the HKSAR.
首先，在过去一周内新增的119名确诊感染者当中，其中84%的人曾有离港出游记录。
First of all, 84% of the 119 new cases diagnosed in the past week had a history of travel outside Hong Kong.
此外亦有部分香港留学生为受欧美疫情失控影响波及，决定暂时回港。
In addition, some Hong Kong students decided to return to Hong Kong temporarily because of the uncontrolled epidemic in Europe and the United States.
较为特殊的因素，则是香港不少居民受此前香港新增病例趋缓形势影响，开始对疫情防控产生较为乐观态度。
A special factor is that many Hong Kong residents, affected by the previously slowing down of new cases in Hong Kong, are beginning to be optimistic about disease prevention and control.
有关香港在此次疫情防控中吸取非典经验、成功通过限制人流取得成果的报道，此前亦有所传播。
Reports that Hong Kong has learned from the SARS experience in the prevention and control of the epidemic and have succeeded in achieving results by limiting the flow of people have also been disseminated.
此次疫情传播至今，除部分公务员曾居家办公一个月左右之外，大部分的香港市民春节后返工并未推迟；地铁、巴士等公共交通体系基本照常运行；商场、餐饮行业除因多重因素造成客流减少主动缩短营业时间外，并未出现大规模行业性限制经营措施。
Apart from the fact that some civil servants have been away from home for about a month, most of the public transport system such as subway and bus has been running normally. Apart from reducing passenger flow due to multiple factors, there are no large-scale industry-specific restrictions on business.
从春节起至今，《财经》记者在港外出到公共场所采访时发现：除部分诊所等特殊场所必须要求戴口罩之外，香港人的生活受疫情直接影响较大的是排队购买口罩及抢购厕纸、大米等，其余无论社交、购物等活动只要个人愿意外出，基本均可照常继续进行。
From the Spring Festival to the present, Caijing reporters outside Hong Kong to cover public places found that in addition to some special places such as clinics must wear masks, Hong Kong people's lives are directly affected by the epidemic is queuing up to buy toilet paper, rice, etc. The rest of the activities, whether social or shopping, can continue as long as individuals are willing to go out.
在3月20日新增的确诊病例当中，就大致涉及了四个群组的感染场景，包括兰桂坊聚会（6人）、PURE Fitness健身中心、愉景湾婚礼（4人）及疫情传播期间外出的加拿大旅行团。
Of the new cases confirmed on March 20, roughly four groups of infection were involved, including a Langui Fong gathering (6), a PURE Fitness Fitness Centre, a Discovery Bay wedding (4) and a Canadian tour during the spread of the outbreak.
3月20日，香港大学（下称港大）医学院世卫传染病流行病学及控制合作中心发表新型冠状病毒即时有效繁殖率实况报告显示，在新增数字增加背后，亦蕴藏一些不容乐观的新趋势：在此之前，香港特区卫生防护中心曾指出，14天潜伏期内曾到过外地及留在本地的人士，均列为“可能本地个案”，即无法确定感染地。
On March 20, the WHO Collaborating Centre on Epidemiology and Control of Infectious Diseases of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released a fact sheet on the Immediate Effective Fertility Rate of the Coronavirus.
但中国香港特区政府专家顾问团成员、港大医学院公共卫生医学讲座教授梁卓伟则在当日的新闻发布会上指出：大部分新冠肺炎个案的潜伏期，都是在一星期内，研究团队研究这些“灰色地带人士”的曝露史、外游史及发病日期，以科学方法重新编配个案源头后，发现本港3月绝大部分的个案，均为输入个案。
At a press conference on the same day, Professor Leung Cheuk-wai, Professor of Public Health Medicine at HKU, a member of the Hong Kong SAR Government's Expert Advisory Panel, said at a press conference that the incubation period of most new cases was within one week.
该报告还分析了此次疫情截止到目前三个时期的输入型个案的相关情况：初期时由内地输入；随后则是“钻石公主号”输入；目前则是由欧美国家输入。
The report also contains an analysis of the imported cases from the Mainland at the beginning, the Princess Diamond at the beginning, and those from Europe and the United States at the moment.
相较之下，当下第三阶段的输入数字总数预计还会加剧，规模超过前两个阶段。
In contrast, the total number of incoming figures for the current phase III is expected to increase further than in the previous two phases.
对比其他地方的疫情，香港其实未进入持续本地爆发，甚至是“第一波都未有（到来）。
Hong Kong, by contrast, has not entered a sustained local outbreak, or even a "first wave."
”梁卓伟称，“从疫症开始以来，当下的香港才处于疫情传播最高风险的时候。
"Since the outbreak began, Hong Kong is at the highest risk of spreading the disease," he said.
”支撑其判断的论据为：计算病毒繁殖率的指标有两种，分别是病源体的传染性强度，以及居住环境因素，即是居住密度、繁荣程度、社交接触等。
The evidence supporting his judgment is that there are two indicators of viral fertility: the infectious intensity of the pathogen, and residential environmental factors, such as residential density, prosperity, and social contact.
用病源体传染性强度计算，新冠病毒的基本繁殖率大概是2，即一名患者会传染给二人。
Based on the infectious intensity of the pathogen, the basic reproductive rate of the new crown virus is about 2, that is, one patient can infect two people.
结合环境因素，病毒的即时繁殖率会每天转变，要视乎公共卫生、防疫措施成效。
Combined with environmental factors, the immediate reproduction rate of the virus will change daily, depending on the effectiveness of public health and epidemic prevention measures.
“从3月第二星期起，香港的即时繁殖率超过1（截至3月18日，即时繁殖率大约为1.2至1.3），这是‘风险转折’，也是危险警号，代表香港有可能即将发生大型本地爆发。
"Since the second week of March, the rate of instant reproduction in Hong Kong has exceeded 1 (the instant reproduction rate as at 18 March was about 1.2 to 1.3). This is a 'risk turning point' and a red flag that Hong Kong is on the verge of a major local outbreak.
”梁卓伟称，“新冠病毒容易出现群组病例，海外输入个案存在很大的潜在风险，倘有大型的二代、三代群组传播，后果将非常严重。
"The new crown virus is prone to cohort cases and there is a high potential risk of overseas importation," said Mr Leung. "The consequences of large-scale second-generation and third-generation transmission would be severe.
”抗疫体系加速承压社区传播扩大风险增加，将给香港此前一个阶段运行较为平稳的抗疫体系带来较大压力，前端及后端如何做好防控，备受关注。
The increased risk of accelerating community transmission under stress will put more pressure on Hong Kong's relatively smooth anti-epidemic system in the previous phase, and attention will be paid to the prevention and control of the front and back ends.
就前端而言：对于当下趋势，香港特区政府行政会议成员林正财则在近日时指出，“确诊个案上升是预计之内，因有大批人返港，这一浪主要是不听劝喻继续外游而带病毒返港者，及早前回港学生；近日每天有数千港人经机场返港，且多来自爆（发）疫（情）的地方。
On the front end, Mr Lam Ching-cheuk, a member of the Executive Council of the HKSAR Government, said recently that "the increase in confirmed cases is expected. With the large number of people returning to Hong Kong, the trend is mainly due to returning students returning to Hong Kong without advice.
按近日确诊个案增速推算，料未来有可能单日过百宗，且暂时未知回流潮何时结束。
Based on recent estimates of the rate of increase in confirmed cases, it is expected that there may be more than 100 cases per day in the future.
”因行政会议是协助香港特区行政长官决策的机构（行政长官在作出重要决策、向立法会提交法案、制定附属法规等之前，须征询行政会议的意见），故而其成员的公开表态亦较为受到外界关注。
Since the Executive Council is the body that assists the Chief Executive of the HKSAR in making important policy decisions, introducing bills to the Legislative Council, making subordinate legislation, etc., he has to consult the Executive Council. The public pronouncements of its members have also attracted considerable attention.
而林正财则指出：香港特区政府仍希望理性、客观及科学化去抗疫。
But Lin Zhengchang points out that the HKSAR government still wants to fight the disease rationally, objectively and scientifically.
目前通过饭局、婚宴及饮酒而感染的个案数目多，问题很清晰，专家纷纷向他表达关注。
Experts have expressed concern about the high number of cases of infection through meals, weddings and alcohol consumption, which are clear.
希望政府短时间内推出措施限制食肆的营业等措施，但一刀切禁止食肆营业可能难以做到。
It is hoped that the Government will soon introduce measures to restrict the operation of restaurants. However, a blanket ban on restaurants may be difficult to achieve.
前端个案不断增加之下，防疫体系的救治压力正在增加。
With the increasing number of front-end cases, the treatment pressure of epidemic prevention system is increasing.
据《财经》记者获悉：3月19日时，香港特区相关部门曾发出邮件称：近几日返港者急增，占用大量负压隔离病房。
According to Caijing, on March 19, the relevant departments of the Hong Kong SAR had sent e-mails saying that the number of returnees to Hong Kong in recent days had surged, occupying a large number of negative pressure isolation wards.
两日间逾50人在机场等候送院，全港所有医院的负压隔离病房一度饱和（AIIR in all HA hospitals were not available）。
More than 50 people were waiting to be hospitalized at the airport for two days, and the negative pressure isolation wards (AIIR in all hospitals in Hong Kong) were once saturated.
《财经》杂志此前报道显示：按照香港特区的医疗安排，对于新型冠状病毒肺炎疑似病例，各个联网医院均有负气压隔离病房、受过相关培训的医护人员，并有化验室支援，都可处理确诊个案。
As previously reported by Caijing magazine, under the medical arrangements of the Hong Kong SAR, negative pressure isolation wards, specially trained medical staff and laboratory support are available in all networked hospitals for suspected cases of coronavirus pneumonia.
在加强监测计划下，需化验的病人都会先收入负压病房隔离，但随着个案增加可能会转而先收入监察病房，病房内床与床间会有1米距离、最少每小时6次换气，并加装空气过滤仪器，员工亦会穿上全套保护衣，减少院内感染。
Under the enhanced surveillance programme, patients requiring testing will be placed in negative pressure ward isolation first. However, as the number of cases increases, they may be transferred to the monitoring wards. The beds in the wards will be ventilated at least 6 times an hour and air filtration equipment will be installed. Staff will also wear full protective clothing to reduce nosocomial infections.
对于被确诊感染人群，根据香港特区政府医管局的应变计划安排：目前香港的确诊病人会被送往玛嘉烈医院的传染病中心处理，其后确诊病人会由7个医院联网的主要急症医院分别接收。
For confirmed infected persons, according to the contingency plan of the HA of the HKSAR Government, confirmed patients in Hong Kong will now be taken to the Centre for Infectious Diseases at Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment, and thereafter confirmed patients will be taken up separately by the seven major acute hospitals linked by the seven hospitals.
有部分医护人员则向香港本地传媒透露称：本周时玛嘉烈医院的负压隔离病床曾一度只剩个位数，转移疑似病例在此次疫情期间被首次“拒收”后转送至其他医院。
Some doctors and nurses told local Hong Kong media that the negative pressure isolation beds at Princess Margaret Hospital were once in single digits this week. Suspected cases were transferred to other hospitals after being "rejected" for the first time during the outbreak.
据3月20日时香港医管局公布的最新官方数据则显示：目前香港公立医院有954张负压隔离病床和507间负压隔离病房，使用率分别为46.3%和70.6%。
According to the latest official figures released by HA on 20 March, there are currently 954 negative pressure isolation beds and 507 negative pressure isolation wards in public hospitals in Hong Kong, with utilization rates of 46.3% and 70.6% respectively.
保护装备方面，有2400万个外科口罩、150万个N95、保护衣250万件、面罩270万个，外科口罩和保护衣存量约够用两个月，N95口罩则够用约一个月。
In terms of protective equipment, there are 24 million surgical masks, 1.5 million N95, 2.5 million protective clothing, 2.7 million face masks, approximately two months of surgical masks and protective clothing, and about one month for N95 masks.
上述各项数字均“不太宽裕”背后，目前香港医护界的普遍观点是：虽医疗体系目前仍能应付，但若输入个案来得急且快，院内高风险程序增加，出现院内感染，医护感染风险会增加。
All these figures are "not very generous." The prevailing view among the healthcare sector in Hong Kong is that while the health care system is still able to cope with the current situation, the risk of medical infection will increase if the intake of cases is rapid and rapid, with an increase in high-risk hospital procedures and nosocomial infections.
当下最重要的措施仍是围堵输入个案，避免将病毒传开，否则估计确诊者升至逾2000人时，公立医院体系就会超负荷，部分确诊者或不能入院治疗。
The most important measure is to contain the incoming cases and avoid spreading the virus. Otherwise, it is estimated that when the number of confirmed cases rises to over 2,000, the public hospital system will become overloaded and some of those diagnosed may not be hospitalized.
压力链传导之下，为避免交叉感染及出现病症者在香港机场这一人群流入重点渠道滞留，香港特区政府已经在香港机场附近、于2005年12月启用的亚洲国际博览馆内的5号展馆设立了两个临时检测中心。
In order to avoid cross-infection and the influx of patients from Hong Kong airport into key channels, the HKSAR Government has set up two temporary testing centres near Hong Kong Airport, Pavilion 5 of the AsiaWorld-Expo, which opened in December 2005.
该中心内设有护士站和化验报告列印站，场内摆放多张椅，每张椅均相隔约6个身位的距离，供接受检测人士即场等候。
Nurse stations and laboratory report printing stations are set up at the Centre. There are a number of chairs, each about 6 places apart, which are available for immediate testing.
相关医护人员为有关人士抽取样本后送往医院化验室，期间入境人士要在检测中心等候，最新的预计显示运送及测试过程需时大约半天至1天。
Samples are taken by the healthcare professionals concerned and sent to the hospital laboratory. During this period, the inbound visitors are expected to wait at the testing centre. The latest estimates indicate that the delivery and testing process will take about half a day to one day.
倘若有人测试结果呈阳性，会送往公立医院隔离治疗，呈阴性者可返回居所继续14日家居检疫。
If someone tests positive, they are sent to a public hospital for isolation and treatment. Those who are negative can return to their homes for 14 days of home quarantine.
此外，较年长入境香港的人士则将会被送往北大屿山医院的检测中心；入境人士如有医疗需要，则可能会被安排直接送往不同公立医院。
In addition, older persons arriving in Hong Kong will be taken to the testing centre of the North Lantau Hospital. For medical needs, they may be arranged to be taken directly to different public hospitals.
香港特区政府食物及卫生局局长陈肇始在3月20日时则指出：过去两周从外地入境大都是香港人，目前港人及非港人同样要强制隔离十四日，政府会继续监察。
On March 20, the Secretary for Food and Health of the HKSAR Government, Mr Chan Siu-kwong, pointed out that the majority of people entering Hong Kong from outside Hong Kong in the past two weeks were Hong Kong residents. People from Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong people are also subject to mandatory isolation for 14 days.
留意到市民的社交距离“做得不好”，不排除禁非港人入境香港等更严厉措施。
Note that the public's social distance is "not doing well" and does not preclude more stringent measures such as prohibiting non-Hong Kong residents from entering Hong Kong.
香港特区立法会卫生事务委员会亦在当日召开会议，多名议员商议全面禁止非港人入境。
The Health Services Committee of the Legislative Council also held a meeting on the same day to discuss a comprehensive ban on non-Hong Kong residents.
亦有资深大律师指出：特区政府可按香港法例第599A章《预防及控制疾病规例》制立相关法例，减低病毒在社区传播。
There is also a Senior Counsel who has stated that the HKSAR Government may enact legislation to reduce the spread of the virus in the community in accordance with the Prevention and Control of Disease Regulations, Cap. 599A.
香港特区政府卫生防护中心传染病处主任张竹君亦在同日表示：“封关”未必可以减少确诊数字。
The Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, Mr Matthew Cheung Chuk-jun, said on the same day that the closure would not necessarily reduce the number of confirmed cases.
以20日的确诊个案为例，只有一人为非本港人士。
In the 20-day confirmed case, for example, there was only one non-Hong Kong person.
强制检疫反可减少其在发病前的社交活动，阻止病毒于社区蔓延。
Compulsory quarantine in turn can reduce their social activities before the onset of illness and prevent the spread of the virus in the community.
如何降低港人的社交频次及范围，是目前香港特区防疫的核心难题之一。
How to reduce the frequency and scope of social contacts in Hong Kong is one of the core problems in Hong Kong's epidemic prevention.
港大医学院3月10日至13日访问1005名香港人的调查显示：仅85%受访者称会避免到人多挤迫地方，84%表示会尽量留在家中，两者均较一个月前的调查跌约5个百分点。
A survey of 1,005 Hong Kong people conducted by the Hong Kong University Medical School from March 10 to 13 showed that only 85% of the respondents said they would avoid overcrowding and 84% said they would try to stay at home.
“本月初时兰桂坊仍是门可罗雀，这几天又开始人多起来了。
"At the beginning of this month, Langui Fern is still a small door, these days began to more people.
仿佛戴了口罩去健身房或者酒吧、食肆就能万事大吉，近期港人的防疫意识令人担忧。
As if wearing a mask to the gym or bars, restaurants can be all right, the recent Hong Kong people's vaccination awareness is worrying.
希望学者们说香港已进入‘战时状态’能起到点效果，实在不行下周开始只能申请居家办公了。
Hopefully, academics will say Hong Kong has entered a 'wartime state' that will have some effect, and it's hard to start applying from home next week.
”在香港中环地区上班的一位金融界人士对《财经》记者称。
A financier working in Central Hong Kong told Caijing.
其公司推出相关安排，是因多名员工子女近日由外地返港后需居家隔离，存在员工因此被感染风险。
The company introduced the arrangement because of the risk of staff being exposed to the risk of infection when their children are separated from their families after their recent return from overseas.
“市民要保持警惕，不要放松防疫意识，否则会白费了过去两个月的防疫努力成果。
"Members of the public should remain vigilant and not relax their vaccination awareness, otherwise the results of the vaccination efforts of the past two months will be wasted.
”梁卓伟在前述的发布会进行时曾多番提醒称。
Mr Leung recalled many times during the above-mentioned press conference.
其还预计：距离全球第一波疫情爆发完结，最低限度还有几个月。
It also predicted that the first global outbreak would be over, at least for a few months.
如果全球第一波在未来数月发生，而且慢慢回落，香港可能6月或7月左右有“喘息”的空间，但因大部份人未有抗体，到第二波疫情开始，仍要面对被感染风险；如运气不好，全球随时要待第三波疫情爆发，才有希望看到疫苗产生。
If the first global wave occurs in the coming months and slowly recedes, Hong Kong may have "breathing space" around June or July, but since most people do not have antibodies, they will still be at risk of infection by the start of the second wave.
