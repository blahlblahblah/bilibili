"I am convinced that the means we have taken, and the measures I am announcing today, are working well to stop the spread of the virus.

我要向大家介绍的是大家已经熟知的英国副首席医务官——珍妮·哈里斯女士以及首席科学顾问，帕特里克·瓦兰斯先生。
I would like to introduce Ms. Jenny Harris, Deputy Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom, and Mr. Patrick Varens, Chief Scientific Adviser, as you know.
I want to tell you where we got to in our national fightback against the coronavirus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to discuss the latest evidence on the spread of the virus and the effects of the measures we have already taken to slow its spread. And Patrick is going to update us in a second about that.我希望告诉大家在这场抗击新冠病毒的反击战中，英国目前的抗击形势如何。
I want to tell you what the UK is doing in the fight against the new crown virus. Today the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies met to address the implications of the measures we have already.Ann Patrick is going to update us in a second fight against the new crown virus.
今天，紧急事件科学顾问团刚刚在这里会面，讨论病毒扩散的最新证据，以及关于我们已经采取的减缓措施所产生的效果。
Today, the Scientific Advisory Panel on Emergencies has just met here to discuss the latest evidence of the spread of the virus and the impact of the mitigation measures we have taken.
帕特里克稍后将给出更为详细的解说。
Patrick will give a more detailed explanation later.
I want to repeat that everyone – everyone – must follow the advice to protect themselves and their families, but also – more importantly – to protect the wider public. So stay at home for seven days if you think you have the symptoms. Remember the two key symptoms are high temperature, a continuous new cough.我想要重复强调的是：每个人－必须是每个人－都要遵从保护自身和家庭的建议，更为重要的是－每个人都必须守护更广大的公众。
I want to repeat this: everyone - who must be everyone - follows the advice to protect themselves and their families, and more importantly - everyone must guard the wider public.
所以，如果你觉得自己有相关症状，请在家隔离7天。
So if you feel you have symptoms, stay home for 7 days.
请记住最为关键的两个症状是发烧和新发的持续咳嗽。
Remember that the two most critical symptoms are fever and a persistent cough.
Whole household to stay at home for 14 days if one member in that household thinks he/she has the symptoms. Avoid all unnecessary gatherings – pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, theatres and so on and work from home if you can. Wash your hands.如果家庭当中有一位家人有相似症状，每个家庭成员都须要在家隔离14天。
Whole household to day at home for 14 days if one member in that house think he / she has the symptoms. Avoid all unneccessary gathers-pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, thus and so on and work from home if one of the family members has similar symptoms.
请避免所有不必要的集会－无论是在酒馆、俱乐部、酒吧、餐厅还是剧院或者是其他地方，尽己所能在家工作，并且勤洗手。
Avoid all unnecessary gatherings - whether in pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants or theatres or elsewhere - and do your best to work from home and wash your hands frequently.
And we have already announced in the last few days we will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day.另外我们过去几天已经宣布，在即将到来的数周内我们会将检测力度大幅提高，实现每天执行2.5万次病毒检测的目标。
And we have announced in the past few days that we will significantly scale up testing in the coming weeks to achieve the target of 25,000 tests per day.
A huge public information campaign is being rolled out so people get all the information they need to protect themselves and others.公众可以从正在举办的大型公共信息宣传活动中得到如何保护自身及他人的有效信息。
A huge public information campaign is being carried out by so many people get all the information they need to protect them and others. The public can get effective information about how to protect themselves and others from the large-scale public information campaigns that are being organized.
We are asking retired healthcare professionals to come back and help us cope, help the NHS to cope, with this unprecedented challenge.那些已经退休的医护专业人士也被请回来帮助我们和国家医疗服务系统（NHS）一起来应对这起史无前例的挑战。
We are working to restore health care facilities to come back and help us cope with this unprecedented challenge, help the NHS to scope, with this unsecured challenge.
And we will continue as we have from the beginning to do the right thing at the right time and to follow the best scientific advice.我们会继续我们从最初就一直在实行的方案，听从最科学的建议，在正确的时机实施正确的措施。
We will continue the programme we have been implementing from the beginning, following the most scientific advice and implementing the right measures at the right time.
And we come today to the key issue of schools where we have been consistently advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the judgment of our advisers has been that closing schools is actually of limited value in slowing the spread of the epidemic.今天我们将会谈论关于学校的关键问题，我们的顾问们不停息地提议到学校问题的关键在于权衡各种的利弊。
Today we are going to talk about the crucial issue of schools, where we have been between consistent advised that there is an important trade off. And so far the justice of our admirers has been that closing schools of practice.
截至目前，基于顾问们的建议我们所作出的判断是，即使关闭学校，对减缓病毒传播的作用仍是非常有限的。
So far, based on the advice of the consultants, we have concluded that even if schools are closed, their impact on mitigating the spread of the virus is very limited.
And that is partly because counterintuitively schools are actually very safe environments. And in this disease and epidemic children and young people are much less vulnerable.我们做出这个违反直觉的判断，有一部分原因是，学校事实上属于非常安全的环境。
We made this counterintuitive judgement in part because the school was in fact a very safe place to live. And in this case and epidemical children and young people are aware of this counterintuitive judgement.
并且在这次流行性疾病中，孩子和年轻人实际上没有那么易感。
And in this epidemic, children and young people are actually less susceptible.
And hitherto the advice has been that we should keep schools open if possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and on all other public services. But I think you’ll agree I have always been very clear that this is a balanced judgment and one that we have kept under constant review.到昨天为止，我们的建议一直是在可能的情形下让学校保持开放，以此减少NHS和其他公众服务所面临的压力。
As of yesterday, our proposal has been to keep schools open whenever possible in order to reduce the pressure on the NHS and other public services.
当然我坚信你会同意我所一再强调的，这是一个权衡各种利弊的决定，所以我们时时都可能重新评价和考虑。
I am sure, of course, that you will agree with me, as I have repeatedly stressed, that this is a decision that balances the pros and cons, so that we may re-evaluate and reconsider from time to time.
So looking at the curve of the disease and looking at where we are now – we think now that we must apply downward pressure, further downward pressure on that upward curve by closing the schools.我们现在将目光转向疫情本身，看看我们现在处于疫情曲线图的什么位置－我认为我们必须施加向下的压力，进一步阻止曲线的上升趋势，这就要求我们关闭学校。
We now turn our attention to the epidemic itself, to see where we are now on the epidemic chart - I think we have to put downward pressure to further stop the upward trend in the curve, which requires us to close schools.
So I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils – for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.因此，今日我与加文·威廉姆森在下议院共同宣布，周五下午放学后，学校全部关门，并对绝大多数学生保持关闭，直到有新的通知为止。
So today I announced with Gavin Williamson, in the House of Commons that after school they put their feet from Friday aftoon, they will be closed for the last main body - for the vast majorityof puppies. I will play what I mean by the vast majority until further notice.
我会对“绝大多数学生”这一概念做出解释。
I will explain the concept of "the vast majority of students."
The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.我们的目标是减缓病毒的传播，并且我们判断这是采取此一行动的正确时机。
The objective is to slow the spread of the virus, and we judge that this is the right time to do so.
But of course, as I’ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work.当然就像我一直在强调的，我们同时也需要保持NHS的正常运转，这样才可以治疗那些不断攀升的病例。
But of course, as I have been stressing, we also need to keep the NHS running so that we can treat the rising cases.
因此我们需要让那些为人父母的医护人员能继续完成他们的工作。
So we need to let the parent healthcare professionals continue to do their job.
And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too – from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.与此同时，我们需要其他的关键性工种的工作人员们继续留在自己的岗位上－从确保我们安全的警官们，到超市的送货司机们，以及照料那些对我们至关重要的老人的社会保健工作者们。
At the same time, we need other key types of workers to remain in their jobs - from the police officers who make sure we are safe, to the delivery drivers in supermarkets. We will be looking out for more detail out of who we are.
我们将很快给出对这类人群的详细定义。
A detailed definition of this group will be given shortly.
So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.因此，我们需要学校对这些关键岗位工作人员的子女们开放，以免他们的父母被迫留在家里照看孩子。
So we need schools that are open to the children of workers in these key positions so that their parents are not forced to stay at home to look after their children.
而且，他们也需要照看那些最易感的孩子。
And they have to take care of the most susceptible children.
This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.这将意味着学校内的学生数量会锐减，这将帮助我们减缓病毒的传播速度。
This will mean a significant reduction in the number of students in schools, which will help us slow down the spread of the virus.
这些措施同时对于维持经济和公共服务的运转而言，也是不可或缺的关键所在。
These measures are also essential for maintaining the functioning of the economy and public services.
So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. And of course this does mean that exams will not take place as planned in May and June. Though we will make sure that pupils get the qualifications they need and deserve for their academic career.所以我们同时也要求托儿所和私立学校按上述指令关闭校园，我在这里澄清，我们将会补偿这一措施所带来的损失。
So we also require nurseries and private schools to close their campuses in accordance with the above-mentioned directive. I want to make sure that we compensate for the loss of this measure.
当然，原定将于5月与6月进行的考试也将取消。
Of course, the examinations scheduled for May and June will also be cancelled.
但是我们仍将确保学生们取得他们所需的证书并且收获充实饱满的学习生涯。
But we will still make sure that students get the certificates they need and reap the rewards of a full academic career.
Now I know that these steps will not be easy for parents or teachers. And for many parents, this will be frustrating, and it will make it harder for them to go out to work.我很清楚这些步骤对于家长和教师们而言并不轻松。
Now I know that those steps will not be easy for parents and teachers. And for many parents, this will be fresh, and it will make it hard for them to go out to work.
而对于大部分的家长来说，由于这些措施会让他们出门上班变得更加艰难，因此也不免有些令人沮丧。
And for most parents, it's frustrating because it makes it harder for them to get out to work.
And of course that is one of the reasons we haven’t wanted to go ahead and that’s why we are working now on further measures to ensure that we support not just businesses but also individuals and their families to keep our economy going as Rishi Sunak the Chancellor outlined yesterday.当然，也是因为这样，我们才没有采取更多的措施，并且我们也正在找寻更深入的手段用以保障企业、个人和家庭。
Of course, that is why we are not doing more, and why we are looking for more in-depth means to protect businesses, individuals and families. And, of course, it is because of that that we are not doing more to protect businesses, individuals and families.
这样，我们的经济就会同昨天财政大臣里希·苏纳克所描绘的那样继续保持运转。
In this way, our economy will continue to function as described yesterday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sonak.
I also need to remind parents that, as we have already advised, children should not be left with older grandparents, or older relatives, who may be particularly vulnerable or fall into some of the vulnerable groups and I know that will be difficult too. And I want to thank families for their sacrifice at this difficult time. I want to thank whole country for the efforts people are making to comply with these measures.我还需要提醒各位家长，一直以来我们都这么建议，不要把孩子们交给孩子的祖父母，或者是家里老一辈的亲属，他们对于此次病毒而言属于高危人群，当然我也知道这是很难办到的。
I also need to remind parents that we have always advised that children should not be left to their grandparents or to this older generation, or older relatives, who are at high risk for the virus.
我在此感谢所有在眼下的困难时期做出牺牲的家庭们。
I thank all the families who have sacrificed in these difficult times.
我同样也感谢这个国家的人民，为了我们采取的防疫措施所作出的所有努力。
I am equally grateful to the people of that country for all the efforts they have made for the preventive measures we have taken.
I particularly want to thank the teachers, head teachers and all the support staff who keep schools going who will make these exceptional arrangements work, for the benefit of us all.我想要特别感谢的是教师们，校长们和支援学校运行的工作者们，是你们为了我们所有人的利益，作出了这些非常时期的特殊安排。
I am particularly grateful to the teachers, principals and those who support the operation of the school, who have made these extraordinary arrangements for the benefit of all of us.
By looking after the children of key workers they will be a critical part of our fightback against Coronavirus. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.照料关键性工作人员的孩子们的举措，将会成为新冠病毒反击战的决胜部分。
By looking after the children of key workers who will be a critical part of our fight against Coronavius. As I have said, we will take the right steps at the right time, guided by the science.
就像我所说明的，我们将会在科学的指引下，在最正确的时机，采取最正确的措施。
As I said, we will take the most correct measures at the right time and under the guidance of science.
We believe the steps we have already taken, together with those I am announcing today, are already slowing the spread of the disease.因此我坚信我们已经采取的手段，以及今天我所宣布的即将施行的措施，正为我们阻拦病毒的传播起着良好的作用。
We believe the steps we have already made, together with those I am planning today, are alreadyslow the spread of the disease. So I firmly believe that the means we have already taken, and the measures I have announced today, are working well to stop the spread of the virus.
But we will not hesitate to go further, and faster, in the days and weeks ahead.但是我们仍不会满足于此，我们会在接下来的数周内，变得更深入，更迅捷。
But we will not wait till go further, and master, in the days and weeks ahead. But we will not be satisfied. We will get deeper and faster in the coming weeks.
And we will do whatever it takes to so that we beat it together.并且我们会不惜一切代价，共同地将疫情击溃。
And we will do whatever it takes to defeat the epidemic together.
