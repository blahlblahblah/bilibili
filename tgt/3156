口述黄晓民采访张瑾联系到黄晓民时，已是 2 月 2 日晚上 8 点多，他刚协调完一批送给医院的物资回到家中。
When Huang Xiaomin interviewed Zhang Jin, it was more than 8 pm on February 2. He had just coordinated a batch of materials for the hospital and returned home.
电话那头传来咳嗽声。
There was a cough at the end of the phone.
黄晓民，38 岁，南国地产的一名市场推广。
Huang Xiaomin, 38, is a marketing professional in South China Real Estate.
1 月 23 日成立武汉 123 志愿者车队，24 日开始接送医护上下班， 28 日由于志愿者团队缺乏防护物资，存在安全隐患，他决定中止这项行动。
Wuhan 123 volunteers set up on January 23, 24 began to transport medical and transport to and from work, 28, because of the lack of protective materials, security concerns, he decided to suspend the operation.
11 天里，他组建了 5 个微信志愿者群（因防护装备不足解散了 3 个），召集了 174 位司机，接送 200 余位医护人员上下班。
Over the course of 11 days, he formed five small volunteer groups (three were disbanded because of inadequate protective equipment) and assembled 174 drivers to transport more than 200 medical personnel to and from work.
中止行动后，他并没有宅在家中，仍旧奔波在外，为医院、志愿者筹集各类物资。
After the suspension, he did not stay at home, still running outside, for hospitals, volunteers to raise a variety of materials.
11 天里，黄晓民和朋友们见证了许多的恐惧和勇气，他们也害怕，但想要证明一点：武汉人不是大家说的全部都是逃兵。
For 11 days, Huang and his friends witnessed a lot of fear and courage, and they were afraid, but wanted to prove one thing: Wuhan people are not all deserters as everyone says.
采访过程中，一直能听到隐隐约约的咳嗽声，黄晓民说没事，开玩笑称自己是最大的「毒源」。
During the interview, there was a faint cough, and Huang Xiaomin said nothing, joking that he was the biggest "poison source."
以下是他的自述：从南国中心到我家，会路过 4 家医院，晚上加完班回家我就经常看到有一些医护人员下夜班后拦车挺困难的，当时我想其实我可以顺一脚。
From the South China Center to my home, I would pass four hospitals. When I come home from night shift, I often see some of the medical workers having difficulty stopping after night shift.
去年 12 月份的时候，陆陆续续听到一些消息：有人得肺炎了、华南海鲜市场有问题，但当时没当回事，因为政府出来说，这个病不会人传人。
Last December, word trickled in that someone had pneumonia and there was a problem with the South China seafood market, but it wasn't taken seriously because the government said there was no human-to-human transmission of the disease.
今年 1 月份，（消息）越传越多，我就开始警惕了。
In January, as word spread, I became wary.
2003 年非典的时候，我在上大学：中南财经政法大学，当时武汉虽然不是疫区，但我们通过新闻，也知道很多非典幸存者是很痛苦的，当时传这个肺炎和 SARS 有点像，我估计也是那种「哪怕治好了，也要丢半条命」的病，就开始做防护了，但也没太在意。
While Wuhan was not an epidemic area at that time, we also know from the news that many SARS survivors are very painful. At that time, the spread of this pneumonia and SARS was a bit like SARS.
18 号的时候，我们一个大家族 12 个人聚在一起，在我工作的地方——南国中心吃了年夜饭，现在想想真的有点后怕。
On the 18th, 12 members of our extended family got together and ate dinner in the center of Nanguo, where I worked. Now I feel a little scared.
那天，百步亭社区还举办了万人宴。
On that day, a mass banquet was held in the Baebuting community.
唉！虽然消息不畅通，但是民间还是很有方法打听的，消息是封不掉的。
Alas, although the news is not unimpeded, but the folk still have the method to inquire, the news is sealed.
1 月 20 号，我在网上看到有一个来过武汉的阿婆死了，我开始慌了，立马跟我的家人、同事讲，要戴口罩。
January 20, I saw on the Internet a woman who had been to Wuhan died, I began to panic, and immediately told my family, colleagues to wear a mask.
但是戴的人不多，在我上班的商场里都没几个人戴。
But not many people wear them. Not many people wear them in the mall where I work.
所以 1 月 21 号，我就戴着防毒面具自拍了一张发了个朋友圈，那个防毒面具是我打麻将戴的。
So on January 21st, I wore a gas mask, which I wore as a mahjong player, and made myself a friend.
我平时从来不抽烟，也不能闻，闻到就很难受，哥们打麻将喜欢抽烟，我就戴个这个，他们还笑我：怕死。
I never smoke, nor can smell, smell very uncomfortable, friends like to smoke Mahjong, I wear this, they laugh at me: fear of death.
我是真的很怕死。
I'm really scared to death.
1 月 23 号凌晨，武汉宣布封城，城内公交停运，我很快想到他们（医护人员）要怎么上班？当天晚上就建了一个「武汉医生出行互助群」，找来同事、同学还有乙方合作伙伴一起做司机志愿者。
In the early morning of January 23, Wuhan announced the closure of the city, the city's public transportation, I quickly thought of how they (medical staff) to work? That night built a "Wuhan doctor travel mutual help group," found colleagues, classmates and B partners to work as a driver volunteers.
朋友圈一发，当天晚上就有很多人扫码进来了。
Once in a circle of friends, a lot of people came in that night.
现在想想，这大概是我做过的最成功的一个拉人头的宣传吧？其实，那天我也想离开武汉，高速还没有全封，我来得及走。
Now think about it, this is probably the most successful publicity I have ever done to pull the head? In fact, that day I also want to leave Wuhan, the high-speed has not been closed, I have time to walk.
但家里就我一个壮丁，外婆 93 岁了，小姨 62 岁了，爸妈 64 岁了，表弟之类的都不在武汉，万一老人们有个什么事，我该怎么办？所以我一早就把父母接到我家来了。
But I am a strong man, grandmother 93 years old, auntie 62 years old, parents 64, cousins are not in Wuhan, in case there is something old people, what should I do? So I brought my parents to my home early.
随着越来越多热心志愿者的加入，123 志愿车队已经有 100 多个司机，从 1 月 24 号到 28 号，我们每天接送约 200 名医护上下班。
With the addition of more enthusiastic volunteers, the 123 Volunteer Corps has more than 100 drivers. From January 24 to 28, we take about 200 people to and from work every day.
但现在已经不送了，不能再送了。
But now it's gone. It can't be delivered anymore.
武汉的情况越来越严重了，我担不起这个责任。
The situation in Wuhan is getting worse and worse. I can't bear the responsibility.
取名「123 车队」是因为封城的日期，也因为「1、2、3」像一个开始行动的信号，反应速度快，后来我发现和武汉话的「管得宽」挺谐音。
"Team 123" was named because of the date of the city closure and because "1, 2 and 3" was like a signal to start moving, and I found the "tube wide" in Wuhan dialect to be harmonious.
有的时候，我们这些人，管得是挺多的。
There are times when we, the rest of us, have a lot at stake.
23 号当天夜里我就接了一单，一开始没有帽子和护目镜，我戴上泳帽泳镜就上阵了，没想那么多。
On the night of the 23rd I picked up a ticket without a hat and goggles at first. I put on my swimming-cap goggles and didn't think much about it.
后来，坐我车的医护人员跟我说，你这个防护措施不行啊，会有问题的。
Later, the paramedics in my car told me that you can't take this precaution. It's going to be a problem.
一个年轻护士送了我防溅面罩，志愿者给我们送来隔离服、口罩，还有一间小便利店，他们进到了 84 消毒液的货，专门为我们留了两箱。
A young nurse gave me a splash mask, volunteers brought us quarantine suits, masks, and a small convenience store. They brought in disinfectant 84 and reserved two boxes for us.
我们的装备渐渐齐全。
Our equipment is gradually becoming complete.
一位 62 岁被返聘的老医生告诉我，在我们车队接送之前，他要骑两小时一刻钟的自行车上班。
A 62-year-old doctor who had been rehired told me that he had to ride his bike to work for two hours and a quarter of an hour before our motorcade picked it up.
我太太在封城前，就带着 1 岁多的女儿回黄石老家过年。
My wife took her 1-year-old daughter back to her hometown of Huang Shi to celebrate the New Year.
我 23 号发微信告诉她想要做车队，她先是沉默了几分钟，然后我就给她讲了很多医护人员的状况：工作了一夜还要等班车，而且大医院才有班车，社区卫生服务中心没有……，他们有的要走两三个小时才能回家。
After a few minutes of silence on my 23rd letter telling her she wanted to be a motorcade, I told her about the health care workers who had to wait for the bus overnight and the big hospital had a bus.
后来她就给我回：你去吧。
"Then she gave me back," Go ahead.
我也不能去一线治病，也不能去工地建医院，所以我就想做一点小事：开车。
I couldn't go to the frontline, I couldn't go to the construction site to build a hospital, so I wanted to do a little thing: drive.
有些司机是瞒着太太出来的，我的同学让我发朋友圈千万不要提到他，他是跟太太说是出来打麻将的、去钓鱼的，麻将搭子都很健康，戴着 N95 口罩。
Some drivers came out without telling their wives. My classmates told me not to mention him. He told his wife that he was going out to play Mahjong, go fishing, mahjong is very healthy, wearing N95 mask.
开车的时候，我都开一半窗户，因为我记得非典那个时候就说要勤通风、勤通风，所以我每天开车都把窗户打开，武汉这几天还是挺冷的。
When driving, I open half the window, because I remember when SARS said frequent ventilation, ventilation, so I drive every day to open the window, Wuhan is still quite cold these days.
我的咳嗽可能就是吹风感冒的，我希望是。
My cough might have been a cold. I hope so.
差不多第三单的样子，我接了武汉市中心医院后湖院区的两个护士，她们两个都是 95 后。
About the third appearance, I took Wuhan central hospital back lake courtyard area two nurses, they are both 95.
其中一个护士跟我说，确诊的第一例就在她的病区，床号 27，她还护理过好几次。
One of the nurses told me that the first confirmed case was in her area, bed number 27, and she had nursed her several times.
我问她怕不怕？她说当然怕啊。
I asked her if she was afraid? Of course she was.
然后我们就沉默了，不知道该说点什么。
Then we were silent, not knowing what to say.
医护人员真的很累也很不容易。
The paramedics are really tired and it's not easy.
有一天早上 7 点钟，我接一个护士下班，她上车直接就倒在后坐睡着了，幸好我知道她住在哪。
One morning at 7 a.m., I picked up a nurse from work and she got on the bus and fell asleep in the back seat. Fortunately I knew where she lived.
开车的我就在想，这是有多累？能在一个陌生的男人车上放心地睡觉？感觉很心酸……回去后，我就在司机群里公布了一条规定：所有司机必须把三证（身份证、驾驶证、行驶证）一单（保险单）拍给我，否则踢群。
I just thought, how tired is it to sleep peacefully in a strange man's car? It hurts... and when I get back, I announce a rule among drivers: All drivers have to shoot me three cards (ID card, driver's license, travel permit) or kick the crowd.
这也是我能为医护人员做的一点小事了。
That's the little thing I can do for the paramedics.
一位医生请我们去接他的父亲，因为他和父亲要去不同的医院服务，他没法照顾到父亲上班。
A doctor asked us to pick up his father because he and his father had to go to different hospitals and he couldn't take care of his father.
一位年轻的协和医院护士，她也不是属于呼吸科感染科，但她说等火神山、雷神山医院建好，她要主动请缨过去前线。
A young Concorde hospital nurse, she was not part of the respiratory department, but said she would volunteer to go to the front when Mount Fire and Raytheon Mountain Hospital were built.
很多医生护士下车的时候，直接丢下 100 块现金，或者微信上发红包，我们都是不收的，有时候我还会倒给她们红包。
Many doctors and nurses get out of their car and drop a hundred dollars in cash or a red envelope. We don't charge for them, and sometimes I give them red envelopes.
让他们加油。
Let them refuel.
为了防护，我们要求医护和司机尽量少交谈，而且大家都是陌生人，车上总是很安静。
As a precaution, we asked the doctor and the driver to talk as little as possible, and everyone was a stranger and the car was always quiet.
我等红灯的时候会跟他们讲一下话。
I'll talk to them when I'm waiting for a red light.
我问过一个护士等疫情过去，她最想干嘛？她说想好好喝口水，再睡 48 个小时。
I asked a nurse what she wanted to do with the outbreak, and she said she wanted a good drink and 48 hours of sleep.
因为他们总是穿着防护服，物资紧缺，一天不敢喝水。
Because they always wear protective clothing, supplies are scarce, dare not drink water for a day.
除了接送医护人员，我作为志愿者车队的队长，还会想方设法地去筹集物资、送到医院、发给志愿者。
In addition to transporting medical staff, as the captain of the volunteer team, I would try to raise supplies, send them to hospitals, and give them to volunteers.
所以我家就像一个运输中转站一样，有很多东西，经常也有人到我们家来拿东西。
So my home is like a transit station, there are a lot of things, often people come to our home to pick up things.
每个人戴着口罩，互相也不认得，大家都很少话但动作迅速。
Everyone wore masks and did not recognize each other. Everybody spoke little but acted quickly.
25 号那天，我去武汉市中心医院后湖院区送物资，我搞到一些酒精，就想着送过去帮他们一下。
On the 25th, I went to the backlake courtyard of Wuhan city central hospital to deliver supplies. I got some alcohol and thought of sending it to help them.
急诊台前站了七八个护士，我说「你好，我是志愿者黄晓民，我来捐两箱酒精。
There were seven or eight nurses standing in front of the emergency desk. I said, "Hi, I'm Huang Xiaomin, I'm donating two cases of alcohol.
」接待我的护士有点懵，跟我说「你等一下，我去找一下我们护士长。
The nurse who received me was stunned and said, "Wait a minute. I'll go find our head nurse.
」我就站在急诊室里，无数的病人在我周围。
"I was standing in the emergency room, surrounded by countless patients.
左边，一位护士安抚一位高度疑似感染者，没有检测盒没法确诊。
On the left, a nurse soothes a highly suspected infected person who cannot be diagnosed without a test box.
护士安慰他「你冷静一点」，他用武汉话大喊「老子怎么冷静？」，右边是等着看病的人在排队。
The nurse comforted him by saying, "Calm down," he shouted in Wuhan, "How calm is Lao Tzu?" and on the right was the waiting list.
地上也坐了很多人，因为市内的交通停了，很多人来医院都要走一两个小时，急诊室又没有那么多的凳子，他们站不住，只能坐在地上。
There were many people on the ground, too, because the city's traffic stopped, many people had to walk for an hour or two to the hospital, and there were not so many stools in the emergency room.
那一瞬间，我真的觉得可怜又渺小，我什么也做不了，我只能开车。
At that moment, I really feel poor and small, I can do nothing but drive.
我没等护士长来，我把酒精放在急诊台上就走了。
I didn't wait for the head nurse. I put the alcohol on the emergency table and left.
在那样的环境里，我待不住，我得走。
In an environment like that, I can't stay. I have to go.
最长的一天，我戴了 6 个小时手套没有换，穿了 13 个小时的防护服。
The longest day, I wore six hours of gloves and 13 hours of protective clothing.
来回大概 11 趟，送了大概 20 多个医护人员。
About 11 trips back and forth, delivering about 20 paramedics.
武汉大，真的太大了。
Wuhan is big, really too big.
这个时候，就希望自己的城市小一点。
At this time, I want my city to be smaller.
我最近微信里多了 1200 多个人，绝大部分都不认识，但是大家真的都很热心，就是有一种什么感觉呢？病毒在这个月内疯狂地缩小包围圈，把我们圈住了。
I've had more than 1,200 people in my recent micro-letters, most of whom I don't know, but everyone is really zealous, but what's the feeling? The virus has been frantically shutting down the envelope and encircling us this month.
27 号有一个单，是要从武汉第八医院去江夏区，全程 30 公里，刚看到我还担心这个单没人接，但很快就有司机说：没人去，我去！24 号，群里开始接送的时候，我就在群里跟司机说了，你们有困难的，我一单补贴你们 20 块钱，但是没人来跟我要这个钱。
There is a single 27, from Wuhan Eighth Hospital to Jiangxia District, the entire journey 30 kilometers, just saw I was still worried about this single no one answered, but soon a driver said: No one, I go! 24, the group began to pick up, I told the driver, you have difficulties, I a subsidy of 20 dollars, but no one asked me for the money.
我们不像滴滴，滴滴司机平台一天补贴 1000 多，我们油钱都是自己掏。
Unlike drip-dripping, drip-drip platforms subsidize more than 1,000 times a day, and we pay for our fuel at our own expense.
合作的设计公司免费为车队设计了队标，后勤志愿者打印好，大家分头去取，贴在车子挡风玻璃下方，交警看到我们的标志，都会放行。
The cooperating design company designed the team logo for the team free of charge. Logistics volunteers printed it out and put it under the windshield of the car. When the traffic police saw our logo, they released it.
中心医院的急诊护士说，有一对新婚夫妻，才装修好的婚房就在中心医院后湖院区附近的小区，他们把新房免费给医护人员住，连一点押金都不肯收，这个事我觉得自己都做不到。
The emergency nurse at the central hospital said there was a newly-wed couple in a small neighborhood near the back-lake courtyard of the central hospital who gave their new house free of charge to paramedics and refused to take a deposit, something I felt I couldn't do.
我作为队长，有的时候，要在群里安慰一些队友的情绪，所以我大部分时候是乐观的。
As captain, sometimes I have to comfort some of my teammates in the group, so I am optimistic most of the time.
但有的时候，我也会崩溃。
But sometimes, I break down.
1 月 28 号是疫情爆发期，武汉新增了 800 例确诊。
January 28 is the outbreak period, Wuhan has a new 800 cases of diagnosis.
其实那天我特别高兴，因为我搞到了 4 箱隔离服，一共 200 件，我想着赶紧送到医院和社区去。
I was really happy that day because I got four boxes of quarantined suits, 200 pieces in all, and I wanted to get to the hospital and the community.
但后来在手机上看到确诊的数字在一个个增加，我心里开始发愁了，我感觉到压力特别大，哭了两次。
But as the number of confirmed cases on my mobile phone grew, I began to worry. I felt particularly stressed and cried twice.
这个 123 车队是我发起的，但我没法为志愿者的生命安全负责，所以我就写一个《告司机朋友书》和《告医护人员书》。
I started this 123 team, but I couldn't take responsibility for the safety of the volunteers, so I wrote a "Letter to the Driver's Friend" and a "Letter to the Medical Staff."
我一个个跟医护人员解释：我们志愿者没有防护措施，所以从 1 月 29 号开始，暂停接单，当我们能获取 EN14126type4 级别以上的防护服和 N95 口罩时，如果城市还需要我们，我们会继续接送医护人员。
I explained to the paramedics one by one that our volunteers had no protective measures, so starting on January 29th, when we were able to get protective clothing and N95 masks above EN 14126 type 4, we would continue to pick up the paramedics if the city needed us.
30 号那天下午，我又搞到 10 箱酒精，液体黄金啊！很兴奋就发了个朋友圈：「见到酒精比见到酒开心」，然后我就收到一条微信，是一个第八医院的医生发给我，我记不得我有没有接送过他了。
On the afternoon of the 30th, I got another ten cases of alcohol, liquid gold! Excited, I had a circle of friends: "It's better to see alcohol than to see it," and then I got a message from a doctor at the 8th Hospital. I can't remember if I picked him up.
「你能送一点酒精给我们八院吗？我们这里物资很缺乏。
"Can you send us some alcohol to our eight hospitals? We're short of supplies here."
」随后，他给我发来了他们科室用文件袋、胶带纸自己做防护面罩的照片，我知道物资缺乏，但我没想到这么缺乏，战士上战场别说没有机关枪和子弹，连矛和盾都没有啊！「我们的物资去哪里了？谁能告诉我？」那一刻，我真的受不了，蹲在地上大哭了一顿，上半身隔离服全湿了。
"Then he sent me pictures of his department making his own face shield with paper bags and tape. I knew there was a shortage of supplies, but I didn't expect it. The soldiers went to war and said they didn't have machine guns or bullets, spears or shields.
最近这段时间，我的心态一直在变化，最开始（23 号晚上）我没想怎么样，我就是想帮助一下那些医护人员，我很平静。
My mind has been changing these days, and at the beginning (23rd night) I didn't think about it. I just wanted to help the paramedics. I was calm.
24 号开始患者人数越来越多，我开始兴奋了，毕竟我的本职工作是做市场推广的，28 号我真的怕了，很为难，我只是一个普通人，没钱没地位没关系。
As the number of patients began to grow on the 24th, I began to get excited. After all, my job was marketing. I was really afraid of the twenty-eighth.
30 号彻底崩溃了，看到我们的物资被红会积压着！现在我又恢复了平静，就想着能做一点是一点吧。
Number 30 broke down completely and saw that our supplies were stacked up by the Red Cross! Now that I've regained my composure, I thought I could do a little bit.
疫情结束之后，我只想开车回黄石，好好抱抱我的女儿，我真的很想她。
After the outbreak, I just wanted to drive back to Yellowstone and hug my daughter. I really miss her.
我还想把这个 123 志愿者群保留着，去帮助残疾人、老人……我没有像大家说的那么伟大、勇敢，我就是想证明一点：武汉人不是大家说的全部都是逃兵，往外面逃跑的传染源，空投到世界各地；还有很多像我们一样连武器都没有的战士在拼命作战。
I also want to keep this 123 volunteers to help the disabled, the elderly... I do not as great and brave as everyone said, I just want to prove that Wuhan people are not all deserters, outside the source of infection, airdropped around the world; there are many like us who do not even have weapons in the fight.
