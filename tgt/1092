不管是专家院士还是临床医生，对一个疾病的认知都有个过程黄朝林。
Whether an expert academician or a clinician, there is a process of recognition of a disease known as Huang Chaolin.
图/中新网1月19日凌晨，武汉市卫健委举行新闻发布会，针对武汉市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎综合防控答记者问。
Photo / Xinhua In the early morning hours of January 19, Wuhan city health committee held a press conference, Wuhan against the new coronavirus infection of the comprehensive control of pneumonia.
当时，湖北省医疗组专家、武汉市金银潭医院副院长、主任医师黄朝林作为专家出席发布会并答记者问。
At that time, Hubei province medical team expert, Wuhan City gold and silver pool hospital vice-president, chief physician Huang Chaolin attended the press conference as an expert and answered questions.
三天后，22日，他自己的新型冠状病毒核酸检测结果显示为阳性——黄朝林也确诊感染了。
Three days later, on the 22nd, he tested positive for his own coronavirus nucleic acid, and Huang Chaolin was diagnosed with the infection.
如今，已痊愈的黄朝林仍在家中隔离，领导要求他以休息为主，不过他却闲不住。
Now, the recovered Huang Chaolin is still isolated in his home. The leader demands rest, but he cannot help it.
2月13日，据湖北省卫健委发布的疫情通报，该省一下子增加了1万多名确诊患者。
On February 13, more than 10,000 patients were diagnosed in Hubei province, according to an epidemic notice issued by the Hubei Provincial Health Commission.
官方解释称，“从今天起，湖北省将临床诊断病例数纳入确诊病例数进行公布。
"From today, Hubei Province will include the number of clinical diagnosis cases in the number of confirmed cases," the official explanation said.
”黄朝林给《中国新闻周刊》发来这条消息，并加了一句话：“临床诊断病例＝疑似病例+影像学检查。
Huang sent the news to China News Weekly, adding: "Clinical diagnosis = suspected case + imaging examination.
不再需要核酸检测！”一个医生的“战疫”从2019年12月29日接到武汉市卫健委的电话开始，黄朝林的“战疫”就已经打响了。
No more nucleic acid testing! "A doctor's" plague "began December 29, 2019, when he received a call from the Wuhan Health Commission, and Huang Chaolin's" epidemic "began.
作为湖北省与武汉市突发公共卫生事件医疗救治定点医院，金银潭医院是当地第一家新冠肺炎患者定点收治医院。
As a designated hospital for medical treatment of public health emergencies in Hubei Province and Wuhan, Gold and Silver Pool Hospital is the first local hospital for patients with Newcastle Pneumonia.
29日是星期日，黄朝林上午在医院病房转了一圈，下午回家休息。
It was Sunday. Huang Chaolin took a walk around the hospital ward in the morning and went home to rest in the afternoon.
到家不到两个小时，就接到武汉市卫健委的电话，要求他赶到湖北省中西医结合医院去排查可疑病例。
Less than two hours home, Wuhan Health Commission received a phone call, asked him to Hubei Province combined with traditional Chinese and Western medicine to detect suspicious cases.
据《长江日报》报道，当时，黄朝林与他们医院的ICU主任吴文娟戴上N95口罩，穿了件普通工作服就去了湖北省中西医结合医院。
At the time, Huang and his hospital's ICU director, Wu Wenjuan, put on N95 masks and put on a normal work uniform before going to Hubei Provincial Chinese and Western Medical Association Hospital, Changjiang Daily reported.
7个可疑病人已被安排在该院呼吸科相对独立的区域进行了隔离，院呼吸与重症医学科张继先主任给他们介绍了这7个病人的收治情况，带他们一一查看病人。
Seven suspected patients have been quarantined in a relatively independent area of the hospital's respiratory department. Zhang Jixian, the hospital's breathing and severe medicine department, introduced them to the seven patients and showed them each one.
大家分析讨论一番后，黄朝林认为，这些病人可能具有传染性，在综合医院对其他病人不安全，需要转到专门收治传染病人的金银潭医院。
After some analysis and discussion, Huang felt that these patients might be contagious and unsafe for other patients in the general hospital and needed to be referred to the gold and silver pool hospital for patients with infectious diseases.
黄朝林用电话向金银潭医院院长张定宇与武汉市卫健委做了汇报，调来了负压救护车，并让负责接收的医护人员穿好三级防护服。
Huang told Zhang Dingyu, director of the gold and silver pool hospital, and Wuhan city health committee to make a report, transferred a negative pressure ambulance, and let the medical staff responsible for receiving wear tertiary protective clothing.
除一位不愿去金银潭医院的轻症病人外，6位病人的转运从傍晚持续到晚上11点多。
With the exception of one minor patient who did not wish to go to the Gold and Silver Pool Hospital, the transport of six patients lasted from dusk to more than 11 pm.
黄朝林告诉《中国新闻周刊》，在他的印象里，大约从1月6日开始，金银潭医院接收到越来越多的“不明原因肺炎”病人。
Huang told China News Weekly that he was under the impression that since about January 6, more and more patients with "unexplained pneumonia" had been admitted to the gold and silver pool hospital.
而黄朝林对这些患者的流行病学调查，从12月29日当天夜里就开始了。
The epidemiological investigation of these patients by Huang Chaolin began on the night of December 29.
1月25日，黄朝林与同事对最初感染的41例确诊病例进行的回顾性分析，论文发表在《柳叶刀》杂志上。
On January 25, Huang and colleagues carried out a retrospective analysis of 41 confirmed cases of initial infection, published in The Lancet.
该论文分析的41例病例中，有14例没有华南海鲜市场接触史，但仍被感染。
Of the 41 cases analysed in the paper, 14 had no history of exposure to the South China seafood market, but were still infected.
对此，黄朝林推测有两个原因：“第一个就是新冠病毒的暴露源可能不只是华南海鲜市场，可能有多源性的感染；第二个是可能存在人际间的传播，即从华南海鲜市场感染的病人通过其他途径，感染了无华南海鲜市场接触史的其他患者。
"The first is that the source of exposure to the new cap virus may not be just the South China seafood market, it may have multiple sources of infection. The second is possible interpersonal transmission, in which patients infected from the South China seafood market infect other patients with a history of exposure to the South China seafood market through other means.
虽然这部分患者没有暴露在华南海鲜市场，但也可能因人际间传播感染。
Although this group of patients is not exposed to the South China seafood market, it may also be due to human-to-human transmission.
”在自己患病之前的25天里，黄朝林除了要给患者看病、做科研，他还有另外一个重要工作，就是要接待来自省、市与国家三个级别卫健委的多个专家组。
"In the 25 days before his illness, in addition to treating patients and doing scientific research, Huang had another important job of hosting expert groups from provincial, municipal and national health committees.
截至1月20日，先后就有国家卫健委的三批专家组抵汉调查。
As of January 20, three groups of experts from the National Health Commission have arrived in China to investigate.
疫情初期还没有病毒核酸检测。
Viral nucleic acid testing was not available at the beginning of the outbreak.
李兴旺、曹彬等国家卫健委第一批专家组与湖北省市卫健委一起制定了早期的诊断标准。
Li Xing, Cao Bin and other national health committee of the first group of experts and Hubei City Health Commission together with the early diagnosis criteria.
当时，患者需要同时具备有华南海鲜市场接触史，发热、缺氧、呼吸困难等临床症状与CT影像学等条件，才能被确诊为新冠肺炎。
At that time, patients need to have a history of contact with the South China seafood market, fever, hypoxia, dyspnea and other clinical conditions and CT imaging conditions, can be diagnosed as New Crown Pneumonia.
对此，黄朝林说，“据我所知，诊断标准一共做了5次修改，五版诊疗方案。
"To my knowledge, the diagnostic criteria have been revised five times," Huang said.
不管是专家院士，还是临床医生，对于一个疾病的认知都有个过程。
Whether an expert academician or a clinician, there is a process of understanding a disease.
初期的诊断标准是根据当时的认知能力和认知水平制定的，后来随着病例增多和对病情的了解加深，诊断标准和治疗方案也在慢慢地完善，这应该是可以理解的。
The initial diagnostic criteria were based on the cognitive and cognitive level of the time, and it should be understandable that diagnostic criteria and treatment programmes are slowly being refined as the number of cases increases and the understanding of the condition increases.
”此前，金银潭医院院长张定宇也告诉《中国新闻周刊》，“疫情初期，在正式的多版诊疗方案出台之前，有关部门做过一个诊疗指南，供内部使用。
Zhang Dingyu, director of the Golden and Silver Pool Hospital, also told China News Weekly: "In the early stages of the outbreak, before the official multi-edition protocol was launched, authorities had done a clinical guide for internal use.
当时，我们强调流行病学史比较多，不像现在，没有华南海鲜市场接触史的病人更多一些。
At the time, we emphasized the history of epidemiology, unlike today, there is no South China seafood market contact history more patients.
当时专家都把华南海鲜市场接触史作为流行病学意义上很重要的依据，同时也作为诊断的要求和条件。
Experts at that time regarded the history of seafood market exposure in South China as an important basis in epidemiology and as a requirement and condition for diagnosis.
这不是某一个专家的意见，而是大家的一个共识，整体的专家意见是由国家和省、市的专家一起制定的。
This is not the opinion of a single expert, but rather a consensus, as the overall expertise is developed by experts at the national and provincial and municipal levels.
这跟事件本身发展的认知水平有一定的关系。
This has something to do with the level of awareness of the event itself.
”武汉金银潭医院。
Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
本刊记者/彭丹妮 摄除了接待专家组、做科研之外，随着疫情发展，越来越多的病人需要诊疗，外地前来支援的医务人员也需要交接安置。
In addition to receiving expert group and doing scientific research, more and more patients need medical treatment as the epidemic progresses, and medical staff from other places will need to be handed over and rehoused.
这些都是作为业务副院长的黄朝林的工作，当时，他每天最多只有四个小时的睡眠时间。
These were the jobs of Huang Chaolin, the vice-dean of operations, who had at most four hours of sleep a day.
过于疲劳让他的免疫力下降。
Too much fatigue has weakened his immunity.
这样的工作状态似乎也能在他的微信中得到印证：黄朝林的微信头像和朋友圈封面都是在医院拍摄的，个性签名则是“踏实做人，认真做事。
Such work seems to be confirmed in his message: the head of Huang Chaolin and the cover of his circle of friends were taken in the hospital, and his signature was "a down-to-earth man doing things conscientiously."
”一个病人的“战疫”黄朝林回忆说，从1月17日开始，他就感到身体很不舒服，开始干咳。
Huang Chaolin, a patient with the disease, recalled that from January 17 he began to feel sick and began to cough dry.
一开始，他还误以为这是此前就有的普通感冒造成的，直到确诊后，才意识到这是感染的早期表现。
At first, he mistakenly thought it was a common cold that had been around until he was diagnosed and realized it was an early sign of infection.
回想自己的感染原因，黄朝林想到了1月10日晚，在他换下防护服、摘下口罩，从门诊回办公室的过程中，一位病人的女儿和女婿认出了他，直接跑到他面前跪下。
Looking back at the cause of his infection, Huang thought of the night of Jan. 10, when he changed his suit, took off his mask and went back to his office from the outpatient clinic.
黄朝林赶紧把两个人扶起来，并询问了病人的情况。
Huang Zhaolin quickly helped the two men up and asked about the patient.
在交流过程中，夫妻俩一人拉着黄朝林的一只手，且三人均未戴口罩。
During the conversation, the couple grabbed one of Huang Chaolin's hands, all of them wearing masks.
三天后，这对夫妇也确诊了新冠肺炎。
Three days later, the couple was also diagnosed with pneumonia.
在黄朝林印象中，这是他唯一可能暴露的机会。
In Huang Chaolin's impression, this is his only possible exposure.
黄朝林是22日下午五点左右做的病毒核酸检测，晚上9点出的结果，显示为阳性。
Huang Chaolin 22 around 5 p.m. did the virus nucleic acid test, 9 pm results, showed a positive.
他在晚上10点左右又去查了肺部CT，结果为双肺出现较轻阴影，已有磨玻璃样病灶。
He went to the lung CT around 10 p. m., the result is a lighter shadow of the lungs, there is a ground glass-like focus.
处理完手头的工作，已是23日凌晨3点，黄朝林靠在办公室的沙发上休息，此时他已经出现了畏寒、发热的症状。
By 3 a.m. on the 23rd, Huang Chaolin was resting against the sofa in his office when he had developed symptoms of chills and fever.
23日，黄朝林脱下防护服，住进了医院的隔离病房，从医生变为了病人。
On February 23, Huang took off his protective clothing and was admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital, changing from doctor to patient.
入院时，他的氧饱和度不到93，属于重症病人。
At the time of admission, his oxygen saturation was less than 93 and he was in a critical condition.
也是同一天，他在参加克力芝试药的临床观察知情同意书上签下自己的名字，以身试药，成为了380名“试药人”中的一员，他要通过自己的治疗，来验证治疗HIV病毒的克力芝治疗新冠肺炎的临床疗效和安全性。
On the same day, he signed his name on the Closely Observed Informed Consent (PIC) for the Kaletra trial and became one of 380 "trial drug users" to validate the clinical efficacy and safety of Kaletra in treating new crown pneumonia with HIV through his own treatment.
住院后的前十几天里，治疗并不顺利，“有发热、缺氧的表现，有时感觉肺要咳出来了。
After hospitalization for the first ten days, the treatment is not smooth, "there is fever, hypoxia performance, sometimes feel lung cough out.
”黄朝林也出现了肺部损伤和呼吸困难的症状。
Huang Chaolin also showed signs of lung damage and breathing difficulties.
在不吸氧的情况下，他的氧饱和度一度最低只有80左右。
In the absence of oxygen, his oxygen saturation at one point was only about 80.
还出现了克力芝的副作用：腹泻、恶心、呕吐等胃肠道反应。
There are also the side effects of Kaletra: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal reactions.
但黄朝林说，“可以耐受。
But Mr. Huang said, 'It's tolerable.
”这样的过程持续了十几天。
The process lasted for a dozen days.
除了克力芝，这段时间里，中日友好医院副院长曹彬教授与武汉同济医院宋建新教授等专家还对他进行了激素治疗和鼻导管给氧、肺部通气等综合治疗和支持。
In addition to Kaletra, the Vice-President of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, Professor Cao Bin, and Professor Song Jianxin, Wuhan Tongji Hospital, and other experts provided him with hormone therapy and comprehensive treatment and support for oxygen and pulmonary ventilation through nasal catheters.
“确诊两周后，我的病情开始慢慢地好转。
"Two weeks after my diagnosis, my condition began to improve slowly.
”直到2月4日，病情才稳住。
It was not until February 4 that the illness was stabilized.
黄朝林说，“我是在2月2号进行的病后第一次核酸检测，结果为阴性。
"I tested negative for my first nucleic acid test on February 2," Huang said.
间隔48小时后，也就是2月4号，我进行了第二次核酸检测，结果同样显示阴性，符合出院标准。
Forty-eight hours later, on February 4, I underwent a second nucleic acid test, which also showed negative results and met the criteria for discharge.
之后就出院了，现在在家隔离。
He was discharged from the hospital and is now isolated at home.
”在采访过程中，记者听到黄朝林仍偶有咳嗽。
During the interview, reporters heard that Huang still coughed occasionally.
他解释说，“这是一种刺激性咳嗽。
"It's an irritating cough," he explains.
已出院的病人会在不同程度上出现这种刺激性咳嗽甚至气喘的情况，彻底恢复的话还需要时间，但不会对正常生活造成很大影响。
Patients who have been discharged from hospital will suffer from this irritating cough and even asthma to varying degrees. It will take time to recover completely, but it will not affect normal life very much.
”他还解释说，免疫力下降是他病情较为严重的主要原因，但多数新冠肺炎患者还是以轻症为主。
He also explained that the decline in immunity was the main cause of his illness, but that the majority of new cases of pneumonia were mild.
黄朝林说，“目前疫情形势比较紧迫，我作为专家和副院长，应该尽快回到工作岗位。
"The current situation is urgent," Huang said. "As an expert and vice-dean, I should get back to work as soon as possible.
