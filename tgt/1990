图片来自微博虽然流程上有所简化，但企业仍然面临两难的问题，如果审批相对宽松，虽然复工复产进程也要相对较快，但防疫的安全隐患也增大了，如果审批过于严格，又会拉长企业的复工复产速度。
Although the process of microblogging has been simplified, enterprises still face a dilemma, if the approval is relatively easy, although the resumption of work is relatively fast, but the security risks of epidemic prevention have increased, if too strict, will also lengthen the resumption of enterprises.
