燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 魏佳如果把2015年作为无人驾驶的元年，五年之后，行业该交作业了。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former founder and founder of Suqi Editing & # 45; & # 45; If Wei Jia uses 2015 as the first year of unmanned aerial vehicle service, five years from now the industry should hand in its homework.
整个无人驾驶行业是一个资金密集型、人才密集型、长期煎熬才能迎来破局点的行业。
The entire unmanned industry is a capital-intensive, talent-intensive, long-term suffering to usher in a broken point of the industry.
往前走的过程当中，一定有人慢慢掉队。
Someone must be falling behind as we go along.
驭势科技联合创始人、董事长兼CEO吴甘沙认为，任何一个行业，发展到第五年都会变得非常有紧迫感，疫情会给行业带来一些热度，大的投资事件会带来一些信心，但是本质上，企业想要存活下来，还是要在技术上、商业模式上走通。
'The fifth year of any industry is going to be very urgent, 'says Wu Gansa, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Trench Technologies. The epidemic will bring some heat to the industry, big investment events will bring some confidence, but in essence, companies need to be technically and commercially viable to survive.
3月20日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦于自动驾驶，中科创星创始合伙人、联席CEO米磊，新石器创始人兼CEO余恩源，驭势科技联合创始人、董事长兼CEO吴甘沙进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
On March 20, Flaming Finance hosted an online salon focusing on auto-driving, co-CEO Miele Miele, founder and co-CEO of Founder and CEO of Neolithic Technologies, Shah Gansa, chairman and CEO of Crossing Technologies, and held a dialogue with Ho Shulong, chief financial editor of Fairfax.
吴甘沙表示，科研出身的他创业这几年来，经历了一个不断去除理想化而变得更加现实、更加有敬畏之心、更加尊重客观规律的过程。
Wu Gansha said that his scientific background in the past few years, he has gone through a process of constantly removing idealization and becoming more realistic, more awe-inspiring, and more respectful of objective laws.
这个行业需要不断学习，未来5G浪潮会给行业带来哪些变化？新基建和无人驾驶领域如何擦出火花？他有着自己不一样的理解。
The industry needs to keep learning, how will the next 5G wave change the industry, and how new infrastructure and driverless areas will spark it? He has a different understanding.
以下是吴甘沙的分享：疫情来了公司没有浪费这场“好危机”武汉宣布封城之后，公司就成立了一个应急小组，在客户、员工和公司层面分别做了调整。
After Wuhan announced the closure of the city, the company set up an emergency response team to make adjustments at the customer, employee and company levels.
客户方面，公司觉得与其捐钱捐物资，慷投资人之慨，不如120%地兑现对客户的承诺，帮助他们度过困难。
On the customer side, the company feels that instead of donating money and materials, we should honor our promise to our customers 120% at the expense of our investors.
为此，团队梳理出几类项目。
To this end, the team combed out several types of projects.
第一类是用无人物流车帮助香港机场维持运营。
The first is the use of unmanned logistics vehicles to help maintain Hong Kong's airport.
疫情期间，我们决定让前期已经在香港提供本地运维服务的同学暂时留岗，然后用最快的时间把整个运维工作交接给当地的合作伙伴。
During the outbreak, we decided to leave students who were already providing local operations in Hong Kong temporarily on duty and hand over the whole operation to local partners as soon as possible.
整个疫情期间，香港机场的无人物流车运营没有一天中断过，像往常一样7×16h完成配送工作。
Throughout the epidemic, Hong Kong's airport was operating without a single day of unattended logistics vehicles, delivering 7 x 16 hours of delivery as usual.
第二类是合作伙伴上汽通用五菱车厂春节后复工。
The second kind is the partner SAIC General Wuling car factory after the Spring Festival.
我们的工程师进不去工厂，在厂外在线培训工厂工人操作无人物流，重新启动物流线，这条线路已经运行了好几个月，一条线大概七台车，能省掉八个驾驶员。
Our engineers can't get into the plant, train factory workers off-site to run the unmanned logistics line, which has been running for months, about seven cars, and can save eight drivers.
第三类是跟大客户的量产项目。
The third category is with large customers of mass production projects.
今年在乘用车这块，我们正在准备量产项目。
We're working on a mass production project for the passenger car this year.
为了不耽搁项目， 2月6号就开始复工，但是供应链被卡住，代工生产商那边很迟复工，为了赶进度，员工就自己在实验室里造出了生产线一样的环境，在里面对零部件进行组装、标定、打标等，第一时间发到主机厂客户那边。
In order not to delay the project, work began on 6 February, but the supply chain was jammed and the contract manufacturer was late to get back to work. In order to catch up, the staff built a production line-like environment in the laboratory where the parts were assembled, calibrated, marked and dispatched to the main plant customers at the first time.
丘吉尔说过：“不要浪费一场好危机。
Churchill said, "Don't waste a good crisis.
”我觉得这一次的灾难，就是在要求我们用非常规的方法去完成对客户的承诺。
"I think this time the disaster is asking us to take extraordinary steps to meet our commitments to our customers.
当然，在这当中我们内部自己也倒逼着激发了很多潜能，团队自下而上做了很有趣的创新。
Of course, in the process, we ourselves are pushing for a lot of potential, and the team is making interesting innovations from the bottom up.
我们本身并不做无人配送，疫情期间，合作伙伴第一时间发来无接触配送和无人消毒的需求，我们有两三个工程师很早就回到了办公室，花了一周在合作伙伴的底盘上把这个功能做了出来，为了尽快用起来，员工自己切割、打磨PV板，做出无人车的外壳。
We did not do unattended deliveries ourselves. During the outbreak, partners first sent in untouched deliveries and unsterilized demand, and two or three of our engineers returned to the office early, spent a week on the chassis of our partners to do this, and cut, polish, and make the hull of an unmanned car as quickly as possible.
另外，上汽通用五菱有无人消毒的需求，我们仅花了一两天的时间就对部分无人物流车完成了改装。
In addition, SAIC General Wuling has no need to disinfect, we spent only a day or two to complete the conversion of some unmanned logistics vehicles.
公司层面，我们盘点、加固了自己的现金流，预测最坏的情况，准备最好的情况，尤其是下半年需求的报复性反弹。
At the company level, we took stock, strengthened our cash flow, predicted the worst, and prepared for the best, especially the retaliatory rebound in demand in the second half of the year.
同时对工作计划进行调整，把一些原来计划在下半年做的事情提前。
At the same time, the programme of work was adjusted to bring forward some of the things originally planned for the second half of the year.
新基建与无人化一定会擦出火花此次新冠肺炎被《世界是平的》的作者托马斯·弗里德曼认为是“公元前和公元后”那样的历史分割点，即B.C.（公元前）-Before Corona和A.C.（公元后）-After Corona。
New infrastructure and dehumanization are bound to spark this new crown pneumonia by Thomas Friedman, author of The World Is Flat, a historical divide like B. C. (BC) -Before Corona and A.C. (post-A.C.) -After Corona.
而恩格斯说过，没有哪一次巨大的历史灾难，不是以历史的进步为补偿的。
Engels said that there was no such thing as a great historical disaster, not compensated for by the progress of history.
在这个分割点后，新基建则会是这次疫情的补偿。
At this point, the new infrastructure will compensate for the outbreak.
首先基础设施一定有强外部性，它具备了带动效应、放大效应和乘数效应。
First, there must be strong externalities in the infrastructure, which have a catalytic effect, a amplification effect and a multiplier effect.
就像以前的GPS刚发明出来的时候，大家不知道它那么有用。
Like when GPS was first invented, people didn't know it was that useful.
但事实上，在GPS或者北斗当中投入一块钱，能够给社会带来100块钱的效益。
But the truth is that investing a dollar in GPS or Big Dipper can pay society $100.
其次，中国新四大发明背后就有一些新的基础设施支持，包括移动支付、快捷低成本物流和强大的制造能力等等。
Second, there is some new infrastructure behind China's new four inventions, including mobile payments, fast and low-cost logistics, and strong manufacturing capabilities.
这些新基础设施在未来的数字社会中具有非常重要的地位。
These new infrastructures will play a very important role in the future digital society.
最后，这些基础设施需要满足几个条件，第一是低成本，长期的低成本。
Finally, these infrastructures need to meet several conditions, the first of which is low cost, long-term low cost.
它要跟CPI，也就是物价上涨脱钩。
It has to decouple from the CPI, or rising prices.
第二是这些新基础设施需要具备反脆弱性，不能轻易地被灾难破坏，在任何情况下都要不间断工作。
The second is that these new infrastructures need to be resilient, not easily destroyed by disasters and, in any case, uninterrupted.
第三是高效率、易管理。
The third is efficient and easy to manage.
综上，我认为新基础设施应该是建立在非人力参与的基础上的，因此新基建跟无人驾驶一定会走到一起。
In conclusion, I think the new infrastructure should be based on non-human participation, so new infrastructure and driverless must come together.
同时，物流、智能制造、供应链等，都是充分市场化的，无人驾驶公司也应该思考，如何通过一个充分市场化的手段去使能（enable）新基建。
At the same time, logistics, intelligent manufacturing, supply chains, and so on, are fully market-oriented, and unmanned companies should think about how to enable new infrastructure through a fully market-based approach.
无人驾驶商业化需要满足四个条件什么样的无人驾驶技术应该商业化？这里面有三个关键的要素：1、高频刚需，2、法律和技术上规模可行，3、算得过账。
There are three key elements of what kind of unmanned technology should be commercialized: 1) high frequency just needed, 2) legally and technically feasible, and 3) accountable.
展开说，就是法律上拥有合规路权，技术上实现去安全员，商业模式可持续，能为客户降本增效，公司自己也有利润。
Extended, that is, legally have the right to comply with the road, the technology to achieve security, sustainable business models, can be cost-effective customers, the company has its own profits.
回顾驭势科技走过的路，也经过了几次试错，有些只能部分满足上面三点。
Looking back on the path that controlling technology has taken, there have been several trial and error, some only partially satisfied the above three points.
我们最早开始做无人小巴，法律和技术上可行，但还不是客户的刚需和痛点，只取代一个驾驶员，盈利模式暂时也成问题。
We were one of the first to start taking a minibus, legally and technically feasible, but not yet the customer's immediate needs and pain point, replacing only one driver, and the profit model is temporarily problematic.
后来做了自动代客泊车AVP，由于法律和保险等问题，大规模商业化还需要一两年，同时toC的业务对成本的要求也非常高，在盈利模式上仍需探索。
It took a year or two to commercialise it on a large scale, due to legal and insurance issues, and the ToC business had very high cost requirements, which needed to be explored in the profit-making model.
目前驭势科技的几项业务，就拿机场的无人物流来说，场景刚需、法律和技术上已经实现无人化，一辆车能帮助机场取代两到三个司机的成本，公司自身也能从中盈利。
With a few operations at the airport, such as unmanned airport logistics, the scene has been dehumanized, legally and technically, and a car can help replace two or three drivers at the airport, making the company itself profitable.
目前来看，整个一季度大家都非常惨淡，驭势科技的营收和订单量却有大幅增长。
At the moment, everyone is very bleak throughout the quarter, but the command technology revenue and orders have increased significantly.
而要真正实现商业化，还要满足四化：无人化、常态化、规模化、运营化。
In order to realize the commercialization, we must satisfy the four aspects: dehumanization, normalization, scale and operation.
前三化都好理解，运营化就是不再是象征性、示范性地跑，而是要嵌入到客户的业务当中，满足物流的节拍。
The first three are easy to understand, operational is no longer a symbolic, exemplary run, but embedded in the business of customers, to meet the pace of logistics.
另外操作员一定是客户方的操作工人，而不是你的工程师。
Also the operator must be the customer's operator, not your engineer.
事实上，在驭势科技的商业模式当中，主要的利润并不是来自于一次性地卖产品，而是来自于长期运维。
Indeed, in its business model of command technology, the main profit comes not from one-off sales, but from long-term operations.
要判断一家公司是不是达到这四化也很简单。
It is also easy to judge whether a company has achieved this quadrupling.
首先，看这家公司是不是有非常完整的安全测试的基础设施，我们公司现在在一个四十几亩地的测试场上，每天有近十种车型在里面24小时测试。
First, to see if the company has a very complete safety test infrastructure, our company is now in a forty-acre testing ground, nearly 10 models a day in the test inside 24 hours.
常态化这块你只要蹲点一个礼拜，看它是不是风雨无阻的在提供服务，而且无人。
Normalize this piece as long as you squat for a week, to see if it is rain or shine in the service, and no one.
规模化方面你只要把车的引擎盖或者后备箱打开，里面如果到处是设备和电线，肯定不是规模化，应该是方方正正的一两个盒子。
To get to scale, just open the hood or trunk of your car. If it's full of equipment and wiring, it's definitely not a scale, it's a square box or two.
运营化则是去看合同，看其是否拿到了头部客户的上量的运营合同，而不是POC或示范。
Operationalization is to look at the contract to see if it gets a head client's high-volume operating contract, rather than POC or demonstration.
未来无人驾驶这个市场非常大，我们的发展逻辑是从商用车到乘用车，从特定场景到多个特定场景再到通用场景。
The future driverless market is huge, and our logic is to move from commercial vehicles to passenger cars, from specific scenarios to multiple specific scenarios to generic scenarios.
我们不试图做整车，就做一个盒子（智能驾驶控制器）以及后面的云脑，和合作伙伴一起把整个产品解决方案做出来，所以我们具有很强的场景和业务扩展能力。
Instead of trying to make a full car, we make a box (smart driving controller) and a cloud behind it, and work with partners to make the whole product solution, so we have strong scenarios and business expansion capabilities.
但即便是做特定场景，要想实现0误差也很难。
But even with a particular scenario, it's hard to achieve zero error.
一个学生考一次100分是极有可能的，但你要他连续几万次几十万次考100分，就很难。
It's quite possible for a student to get 100 points at a time, but if you ask him to do hundreds of thousands of tests in a row, it will be very difficult.
过去这两年中，我们就是在努力的连续几万次考100分。
In the past two years, we have been trying to do tens of thousands of times to test 100 points.
对话吴甘沙：我不看好一些厂家略过L3直接跨到L4燃财经：前不久，中国版的自动驾驶分级标准出炉，你认为目前中国的自动驾驶技术发展到了哪个阶段？吴甘沙：在很长时间里，L2和L4两者是共存的。
Wu Gansha: I am not optimistic that some manufacturers skip L3 and go straight to L4-Flaming Finance and Finance: Recently, the Chinese version of the Automatic Driving Scale came out, which stage do you think China's auto-driving technology has reached? Wu Gansha: For a long time, L2 and L4 coexisted.
L2更多用在乘用车，而L4更多是在商用车，在一些特定场景当中去使用。
L2 is used more in passenger cars, while L4 is used more in commercial vehicles and in certain situations.
L3是最近比较有争议性的一个技术，有的厂家说要略过L3，直接跨到L4，我不怎么看好。
L3 is one of the most controversial technologies in the world. Some companies say they skip L3 and go straight to L4. I don't think so.
虽然L3跟L2从功能形态上来看非常像，L2分为TJA（交通拥堵辅助）和HWA（高速公路辅助），L3分为TJP（拥堵自动驾驶）和HWP（高速自动驾驶）。
Although L3 is very similar to L2 in functional form, L2 is divided into TJA (traffic-assisted) and HWA (highway-assisted), L3 is divided into TJP (congested auto-driving) and HWP (high-speed automatic driving).
但L3带来的好处就是驾驶员能真正释放双手双脚双眼和身心，他可以做其他的事情。
But the advantage of L3 is that the driver can really release his hands, feet, eyes, body and mind, he can do other things.
相比L2来说，L3其实是一个非常有价值、有意义的功能形态。
Compared with L2, L3 is actually a very valuable and meaningful functional form.
另外一方面，从实现的难度上面来说，L3要比L4简单很多。
On the other hand, L3 is much easier than L4 in terms of implementation difficulty.
只不过L3现在面临几个问题。
It's just that the L3 is facing several problems.
第一，人机如何切换的问题。
First, how to switch between man and machine.
当车子需要人员操作时，它需要自己减速靠边，给予驾驶员足够多的时间来接管，这个动作几乎已经达到了L4的能力。
When the car needs people to operate, it needs to slow down to the side and give the driver enough time to take over, a move that has almost reached L4 capacity.
第二就是成本，L3的成本比L2贵上一个数量级，这对于普通的乘用车消费者来说，难以承受。
Second, the cost of L3 is an order of magnitude higher than L2, which is unaffordable for the average passenger car consumer.
更关键的是责任认定的问题。
More critical is the issue of accountability.
大家看特斯拉，用的词叫FSD，其实是L2+，因为它不敢承担这个责任。
Look at Tesla. The word FSD is actually L2 + because it is afraid to take on the responsibility.
车子出了事故以后，如果是L2+，司机也是有责任的，但是一旦变成L3，那么在主要情况下，则需要车厂供应商去承担这个责任。
After the accident, the driver is also responsible if it is L2 +, but once it becomes L3, then in the main, it is up to the manufacturer to assume the responsibility.
燃财经：距离实现L3、L4自动驾驶技术量产还有多远？吴甘沙：我认为未来三五年，L3一定会出来，可能先是TJP，再是HWP，前不久发改委发布的智能汽车发展战略里面，把L3的大规模普及放到了2025年。
Wu Gansha: I think L3 will come out in the next three to five years, perhaps first by TJP and then by HWP, and recently in the SmartCar Development Strategy released by the NDRC, we have put L3 on a massive scale until 2025.
至于L4，如果是特定场景下的垂直细分的L4，今年可以说是元年，但像Robotaxi这样的L4，坦率来说没有人能够去预测，因为前面的每一次预测都被打脸了，行业认为还需要五到十年。
As for L4, which is vertically subdivided in a particular scenario, this year could be called the first year, but L4 like Robotaxi is frankly no one can predict, because every previous forecast is discredited and the industry thinks it will take another five to ten years.
真正的5GV2X大规模商业化要到2024年左右燃财经：你曾说过“今年会是无人驾驶的洗牌年”，你认为什么样的公司会在这轮洗牌中被淘汰？又是什么样的公司可以存活下来？吴甘沙：其实整个无人驾驶是一个非常长的赛道，这个行业是一个资金密集型、人才密集型、长期煎熬才能迎来破局点的行业。
The real 5GV2X is going to be commercialized on a large scale around 2024: what kind of company do you think will be out of the shuffle this year? What kind of company do you think will survive this shuffle? Wu Gansha: The whole driverless is a very long track, a capital-intensive, talent-intensive, long-suffering industry.
往前走的过程当中，一定有人慢慢掉队。
Someone must be falling behind as we go along.
如果说把2015年作为无人驾驶的元年，到今年已经第五年了。
If 2015 is the first year of unmanned aerial vehicles, it is the fifth year this year.
任何一个行业，到了第五年都会变得非常有紧迫感，一方面公司自己也有疲惫感，一方面大家会对这家公司产生怀疑，所以今年的确是到了该交作业的一年。
Any industry, by the fifth year, will become very urgent, on the one hand, the company itself is tired, on the one hand, people will be suspicious of the company, so this is really the due year.
疫情会带来一些热度，一些大的投资事件会带来一些信心，但是本质上，还是要在技术上、商业模式上走通。
The epidemic will bring some heat, some big investment events will bring some confidence, but the essence of the technology, business model or go through.
燃财经：你认为5G浪潮会给行业带来哪些变化？会增加哪些应用场景和商业化落地？吴甘沙：5G我觉得大家要一分为二去看。
Caijing: What do you think the 5G Wave will do to the industry? What applications will it add and commercialize? Wu Gansha: 5G I think we should split it into two.
一方面，5G是历史上第一个不是面向人的，而是面向物的网络。
On the one hand, the 5G is the first time in history that it is not human-oriented, but object-oriented.
它一定会给今天的很多商业场景，包括无人驾驶、工业互联网带来无限的想象空间。
It is bound to give today's many business scenarios, including unmanned, industrial Internet to bring unlimited imagination.
我相信未来，5G大规模应用以后，车会变成非常笨的车，靠一个全局的城市大脑就能够指挥好，整个社会的成本也会降到最低。
I believe that in the future, when 5G is used on a large scale, the car will become a very stupid car, under the command of a global urban brain, and the cost to society as a whole will be minimized.
但另外一方面看，真正成熟的5G并没有那么快。
But on the other hand, the really mature 5G isn't that fast.
我们今天其实已经在应用很多V2X（车对外界的信息交换）技术，而这些技术一般来说还是LTE-V2X，需要在公网或者是专网上面去使用。
We are already using a lot of V2X (car-to-outside information exchange) technology, which is generally LTE-V2X, and which needs to be used on public networks or on dedicated networks.
真正的5GV2X（NRV2X），真正大规模商业化要到2024年左右。
The real 5GV2X (NRV2X), truly large-scale commercialization will be around 2024.
短期内，我们还没办法去指望5GV2X能够给我们带来想象中的好处，比如说边缘计算等。
In the short term, we can't expect the 5GV2X to bring us the benefits we imagine, such as edge computing.
V2X其实已经在很大程度上帮助了无人驾驶，比如说交通灯。
The V2X has actually helped a lot with unmanned aerial vehicles, such as traffic lights.
今天大部分还是通过摄像头去识别红绿灯，但在一些情况下，比如说强逆光下根本看不清楚。
Today most traffic lights are identified by cameras, but in some cases, such as strong backlighting, they are not clear at all.
这时候如果说交通灯本身有能在红绿灯切换的时候，通过PC5的协议进行广播，我的车马上就知道了，对动作进行预判，这是一个非常有用的商业场景。
If the traffic lights themselves can be switched at the traffic lights, broadcast via the PC 5 protocol, my car will know immediately, to predict the action, this is a very useful business scene.
还有很多其他的商业场景，比如说车路协同，远程监控和远程驾驶。
There are many other business scenarios, such as car-to-road collaboration, remote monitoring, and long-range driving.
但远程只能够给指令，这些指令是不是可以安全地执行，也取决于车端本身的决策逻辑，它能够去做判断。
But the remote can only give instructions, and whether they can be safely executed or not depends on the decision logic of the car itself, which is able to make judgments.
它如果认为这个指令不安全，是可以去否决远程指令的，这里面也可以运用到物联网网络安全技术，使得远程驾驶和车端智能有一个最合理的结合。
If it thinks the command is unsafe, it can veto remote commands, which can also be used for Internet-of-Things network security technology, allowing for the most reasonable combination of remote driving and end-of-car intelligence.
创业得有空杯心态还要放下身段燃财经：从英特尔中国研究院到进入商业世界，你曾说过自己在创业的过程中放下了“理想化”，“理想化”具体是指哪些方面？经历了什么样的转变过程？吴甘沙：这几年深感创业不易，需要逐步放下“理想化”。
From Intel's China Research Institute to entering the business world, you've talked about what it means to be "idealized" and "idealized" in your business startups. What kind of transformation have you been going through? Wu Gansha: These years, it's been hard to start a business.
“理想化”主要是几个方面，一个是对技术过分乐观，一个平台带给自己的光环消失，心态没有放平。
"Idealization" is mainly in several ways, one is too optimistic about technology, a platform to bring their own halo disappeared, the mentality did not calm down.
我创业第一年制定了一个非常激进的计划。
In my first year of business, I made a very aggressive plan.
我出来创业是二月份，原本希望到六月份，有三辆车能够跑起来，其中有一辆还要是Robotaxi这个级别的，后来就面临很多的问题。
I started my business in February, and I had hoped that by June, three cars would be able to run, one of them at Robotaxi's level.
比如很多零部件搞不到，需要供应商定制。
For example, many parts are not available and need to be customized by suppliers.
以前我在英特尔的时候，要供应商帮忙，对方答应都非常快。
I used to ask suppliers for help when I was at Intel, and the other side promised very quickly.
刚刚创业后，这些供应商一开始答应的好好的，临到时间就说太忙了做不出来。
Just after the start-up, these suppliers initially promised to do well, the time came to say too busy to do.
所以后来我意识到，创业很多东西都要按照最坏的情况去预测，还得放下身段。
So then I realized that a lot of things to start a business are based on the worst-case scenario, but also have to put down their position.
另外，在创业环境中，大公司学到的一些管理理念往往不适配，很多东西必须得重新去学，所以要有空杯心态。
In addition, in an entrepreneurial environment, some of the management concepts learned by large companies often do not fit well, and many things have to be learned again, so be open-minded.
创业确实是一个不断去除理想化而变得更加现实、更加有敬畏之心、更加尊重客观规律的过程。
Starting a business is really a process of getting rid of idealization and becoming more realistic, more awe-inspiring and more respectful of objective laws.
一边把理想化彻底放下，一边心头保留一丝用技术改变世界的火焰，两种心态交织之中往前走。
While putting the idealization down completely, while retaining a trace of technology to change the world's flames, two mentality interweave to move forward.
