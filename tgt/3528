南方+客户端3月12日，广东省人民政府新闻办公室举行新闻发布会，通报广东新冠肺炎疫情和防控工作情况，重点介绍广东新冠肺炎防控科研攻关的近期工作进展情况。
The Information Office of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government held a press conference on March 12 to report on the situation of the new crown pneumonia in Guangdong and the prevention and control of the disease.
中国工程院院士钟南山出席会议并答记者问。
Chinese Academy of Engineering academician Zhong Nan Shan attended the meeting and answered questions.
“ 目前国外疫情病死率约3.2%，类似早期武汉情况问：请问钟院士对于防控境外输入方面，您有什么建议？钟南山：现在我们很多省份都是零增长，证明在我们联防联控的机制下，疫情得到了较好的控制。
At present, the mortality rate of epidemic diseases in foreign countries is about 3.2%, similar to that in early Wuhan. What suggestions do you have for the prevention and control of foreign imports? Zhong Nan Shan: Many of our provinces now have zero growth, which proves that the epidemic has been well controlled under our joint control mechanism.
方舱最大的作用是把病人和正常人给分开了。
The most important function of the cabin is to separate the patient from the normal person.
但是现在慢慢转化为境外输入，现在境外输入往往没有明显症状，要在隔离过程中检测才发现患新冠肺炎。
But now slowly transforms into the overseas input, now often does not have the obvious symptom, only then detects in the isolation process to have the new crown pneumonia.
当然有些还是有症状的，这与我国一开始收治病人的情况有些类似。
Some, of course, are symptomatic, which is somewhat similar to the way we treated patients in the first place.
有些人出现感冒症状，不当回事，但是后来回国后检测发现得了新冠肺炎。
Some people have cold symptoms, do not take seriously, but later home after the test found that the new crown pneumonia.
说明国外对自身情况还不够重视，我国需要做更多的检测，假如真有变异，可能会产生再感染现象。
It shows that foreign countries do not pay enough attention to their own situation, China needs to do more testing, if there is a real mutation, may produce re-infection.
因此现在要注意加强对境外输入患者的管控。
Attention should therefore now be paid to strengthening the control of patients entering the country abroad.
特别是广东，跟国外的关系较为密切，值得注意这一新的传染源、传染途径。
Guangdong, in particular, has a close relationship with foreign countries, which is worth noting as a new source of infection and a means of transmission.
应该注意什么呢，还是要按照赴境外人员新冠肺炎防控工作指引来考虑，应该做核酸检测，现在核酸检测准确性提高很多。
What should be noted, or in accordance with the guidelines for the prevention and control of New Crown Pneumonia abroad, should be done nucleic acid testing, now the accuracy of nucleic acid detection has improved considerably.
我们需要更多与国外沟通，我现在已经跟很多国家沟通，包括跟欧洲做视频讲课、跟哈佛有学术交流、召开五个国家和地区的视频交流会，交流以后发现我们的看法还是有差距。
We need to communicate more with foreign countries. I have already communicated with many countries, including video lectures with Europe, academic exchanges with Harvard, and video exchanges with five countries and regions.
中国在不到两个月的时间内，有了自己的看法体会和教训，与国外的交流还是很重要，这有利于我们加深对目前治疗方式的认识，也减少国外走弯路，降低国外病死率。
In less than two months, China has had its own views and lessons learned, and exchanges with foreign countries are still important, which will help us to better understand the current treatment methods, reduce detours abroad and reduce the foreign mortality rate.
我刚刚看了一下国外总共是有4万多确诊病例，死亡率超过3.2%，说明老百姓的警觉性还不是很高。
I have just taken a look at a total of more than 40,000 confirmed cases abroad, with a mortality rate of more than 3.2 per cent, which shows that people are not very alert.
昨晚我国华西医科大学已经派医疗队援助意大利，现在加强这方面的交流还是非常重要。
Last night, our Western China Medical University sent medical teams to assist Italy. It is still very important to strengthen exchanges in this regard.
要在两个月内研发出特效药，或者特殊的做法还是不太可能。
It is unlikely that specific drugs, or special procedures, will be developed within two months.
但是，总有办法可以制止其发展和恶化，现在在中国除湖北外，外地的病死率也不到1%。
However, there is always a way to stop its development and deterioration, and the death rate in China, excluding Hubei, is less than 1%.
因此现在一方面要加强自身管控，另一方面要加强与国外的交流。
Therefore, on the one hand to strengthen their own control, on the other hand to strengthen communication with foreign countries.
现在不从全球范围内控制好的话，是不可能战胜疫情。
It is impossible to defeat the epidemic without controlling it on a global scale.
“ 6月份结束疫情是可以期待的我们当时评估，疫情在6月可能结束，前提是其他国家都像我国一样，对新冠肺炎疫情给予国家层面的重视。
"The end of the outbreak in June was something to look forward to. We assessed then that the outbreak might end in June, provided that other countries, like my own, paid attention to the national dimension of the outbreak.
现在看来，一些国家做得比较好，有些国家的认识并不准确。
It now appears that some countries are doing better and that some are not.
当然，现在也在改变，因为病例越来越多了，引起老百姓的关注，不把它当成流感来看了，我们很高兴。
Of course, it is changing now, because more and more cases, people's attention, do not see it as flu, we are very happy.
假如全球国家中有一些并没有重视新冠肺炎的危害性、传染性，进行强烈干预的话，结束的时间可能还会延长。
If some countries around the world do not pay attention to the danger of pneumonia, infectious, strong intervention, the end of the time may be extended.
冠状病毒在温度比较高的夏天是不活跃的，可能慢慢会下去，但结束时间差一两个月，对国家的影响差别很大，社会会动荡，国民经济增长都将有很大的影响。
The coronavirus is inactive in the warmer summers and may go down slowly, but the end of the virus is a month or two away and the impact on the country will be very different, the society will be unstable and the national economic growth will be greatly affected.
世界卫生组织把新冠肺炎提升到“大流行”，就是希望各国都采取措施去预防疾病。
The World Health Organization raised the level of pneumonia to a "pandemic" in the hope that all countries would take steps to prevent the disease.
像意大利，病死率接近6%，一下子病例太多了，会产生很多医疗资源问题，比如病床少、医生照顾不到等问题，这个实际上提高到国家层面了，就是看每个国家能不能正确、积极地面对这个问题。
Italy, for example, has a fatality rate of close to 6 per cent, with too many cases at once, and there are many medical resource problems, such as the shortage of beds and the inability of doctors to care for them, which has actually been raised to the national level to see whether each country can face the problem correctly and positively.
我们从死亡率看，意大利很高，美国、法国、西班牙的病死率都在2%以上，这必须得到足够的重视。
We have a very high mortality rate in Italy, 2 percent or more in the United States, France and Spain, which must be given due attention.
因为从我国的情况看，平均也是在3%左右，但在湖北武汉的病死率和湖北以外的病死率差别很大。
Because in China's case, the average is around 3%, but in Hubei Wuhan and Hubei disease mortality rate is very different.
这证明，国家层面的管控是很有作用的。
This attests to the usefulness of regulation at the national level.
我的建议是，各国应该听从世卫组织的呼吁，在国家层面的，各国都能动员起来。
My suggestion is that countries should heed the call of WHO and mobilize at the national level.
我很高兴的是，意大利和韩国都已经开始行动了，韩国的新增病例近日下降得比较明显。
I am pleased that both Italy and South Korea have already begun to act, and that the number of new cases in South Korea has fallen sharply in recent days.
如果各国都能这样做。
If all States could do the same.
我们评估的疫情在6月结束，还是有可能实现的。
The outbreak we assessed ended in June and is still possible.
“ 目前看来复阳病人没有传染性大家很关心，新冠肺炎复阳病人是否要住院隔离？钟南山表示，有不少病人出院后核酸检测阳性，是非常值得关注的问题，他最近做了很多调研和研究。
"At present, it seems that patients with Fuyang are not infectious. Does the patient need to be hospitalized and quarantined? There are many patients who have tested positive for nucleic acid after discharge from hospital, Zhong Nan Shan said.
“我们知道核酸检测是检测核酸片段。
"We know nucleic acid testing is the detection of nucleic acid fragments.
”钟南山分析，从病原学角度来看，治愈的病人已经产生抗体，对新冠病毒有很强的杀灭作用。
Zhong Nan Shan analysis, from a etiological point of view, cured patients have produced antibodies that have a strong antibody effect on the new crown virus.
因此，对大多复阳病人来说，重复感染的机会很少，除非有极个别没痊愈的，可能会感染。
Therefore, for most patients with Fuyang, the chance of reinfection is very low, unless there are rare uncured, may be infected.
复阳病人的密切接触者，会不会被感染？钟南山的答案是，“到现在为止，我所收集到的资料，好像基本没看见，我们要看事实。
Can close contacts of patients in Fuyang be infected? The answer from Zhong Nan Shan is, "The information I have collected so far seems to be largely unseen, and we have to look at the facts.
”他举例，香港玛嘉烈医院传染病中心主任曾德贤跟踪10多例复阳病人，并用病人样本在P3实验室培养病毒，但没有培养出活病毒。
For example, TSANG Tak-yin, Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases at Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital, followed more than 10 patients with Fuyang.
这说明，样本中检测到的可能是新冠病毒的残余核酸片段。
This suggests that fragments of residual nucleic acid from the new crown virus may have been detected in the samples.
接下来，对复阳病人还要继续观察。
Next, continue to observe the patients in Fuyang.
钟南山说：“我们做了一些工作，香港同事们也做了一些工作，我把事实讲出来，没有查出活病毒，看起来不应该有传染性。
"We have done some work and our colleagues in Hong Kong have done some work," Zhong said. "I'm telling you the truth.
”目前核酸检查是检测新冠病毒感染的主要手段，请问钟院士，您带领团队开发的咽拭子采样机器人，与常规人工采样相比，有哪些优势？钟南山回答，采样就是一个传染途径，取样过程要保护采样人员。
At present, nucleic acid testing is the main way to detect infection with the new crown virus. Academician Zhong, what are the advantages of your team-developed swabs and swabs compared to conventional manual sampling?
同时采样规范性比较差，差别比较大，拭子采样机器人基本上是同一个规范采样方法，真实性会更强。
At the same time, the sampling regulation is poor, the difference is big, swab sampling robot is basically the same standard sampling method, the authenticity will be stronger.
机器人实验符合率高，现在开始验证病人的符合率情况。
Robot experiments with a high coincidence rate are now beginning to verify patient compliance.
