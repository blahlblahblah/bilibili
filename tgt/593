平时生活节奏太快，就像开车开到120码，突然停下，大家都不适应。
Usually the pace of life is too fast, like driving to 120 yards, suddenly stopped, everyone is not used to.
口述 | 严　欣整理|王仲昀很多温州人在外经商，每到春节就要回老家过年，我们一家是年前从上海回来的。
Wang Zhongyun, a large number of Wenzhou people who do business abroad, return home for the Spring Festival every Spring Festival. Our family returned from Shanghai a year ago.
全国人民都在新闻中看到，约18万温州人在武汉，其中有4.8万人从武汉回来。
The whole country saw in the news that about 180,000 Wenzhou people were in Wuhan, of whom 48,000 had returned from Wuhan.
目前我们温州新冠肺炎疫情的形势比较紧张，生活方式也完全被改变了。
At present, the situation of Wenzhou New Crown Pneumonia epidemic is relatively tense, lifestyle has been completely changed.
我老家在温州市永嘉县下面的一个乡镇，叫桥头镇，距离温州市区大概30公里，开车一会就到了。
My hometown in Wenzhou Yongjia County, a town called Qiaotou, about 30 kilometers from downtown Wenzhou, a short drive will arrive.
过年前母亲生病了，在温州市区住院，之前我要经常从村里开车去温州市区。
Mother was ill before New Year's Eve and was hospitalized in Wenzhou city. I used to drive from the village to Wenzhou city.
老人家年纪大了，我们姐妹几人就轮流去看望和照顾她。
When the old man was old, several of our sisters took turns to see and take care of her.
一开始我们给母亲请了保姆，有时候我们和保姆都会在医院照顾她。
At first we hired a babysitter for our mother, and sometimes we and the babysitter would take care of her in the hospital.
但是随着疫情越来越严峻，温州的防控不断升级。
But with the increasingly severe epidemic Wenzhou prevention and control has been escalating.
到后来，医院通知说，一个床位只能一人陪护了，所以要么我们在，要么保姆在。
Later, the hospital informed that a bed could only be accompanied by one person, so either we were there, or the babysitter was there.
温州市区从2月1日开始，规定每家每两天可指派1名家庭成员出门采购。
In Wenzhou, a family member may be assigned to go shopping every two days, starting February 1.
从那时候开始，住在市里面的妹妹就每两天出门买东西，顺带去医院看望一下母亲。
From then on, my sister, who lived in the city, went shopping every two days and took her to the hospital to see her mother.
这次新冠肺炎疫情暴发后，温州的县级市乐清情况最严重。
After the outbreak of the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Wenzhou county-level city of Yueqing the most serious situation.
乐清距离我们永嘉大概70公里。
Yueqing is about 70 kilometers away from us.
永嘉这里还好，至少我所在的镇上，目前为止只有一人被确诊。
Yongjia is fine. At least one person in my town has been diagnosed so far.
我了解到的情况是，这人过年前从武汉回来，不过他回来比较早，当时还不像现在这么严峻。
What I have learned is that this man came back from Wuhan over New Year's Eve, but he came back earlier than he is now.
那个人现在已经痊愈，所幸他家人现在也都过了14天隔离期，没有被感染。
The man has now recovered, and fortunately his family has now passed the 14-day isolation period and has not been infected.
村与村之间的道路几天前已经被封闭虽然不像乐清那么严重，但是永嘉的防控也在不断加强，这一点我深有体会。
The road between the village and the village was closed a few days ago. Although it is not as serious as Yueqing, Yongjia's control is constantly being strengthened.
一开始进出我们镇的交通是畅通的，后来开始“半封闭”——你如果想出去，可以去镇政府开一个通行证，只要你有正当的理由。
The traffic to and from our town was smooth at first, and then it began to be "semi-closed" - if you wanted to go out, you could go to the town government and issue a pass, provided you had a good reason.
比如你要回工作的地方上班，那么你让单位给你开一个证明，一般都会给你通行证。
For example, if you want to go back to work, then you ask the work unit to give you a certificate, will generally give you a pass.
像我，因为母亲住院，我隔几天要去温州市区探望她，我也有这个通行证。
Like me, because my mother is in hospital, I have to visit her every few days in downtown Wenzhou, I also have this pass.
完全“封镇”前，居民依靠通行证进出没过多久，交通就完全封闭了。
Before the town was completely "closed," the traffic was completely closed for a short time as residents relied on permits to get in and out.
2月5日下午3点，我们这里除了医护人员、警察还有政府的人员，其他人一律进不来也出不去。
At 3: 00 p.m. on February 5, no one else was allowed in, not even the paramedics, the police or the government.
我外甥本来要回广东上班的，现在连镇都出不去了。
My nephew was supposed to go back to work in Guangdong, and now he can't even get out of town.
我也没法去医院看我母亲，就只好指望温州市里的妹妹。
I couldn't go to the hospital to see my mother, so I had to look to my sister in Wenzhou.
虽然封镇了，但是我们生活还是有保障的。
Though the town has been closed, our lives are still secure.
现在附近的一些大型菜市场和超市还开着。
Some of the larger markets and supermarkets in the vicinity are still open.
这几天我跟家人朋友们说，叫大家没什么特殊情况就别到处跑了。
I've been telling my family and friends these days not to go anywhere without special conditions.
管好自己，也就不给别人添麻烦。
Mind your own business so that you don't cause trouble for others.
我去医院看望母亲路上来回的时候，好几次看到镇路口那些年轻的交警和其他工作人员，他们连吃饭的地方都没，就坐在路边吃快餐。
On my way back and forth to the hospital, I saw on several occasions the young traffic police and other staff at the intersection, sitting by the side of the road eating fast food, without a place to eat.
我想说，大家就别给他们带去不方便了，换位思考，这些小伙子如果是自家孩子，我们不会心疼吗？过年那几天我就跟家人说，大家别互相串门了，我们就微信上发个红包，拜个年。
I would like to say, people do not bring them inconvenient, change their thinking, if these boys are their own children, we will not hurt? The New Year's Day I said to my family, do not visit each other, we send a red envelope on the letter, a good year.
不是我怕死，这真的是为了减少自己和他人的麻烦。
It's not that I'm afraid of death. It's really about reducing my troubles and those of others.
交警坐在路边吃饭前几天，除了担心我母亲，我也在为女儿开学而发愁。
A few days before the traffic police sat by the roadside for dinner, I was worried about my daughter starting school, in addition to my mother.
她在上海读书，本来正常开学是2月17日，我得早点带她回去，这样14天隔离结束了她能赶上开学。
She went to school in Shanghai. It was Feb. 17 and I had to take her back early, so the 14-day isolation ended and she could make it to school.
不过看到上海那边通知说不会在3月之前开学，我也放心了，暂时就在老家继续呆着。
However, seeing the Shanghai side of the notice that will not start school before March, I also feel relieved, temporarily stay at home.
完全“封镇”后的路口女儿班级的家长群里，老师和其他家长也关心我们，因为知道我们回温州老家过年，这边疫情又比较严重。
After the "closure" of the intersection of daughter's class parents, teachers and other parents also care about us, because we know we return to Wenzhou home New Year, the epidemic situation here is more serious.
每个孩子的家长，现在每天都要填写学校发的问卷，就是报告人在哪里，小朋友在家做什么，这些信息都要向老师汇报。
The parents of each child now fill out a questionnaire from the school every day, reporting where the person is and what the child is doing at home. This information is reported to the teacher.
我们家长也能看到彼此的问卷，这样大家都放心了。
We parents can also see each other's questionnaires, so that everyone is relieved.
我跟其他家长说了，你们不用担心，我和女儿回上海后，肯定自觉在家隔离14天。
I told the other parents, you don't have to worry, my daughter and I returned to Shanghai, I must feel at home isolation for 14 days.
这次疫情，对老百姓来说，就像是一次生活的“急刹车”。
This outbreak, for the common people, is like a life of the "brakes."
平时在城市里，上班啊忙啊加班啊，都成了常态。
Usually in the city, work ah busy ah overtime ah, have become the norm.
周末或者节假日能休息几天，特别开心。
Rest for a few days on weekends or holidays.
现在别说加班了，上班也不用去，大家都天天在家呆着，突然觉得很不习惯。
Now do not say overtime, do not go to work, we all stay at home every day, suddenly feel very strange.
往年我最晚初五就和家人回上海了，今年一直到现在，还不知道什么时候能离开。
I returned to Shanghai with my family at the latest on the fifth day of last year. I still don't know when I can leave.
平时生活节奏太快，就像开车开到120码，突然停下，大家都不适应，我也期盼疫情能够早日结束，我的老家温州以及全国各地的生活都能恢复正常。
Usually the pace of life is too fast, like driving to 120 yards, suddenly stopped, everyone is not used to it, I also hope that the epidemic will end soon, my hometown Wenzhou and all over the country can be normal life.
