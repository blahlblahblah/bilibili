这个春节是我开超市来最忙的春节口述/占先生现在，我每天也要送货了，开着我的路虎车。
The Spring Festival is the busiest time for me to open a supermarket. / Mr. Zhan Now, I have to deliver goods every day and drive my Land Rover.
我昨天送货一直送到晚上9点多，我把货放到各小区门口，微信群里说一声，然后他们下来拿。
I delivered goods yesterday until more than 9: 00 pm, I put the goods to the community door, micro-letter group to say, and then they came down to take.
昨晚回到家，吃点东西洗洗就睡了，今天早上6点又起来做事了。
I went home last night, ate some food and went to bed. I got up at 6 o'clock this morning.
我来杭州20年，开超市13年。
I have come to Hangzhou for 20 years to open a supermarket for 13 years.
很多超市都是我们老家人开的，超市业是我们当地的支柱产业之一。
A lot of supermarkets are run by our old family. Supermarkets are one of our local pillar industries.
虽然这生意利润不高风险高，每天操心的事很多，但这么多年来勤勤恳恳，再加上家乡人的帮助，开超市也让我们一家住上了大房子，开上了路虎。
Although the business is not high-risk business, daily worry a lot of things, but so many years of hard work, coupled with the help of the home people, opened the supermarket also let our family live in a large house, driving a Land Rover.
这个春节是我开超市来最忙的春节。
This Spring Festival is the busiest one for me to open a supermarket.
我这个当老板的开了大大小小十几家超市，之前都是由第三方公司送货的，现在要自己送货，我老婆也开始当收银员了。
As a boss, I opened a dozen or so supermarkets, all of which were delivered by third-party companies, and now I have to deliver my own goods. My wife is starting to work as a cashier.
我的员工们最近都提心吊胆，因为每天要接触三五百个顾客。
My staff have been on the fence lately, since they have to deal with three to five hundred customers a day.
他们一天洗很多次手，但是说还是怕。
They wash their hands many times a day, but they are afraid.
有的担心得不敢回家，怕万一有什么害了家人。
Some are too worried to go home for fear that something might happen to their families.
可是不回家，又想家里的老婆孩子。
But I don't go home, and I want my wife and kids.
还有的房东说，别出去做生意了，房子我给你们免费住。
And some landlords said, do not go out to do business, I give you a house for free.
超市开，是冒险，不开，社区那么多老百姓的日常又怎么保障？我最近总是睡不着。
The supermarket opens, is adventurous, does not open, the community so many people's daily how safeguard? I always cannot sleep recently.
01开着路虎去送货，老婆当起收银员腊月二十八我才回老家，但是怎么都待不住。
01 driving the Land Rover to deliver goods, his wife when the cashier Lai 28 I only go home, but how can not stay.
新闻越看越焦虑。
The news gets more and more anxious.
按照往年我怎么也要过了正月十五才回杭州，这次正月初三我就跟老婆开着车回来了。
In accordance with how I have to go back to Hangzhou after the fifteenth day of the first month, this third day of the first month I drove back with his wife.
我的超市都是社区型，最大的有一千多平方米，一个店有20多个员工。
My supermarket is all community type, the biggest has more than 1000 square meters, a shop has more than 20 employees.
这次回来，我主要盯最大的两间超市，这两家对周围老百姓的影响最大。
On my return, I focused mainly on the two largest supermarkets, which had the greatest impact on the surrounding population.
我让我们的员工能回来的都赶紧回来上班，要坚持供应生鲜，要保证米粮，这个时候对顾客要不离不弃。
I let our staff come back to work quickly, to insist on the supply of fresh, to ensure rice, this time to customers not to abandon.
结果，我们最大那家超市只有三四个员工了。
As a result, our biggest supermarket has only three or four employees.
有的困在老家回不来了，有的回来了，但是困在距离超市只有200米的小区里了，因为小区封了，只出不进，要是出来了，就回不去了。
Some stranded at home, some back, but trapped in the supermarket is only 200 meters away from the community, because the small area sealed, only out, if out, can not go back.
还有的说，回来了，但是没地方住了，因为房东不让租客住了。
Still others said, came back, but did not have the place to live, because the landlord did not let the tenant live.
我让没地方住的员工住我家，现在我家里已经住了3个了，需要的话大家挤挤还可以住。
I let the staff who have no place to live live in my home, now I have three, if need be, people can still live in crowded.
我还想去哪里打个证明，把困在旁边小区里的员工接出来，这个事还没有办成，我要抓紧去试试。
I also want to go somewhere to prove that the staff trapped in the neighborhood to pick up, this matter has not been accomplished, I want to try to hurry.
员工也没有饭吃了，总不能天天吃泡面吧。
Employees do not have food to eat, can not eat noodles every day bar.
我找朋友帮忙，他在超市附近开了家面馆，我让他只为我们提供堂食，天天给我们做饭。
I asked my friend to help me. He opened a noodle shop near the supermarket. I asked him to provide us with a meal and cook for us every day.
想尽了办法，也就几个人能正常工作了。
By all means, a few people were able to work properly.
▲我的合伙人也在送货虽然客流量只有平时的四分之一，但是这么几个怎么够？我老婆说，她来当收银员吧。
My partner is delivering a quarter as much traffic as usual, but how is that enough? My wife says she'll be the cashier.
其他几个股东也说，他们也可以当收银员，还可以送货、理货，反正干什么都可以。
Several other shareholders said they could also work as cashiers and deliver goods and tally goods, whatever they did.
这样我们最大的超市总算是凑了十个人。
So our biggest supermarket finally got ten people together.
我也开着我的路虎开始送货。
I'm driving my Land Rover, too.
平时配送有第三方，现在他们也不干了，我们不送哪个送？昨天我开了二十多公里到老余杭，那边的几十户居民反映，说附近几公里都没有超市，生活必需品买不到，我拉了一车过去，远远放在他们小区门口，打了个招呼就走了。
Yesterday, I drove more than twenty kilometers to Old Yuhang, where dozens of families reported that there was no supermarket in the vicinity for a few kilometers and the necessities of life could not be bought.
我们配送不加一分钱，今天我们努力，明天大家才更认可我们。
We do not send a penny distribution, today we work hard, tomorrow we will be more recognized.
02疫情改变销售模式，现在很多人在群里下单我跟员工说，我们XX店是我们这块区域两万多居民生活的唯一核心保障，我们要守住。
The epidemic has changed the sales pattern, now a lot of people in the group order I told the staff that our XX shop is the only core guarantee of the lives of more than 20,000 residents of our region, we have to hold on.
这不是夸张，附近另外一家大超市已经关门了，其他小超市也都关了。
It is no exaggeration to say that the other big supermarket in the neighborhood is closed, as are all the other small ones.
前几天，有关领导来我们这，鼓励我们克服困难。
A few days ago, leaders came to us to encourage us to overcome our difficulties.
领导说，店不能关，而且还要每天做好消毒工作，要给顾客测体温。
The leader said that the shop could not be closed, but also had to do a good daily disinfection work, to take temperature test for customers.
我也想啊，可是消毒液我都已经买不到了。
I'd love to, but I can't get the disinfectant.
我甚至还想给员工们弄几套防护服，我们都算是高危人群。
I even want to get some protective clothing for my employees, we're all at high risk.
可是哪里又能搞得到？我天天开店，天天都在想，这就是赌啊。
But where can I get it? I open a shop every day, every day think, this is gambling.
赌我们的员工都健康，赌我们的顾客都健康。
Gamble that all our employees are healthy and our customers are healthy.
这里面只要有一个人出了问题，我们的超市就不得不关门了。
If only one of us had a problem, our supermarket would have to close.
我不敢想万一员工出事了，我要怎么去面对他们，面对他们的家庭。
I didn't dare to think how I would face them and their families if something happened to the staff.
为了减少这方面的风险，我们开始劝顾客不要来超市了，在朋友圈发消息、在微信群提醒大家——别来，都别来，你们要什么，我们送，再晚也送，连轴转没得休息也送。
In order to reduce the risk of this, we began to persuade customers not to go to the supermarket, in the circle of friends, in the micro-message group to remind everyone - do not come, do not come, what you want, we send, late delivery, even without rest.
这就是“非接触购物”，谁也不接触谁最好，最安全。
This is "non-contact shopping," no one contact who is the best, the safest.
我们超市以前也有外送业务，顾客通过外卖平台下单，由那些平台的外卖小哥来配送。
Our supermarket also used to have outsourcing business, customers through the take-out platform order, by those platforms of delivery younger brother to distribute.
疫情来了，外卖小哥也不送了。
The outbreak's coming, and the little takeout guy's gone.
我们就让顾客在群里下单，我们自己送。
We let our customers order in the group and we deliver them ourselves.
我们本来就有建群，附近小区每个小区建一个，有十来个。
We originally have a group, the neighborhood to build a small area, there are about a dozen.
之前只是发布下我们的货品消息，现在成了顾客下订单的渠道。
Before just released our goods news, now it has become the customer to place the order channel.
▲我们按照小区，一个个建群，居民在群里预订之前每个群人不多，有的就几十个人。
We follow the community, build a group, residents in the group before booking a small number of people, some dozens of people.
现在告知大家可以在群了买东西了，每个群规模都迅速扩大，大家互相拉人，每个群都有几百号人了。
Now that you're ready to shop in the group, each group is expanding rapidly, and people pull each other, each group has a few hundred people.
我们告诉大家，在群里头接龙，把要买的东西、住址、电话都写清楚，我们按照小区统一集中配送到小区门口，大家再分批来自取。
We told people to pick up the dragon in the group, to buy things, address, telephone all clear, we in accordance with the unified distribution to the community door, we batch from.
目前我们的货品相比一些买菜APP，算是比较全的，价格也相对实惠。
At present, our products compared with some shopping APP, is relatively complete, the price is also relatively affordable.
▲业主订的货物直接送货上门这场疫情会改变很多人的生活，我想我们的销售模式也会迎来巨大改变。
Owners order goods delivered directly to the door This epidemic will change the lives of many people, I think our sales model will usher in a great change.
我们自己的力量有限，希望政府在推动“非接触购物”方面也能给到我们一定支持。
Our own strength is limited, and we hope that the government can also give us support in promoting "non-contact shopping."
过几天，可能我们的超市也不开门了，全部送货上门。
After a few days, perhaps our supermarket also closed, all delivery door.
供货渠道越来越少，菜农宁可把菜烂在地里，不出门困难还远不止这些。
Fewer and fewer supply channels, vegetable farmers would rather rotten vegetables in the field, do not go out more than these difficulties.
我们不知道疫情什么时候结束，外地的员工什么时候能回来，不能回来他们的工资也还是要发，肯定要发。
We do not know when the outbreak will end, when the field staff will be able to come back, their salaries will still be paid, sure to send.
剩下的几个员工，现在都是几倍工资，而且一天上十二个小时班，也不知道能撑多久。
The remaining employees, now several times their salaries and working twelve hours a day, did not know how long they would last.
这些咬咬牙就算都能克服，我们的上游渠道也越来越窄了。
Even if it can be overcome, our upstream channels are getting narrower.
多多是我们的采购，这些天都是他开车去采购蔬菜。
Dodo is our shopping. He's been driving around these days shopping for vegetables.
多多跟我说，跟以往蔬菜批发市场是24小时不休的，物流进进出出，连车都没地方停。
Tell me more, with the past wholesale vegetable market is 24-hour, logistics in and out, even the car no place to stop.
现在就只开夜里三四个小时，来采购的也稀稀拉拉几个人，市场凌晨1点开，4点多就完全没人了。
Only three or four hours into the night, a few people come to buy, the market opens at 1: 00 am, more than 4: 00 completely empty.
很多菜农宁可把菜烂在地里，不去割，绝不出门。
Many vegetable farmers would rather rot in the ground than cut and never go out.
安吉的笋、建德的草莓，都是这样，很多都要烂掉。
Angie's bamboo shoots, Jiande's strawberries, are all like this, many have to rot.
市场能收到的菜越来越少。
The market is getting less and less food.
以往多多去采购，市场有100多家供应商，现在不到四成开着。
In the past, the market has more than 100 suppliers, now less than 40% open.
开一小会儿他们就关了，因为要赶着回家去。
They shut up in a little while, for they had to hurry home.
他们绝大多数都租住在市场旁边，房东们说，要是回来晚了，就别想进门。
Most of them live next to the market, and landlords say they won't come in late.
还有的房东说，别出去做生意了，房子我给你们免费住。
And some landlords said, do not go out to do business, I give you a house for free.
我们的蔬菜供货商，以前有很稳定的40家，现在正常运营的只有15家左右。
Our vegetable supplier, which used to have a stable number of 40, now operates only about 15.
以前还能挑挑拣拣，现在只能是谁还开着就去谁那里拿货。
It used to be a pick-and-choose thing, but now it's just who's left to pick it up.
菜都比较贵，按照往年初七初八蔬菜价格已经回落，恢复正常了。
Food is more expensive, in accordance with the eighth day of the previous year prices have fallen back to normal.
现在普遍上浮了40%左右，尤其是叶子菜。
Now it's about 40% above sea level, especially for leafy vegetables.
不止是蔬菜市场。
It's not just the vegetable market.
这几天我们去进货，冷冻市场已经关掉了，干货市场只有30%开着，水果市场一大半都不做生意了，连肉都是。
We went shopping in the last few days, the frozen market was closed, the dry market was only 30% open, and more than half the fruit market was closed, even meat.
过去市场一天拉十车的猪肉来，分给我们这种采购商，现在一天就拉一车猪肉，你说怎么能不贵呢？我们担心，再持续下去，供货商会越来越少，供应能力一步步衰竭。
In the past, the market used to pull ten carts of pork a day to buyers like us, and now it pulls a load of pork in a day.
到时候我们想开店都拿不到货了。
We won't be able to get them when we want.
像我们都拿不到货，老百姓没米没盐没菜了该怎么办？记录平凡而普通的人生你“在看”我吗？点一下让我知道。
Like we can not get the goods, common people no rice no salt no vegetables? Record ordinary and ordinary life you "see" me? Click to let me know.
