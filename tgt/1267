系列报道 | 阴影起先很远，然后很近，最终和每一个人息息相关。
The shadow at first was distant, then close, and ultimately relevant to everyone.
记录改变中的全球文化图景。
Record the changing global cultural landscape.
从今天起，我们将围绕全国疫情进行为期两周的报道。
Starting today, we will report on the national epidemic for two weeks.
自 1 月 20 日新冠肺炎全面进入公共视野以来，编辑部除了密切留意疫情和它带来的人间悲喜剧外，也试图以我们擅长的角度，小切口地观察这场几乎洗刷了 2019 年国家基调的灾情。
Since January 20, when Newcastle Pneumonia entered public view, the editorial office, in addition to keeping a close eye on the epidemic and the human tragedy it brings, has tried to take a small incision at the disaster, which has almost swept the tone of the country in 2019.
最终，我们选择了 6 篇「个人志」和 5 篇「文本重读」来构成这一轮连续报道。
In the end, we chose six "personal blogs" and five "textual stresses" to make up this continuous reporting cycle.
关于前者，无论是返乡后遭遇不同程度疫情的年轻人 —— 他们虽和新冠肺炎保持着安全距离，却也无可避免地卷入其间，牵一发而动全身地体验着它的恐怖；抑或自发募集物资的摇滚乐队主唱—— 出于某种责任感，出于某种理性和激情，也出于某种不信任；以及被及时隔离、获得救治的普通人，都在竭力用自己的方式记录他们剧烈起伏的心理轨迹，和他们眼中构成今日中国的毛细血管。
With regard to the former, whether young people who have returned home with varying degrees of disease - inevitably involved in the horror of keeping a safe distance from Newcrown Pneumonia, or rock bands that spontaneously collect supplies - out of some sense of responsibility, some reason, some sort of distrust; and the ordinary people, isolated and treated in their own way, are struggling to record their dramatic psychological trajectories and the capillaries that make up China today.
这样一群执笔人，有的是专业记者，有的是律师，有的是初入职场不久的、从未想过要动笔写下自己故事的年轻女孩儿，他们从疫情中看到了属于这一代人的苦难（甚至只是苦难之一），但同时，他们也描摹了一张张在分崩离析中保持了人的尊严、生命的秩序、内心的归属的面孔。
Such a group of writers, some professional journalists, some lawyers, some recent young girls who have never thought of writing their own stories, see the suffering of this generation (or even just one of them) from the epidemic, but at the same time they depict faces that have preserved human dignity, the order of life, the place of belonging in the midst of disintegration.
我们感谢他们的加入。
We thank them for joining us.
而关于后者，我们的写作者将借助经典文本，去思辨这场肺炎疫情带来的隐喻和不确定性，去讨论集体的精神状况，去赞美被博尔赫斯称之为最重要的书写特质—— 英勇。
With regard to the latter, our authors will draw on classic texts to examine the metaphor and uncertainty of the pneumonia epidemic, to discuss the state of the collective spirit, and to celebrate what Borges calls the most important writing trait: heroism.
诗人帕斯捷尔纳克曾经在《二月》里形容，那是一个「墨水足够用来痛哭」的时代，但和痛哭相比，我们更倾向于给 2020年的春天一个理由，让它不至于被黑色的火焰燃烧殆尽。
The poet Pasternak once described it in February as an age of "enough ink to cry," but we tend to give the 2020 spring a reason not to be consumed by black flames, compared to crying.
它应当有春天的样子。
It should look like spring.
和战斗在一线的媒体同仁相比，我们所做的这一切实在是微不足道。
Compared to our media colleagues on the front lines, what we have done is really insignificant.
但正如我们在跨年夜的微博上所言，我们希望《T》中文版不缺席：这是我们不缺席的方式，这也是我们不忘记的方式。
But as we said on the big microblog, we want the Chinese version of T to be present: it is the way we are not absent, and that is the way we do not forget.
今天的推送是一篇「个人志」，一个武汉的幸运儿在感恩自己和自己的家族「虎口脱险」，尽管这一切尚且只是暂时。
Today's push is a "personal blog," in which a lucky man in Wuhan thanked himself and his family for "getting out of trouble," albeit temporarily.
我是 1 月 19 号回的武汉，戴了一个黑色的无纺布口罩，没什么用，但总比没有强。
I was back in Wuhan on January 19th, wearing a black non-woven mask, not useful, but better than no.
车厢是沙丁鱼罐头，但沙丁鱼都光着脸，下火车人潮汹涌，也都光着脸。
The car was tinned sardines, but the sardines were all barefaced, and there was a rush of people from the train, all naked.
我妈来接我，一张无畏的脸袒露在空气里，生气，觉得事情不应当是这样的。
My mother came to meet me, a fearless face exposed in the air, angry that this should not be the case.
这一天，武汉市民依旧没有预防新型冠状病毒肺炎的认识，大家照常出行，从事生产和劳作。
This day, Wuhan city people still did not prevent the new coronavirus pneumonia awareness, everyone as usual travel, engaged in production and labor.
个中原因在此不表，表起来没完没了。
The reasons for this are not in the table here, the table endless.
总之，我花了大量精力和爸妈吵架，劝他们当回事，一度搞得自己咽喉肿痛，不晓得如此自损八百伤敌一千是为了什么 —— 然而没有口罩是个大问题，我很焦虑。
Anyway, I spent a lot of time arguing with my parents and trying to convince them to take it seriously. At one point I got sore throat and wondered what I was doing to hurt eight hundred enemies so much - but the lack of a mask was a big problem and I was worried.
事急从权，20 号我在表哥指挥下拖着我妈去药店买口罩，将店里最后 8 个医用外科口罩包圆。
In a hurry, on the 20th, under my cousin's command, I dragged my mother to the drugstore to buy a mask, wrapping the last eight medical surgical masks around it.
我妈还觉得我反应过激，问店员：现在买口罩的人很多吗？店员摇头。
My mother thought I was overreacting and asked the clerk, Is there a lot of people buying masks now? The clerk shook his head.
她一副胜利者的姿态看向我。
She looked at me victorious.
现在当然是买不到口罩了。
You can't buy a mask now, of course.
我表哥是最早警觉的那一批人，早早地备好了 N95，并雪中送炭一家分了 5 个。
My cousin is the first alert group, early prepared the N95, and the family in the snow sent 5.
22 号我们年前最后一次相聚，取消拜年计划，交换消毒水和免洗洗手液的相关信息，那时候这些物资也很难买到了。
We met 22 years ago for the last time to cancel our New Year's Eve visits and exchange information about disinfectant and hand sanitizers, which were hard to get.
他四处跑超市，在各种线上平台扒存货，嘱咐他固执的老爹戴口罩一万遍，不厌其烦，脾气比我好得多。
He ran around the supermarket, picking his inventory on various online platforms and telling his stubborn old man to wear a mask ten thousand times.
家里有这样一个人真叫人安心。
It's reassuring to have such a person at home.
他无意识地担负起照顾全家人的责任，且落实到采买细节当中，开车来给家人送口罩，结果车还被撞了。
Unconsciously, he took on the responsibility of caring for his family, and in the details of the purchase, drove to give his family a mask and the car was hit.
那一天是我们家惯例的备年货日。
That day is the traditional New Year's Day in our family.
年货无非就是炸肉丸、炸藕夹一类的东西，今年做得少，想着没人拜年；等到后来没菜吃的时候又后悔怎么不多做一点，「猫耳朵」都没炸，见鬼。
New Year's food is nothing more than fried meatballs, lotus root sandwiches and other things, this year to do less, think no one visited the New Year; when there was no food and regret how little to do, "cat ears" did not blow up, damn it.
也是在那一天，我们全家对于「新冠」的认知终于空前统一：会死人。
It was also the day when our whole family finally came to terms with the new crown: death.
感谢钟南山院士，使武汉人真正开始警觉起来。
Thanks to the academician Zhong Nan Shan, Wuhan people really began to be alert.
第二天我爸自动自觉去药店买了一盒医用口罩，50 个。
The next day, my father went to the drugstore and bought 50 medical masks.
这是迄今为止我们买到的最后一盒口罩了。
This is the last box of masks we've bought so far.
物资缺乏在先，然后是焦虑。
Lack of supplies first, then anxiety.
确诊人数迅速涨起来，一个省一个省侵吞过去。
The number of confirmed cases rose rapidly, with province by province encroaching on the past.
武汉封城的消息发出之时我还没睡，我对着手机，心里说不上来是什么感觉。
Wuhan sealed the news when I was not asleep, I looked at the mobile phone, the heart can not say is what feeling.
早知道会走到这一步，真正到了这一步人又出奇平静：它是一件很遥远的事情，却又切切实实在当下发生了。
It was a strange calm at this stage, long ago, that it was a far-off thing, but it actually happened in the present moment.
这种分裂感将我架在半空，不晓得最终会去向哪里。
This sense of division holds me aloft, not knowing where I will end up.
我妈睡不着，光顾着叫我睡，我告诉她武汉封城了。
My mother can not sleep, patronize call me to sleep, I told her Wuhan closed the city.
她「啊」了一声。
She let out a cry.
半小时后她来到我房间：你从哪里看到的消息？我举起手机给她看。
Half an hour later she came to my room: Where did you see it? I held up my cell phone and showed it to her.
她眯着眼睛看了一会儿，没说话。
She squinted for a moment, but said nothing.
年三十我们在家看春晚，我很恍惚，感到电视里和现实中是两个世界。
We watched the Spring Festival Gala at home, I was very trance, feel in TV and reality is two worlds.
一切都彻底安静下来。
Everything was completely quiet.
有天夜晚我躺在床上，总觉得哪里不对，仔细一想，是街上已经没有车的声音了。
One night when I was lying in bed, I felt something was wrong. On second thought, there was no car in the street.
现实的问题又到眼前。
The real problem is here again.
菜涨价了，这是当然，不敢出门买水果，橘子数着吃。
The price of vegetables, this is of course, dare not go out to buy fruit, orange counting to eat.
每个人都在算自己的存货能吃几天，什么时候又必须出门补货。
Everyone is counting how many days they can eat from their stock and when they have to go out and replenish it.
姨妈打来视频电话聊天，说你姨爹吃得太多了！叫他晚饭吃少一点结果又要吃宵夜，那还不如不吃晚饭么！我心想，这真是勒紧裤腰带过日子。
My aunt called with a video to chat that your uncle had eaten too much! I thought it would be better if he had less dinner and would have supper instead of supper.
表哥出去补了一趟货，一口气买了 900块钱。
Cousin went out to make up a shipment and bought 900 yuan in one go.
我妈大惊：买什么东西能买出 900块？我说他吃上火锅了，他很快乐。
My mom freaked out: What can buy 900 bucks? I said he ate the hot pot. He was happy.
我们是最幸运的一批人，我们的问题也就是这样一些问题：无聊，不能散步，省着吃饭，没了。
We are the luckiest people, and our problems are the same: boredom, no walking, no meals, no more.
与真正辛苦、真正艰难的人相比，我们的抱怨简直是一种奢侈的抱怨。
Our complaints are a luxury complaint compared to those who are really hard-working and really hard-pressed.
这期间还有一则我发烧的小插曲，低烧，带点干咳，全家神经紧绷，你几乎可以看到一根细细的弦悬在头顶，随时等着发出响动。
There was also a feverish episode, low fever, dry coughing, family tension, you could almost see a thin string hanging over your head, ready to make a noise.
我爸不愿意跟我隔离，认为我们小题大做，他甚至一大清早在我房间窗台上压腿，把我气笑了。
My father didn't want to be separated from me and thought we were making a fuss. He even pushed his leg on the windowsill of my room early in the morning and made me laugh.
但我理解他的心理。
But I understand his mind.
有时候人就是不能往坏的方面想，他宁愿把这个选项从脑子里划掉，因为它导向的结果是难以承受的。
Sometimes people just can't think of the bad. He would rather cross the option out of his head because it leads to an unbearable result.
我每天给我的表哥播报体温，吃了睡睡了吃，从来没有如此积极规律地服药过。
I broadcast my cousin's body temperature every day, ate and slept, and never took medicine so regularly.
姨妈发微信鼓励我，说你不怕啊？我说「不怕」。
My aunt gave me a little encouragement and said you were not afraid? I said "no fear."
但怎么会不怕呢？有许多人正在承受这些。
But how can you be afraid? There are many people who are suffering from this.
我高中同学的父亲被医院下了病危，我爸的同事也因为「新冠」过世。
My high school classmate's father was taken to the hospital and my father's colleague died because of the new crown.
阴影逐渐扩大，向每一个人生活的圈子紧逼，起先很远，然后很近，最终和每个人息息相关。
The shadow gradually widens, pressing into the circle of everyone's life, first far away, then close, and ultimately relevant to everyone.
很难受，除了难受无力再说不出更多。
Very uncomfortable, but unable to say more than hard to bear.
能帮则帮，然而个人的力量终究是渺小的。
Can help others, but the power of the individual is ultimately small.
家人病危，求助无门 —— 这是实打实的痛苦，这种痛苦令我羞愧，好像我因此产生的痛像塑料制品，一种轻飘飘的污染物。
My family was dying and there was no way to help - it was real pain, and it made me feel ashamed, as if the pain I had caused was like plastic, a light pollutant.
但我们必须直视这些，不能撇过脸去。
But we have to look straight at them and not look away.
前几天晚 8 点，武汉许多小区自发喊起武汉加油，我们把窗户打开听，各种声音汇聚在一起，顺着冷风从客厅这头灌到那头。
A few days ago at 8 p.m., Wuhan, many communities spontaneously called up to cheer, we opened the windows, the voices gathered together, along the cold wind from the end of the living room to the other.
那时候我在看《太阳照常升起》，电影正好放到结尾，周韵也在喊，别害怕，他一笑太阳就出来了。
At that time, I was watching "The Sun Also Rises." The movie was just at the end. Zhou Yun was shouting, "Don't be afraid.
我向来不吃集体行为这一套，但到了这种紧要关头，一种粗糙的、主动的、悲哀的感动突然升起。
I had never been in the habit of collective action, but at such a critical juncture a coarse, active, sad movement suddenly arose.
我被它攫获了。
It gripped me.
形式严峻。
The form is grim.
但还要保持乐观。
But remain optimistic.
好像中国人一直是这样过来的。
It's as if the Chinese have been through this all along.
我们家附近有片小湖，我爸总喜欢去湖边散步。
There is a small lake near our house. My father always likes to go for a walk by the lake.
自他同事因「新冠」过世以来，他再没提过去湖边散步的事情。
Since his colleague died of the new crown, he has never mentioned taking a walk by the lake.
他上班的时间已经延到 2 月 14 号，可能还有变动，现在他正对着疫情实时新闻播报嗑瓜子。
His work has been postponed until Feb. 14, and there may be changes, now he is broadcasting the Kegua Zi on live news of the outbreak.
今天下午我们站在窗边，看小区的猫在地上打滚，阳光还行，白玉兰甚至已经结苞了。
This afternoon we stood by the window, watching the neighborhood cat rolling on the ground, the sun is still okay, white magnolia has even bud.
立春要来了。
Spring is coming.
希望好消息和立春一起来。
I hope good news and spring together.
