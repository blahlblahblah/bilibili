作者 | 第一财经段倩倩比春运期间高铁票更难买的东西，是新型冠状病毒蔓延时期的口罩。
A more difficult thing to buy at Qian Qian than a high-speed rail ticket during the Spring Festival, is a mask for the new coronavirus.
柳依依对此深有体会。
Liuyi knows this very well.
她休了年假，1月16日就从平时工作的深圳回了河北老家。
She took her annual leave and returned to her hometown of Hebei on January 16 from Shenzhen, where she usually works.
春运期间的高铁票难抢，可她还是回到了家。

在柳依依看来，高铁票不过如此，口罩比高铁票更难买，尤其是N95口罩。
In Liuyi's view, high-speed rail tickets, such as masks are more difficult to buy than high-speed tickets, especially N95 masks.

不仅是线上，线下药店口罩同样难买。
Not only online, but also offline drugstore masks are hard to buy.
22日下午，第一财经走访河北邯郸市部分药房，N95口罩普遍断货，有药店表示N95接受预定，晚上能到货，售价为25元一只。
22 afternoon, the first financial visit to the Hebei Handan City pharmacy, N95 masks generally out of stock, some pharmacies said N95 to accept reservations, evening can be delivered, the price is $25.

The multi-market watchdog authorities in Guangdong, Jiangxi and Beijing have said they require retail pharmacies to put a price on their prices and not follow the trend.
柳依依对第一财经表示，如果没有休年假，自己就不会回家了——正常情况下她1月22日才能回家，在病毒传播的压力下，那些没有休年假的同事，很多退掉了返家的车票或机票。
Without annual leave, she told First Finance that she would not be home until January 22, when many colleagues who did not take annual leave returned home.
22日晚间，柳依依所在城市的多家药房口罩被抢空，她知道自己晚了一步。
On the evening of May 22, she knew she was a little late after several pharmacy masks were emptied in her city.

"Some businesses do not raise prices, but after the Spring Festival will be shipped, as the situation was a year ago, not necessarily goods, buy more in case some stores do not deliver goods.
”柳依依对买不到口罩的恐惧超过了买不到高铁票。
Liuyi's fear of not buying masks outweighed her inability to buy high-speed rail tickets.
和每一个人一样，她期待不戴口罩就能出门的日子。
Like everyone else, she expects to be able to go out without a mask.
