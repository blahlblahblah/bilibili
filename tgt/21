王晓又要离开家了，在武汉正式封城的第五天。
Wang Xiao will leave home again, in Wuhan officially closed the fifth day of the city.
离家前，母亲感觉到他的坐立不安，嘴里一直念叨着：“走来走去的这是干啥？不能消停点儿吗？”她知道儿子又要出去搞事情了，只是一听到“武汉”两字心里还是咯噔一下。
Before he left home, his mother felt his restlessness and kept saying, "What is this walking around for? Can't you stop?" She knew her son was going out again, just clattering in her heart when she heard the word Wuhan.
从1月20日开始，王晓开始关注新型冠状病毒肺炎，他恨不得24小时盯着手机刷消息。
From January 20, Wang Xiao began to pay attention to the new coronavirus pneumonia, he would like to stare at the mobile phone brush message 24 hours.
后来，他通过各类渠道，加入了武汉物资对接群。
Later, he joined Wuhan Materials Docking Group through various channels.
群里实时滚动发布一线告急的相关信息，他再也坐不住了：“没想到物资可以匮乏到这种地步，那么多医护人员缺乏最起码的防护？正在前线‘裸奔’？简直无法想象！”行动疫情爆发初期，各大渠道的口罩已出现脱销的趋势，王晓把给儿子准备的压岁钱拿来抢了1500只医用外科口罩，顺丰快递到武汉大学中南医院。
He couldn't wait: "Didn't expect supplies to be so scarce, so many health care workers lacked even the most rudimentary protection? We were running 'naked' on the front lines." At the beginning of the outbreak, major channels were running out of masks.
随着形势越来越严峻，他觉得是时候要大规模调集物资亲赴武汉了，而且越快越好。
As the situation became more and more serious, he felt it was time to send materials to Wuhan on a large scale, and the sooner the better.
■ 1月27日18：56分王晓开启地图准备出发。
:: 27 January 1856 hours Wang Xiao opens the map for departure.
1月27日（大年初三）傍晚，王晓戴着口罩，拉着满满一车自筹丁腈医用防护手套，以及一桶康师傅红烧牛肉面加六罐红牛，独自从山东淄博出发了。
January 27 (New Year's Day) evening, Wang Xiaoxiao wearing a mask, pulling a full load of self-designed butyronitrile medical protective gloves, as well as a bucket of master red-roasted beef noodle plus six cans of red bull, alone from Zibo Shandong Province.
“出发前儿子非要和我一起去，我团队的其他人也盯着副驾驶的位置，我才不带他们，你看看这有限的空间，多带一个人少拉多少箱手套啊，你说是不是？”这次购买医疗专用手套的善款，全部来自于团队的募捐，以及身边爱心人士的资助，捐赠数额为126208元。
My son insisted on going with me before he left, and the rest of my team stared at the copilot, and I didn't take them with me. Look at this limited space and take one more person to pull more boxes of gloves, don't you think?
“太难搞到了，哪儿哪儿都缺。
"It's hard to get it. It's missing everywhere.
”王晓托了私人关系，才联系到这批符合医用标准且证书齐全的手套，同时能以对公打入厂家账户的形式交易，统一开具发票留存，这一切保证了物资的交接流程合法正规。
It was only through personal contacts that Wang was able to contact the medically compliant and fully certified gloves and to issue invoices in the form of public access to manufacturers' accounts, all of which ensured that the handover process was legal and regular.
一桶泡面生扛40小时1月28日上午，经过15个小时的长途跋涉，王晓抵达武汉，在高速路口与之前联络到的几名志愿者做交接。
On the morning of January 28, after a 15-hour trek, Wang Xiao arrived in Wuhan, where he made the transition to several volunteers he had previously contacted.
来交接的是几名年轻利索的男生，大家都戴着口罩，谁也看不清谁的表情，不知对方长什么模样，大家就是迅速干自己手里的活，见了面也没有多余的寒暄。
The hand-over was made up of several young, shrewd boys, all wearing masks; no one could make out their faces, and no one knew what the other looked like.
随后，这15万副手套按照流程陆续分发到武汉儿童医院、武汉大学中南医院、湖北谷城第二人民医院等七所医院。
The 150,000 pairs of gloves were then distributed to seven hospitals, including Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and Hubei Valley City Second People's Hospital.
从淄博出发到物资送到武汉当地医院，王晓只用了不到20个小时。
From Zibo departure to the materials sent to Wuhan local hospital, Wang Xiao only in less than 20 hours.
完成一系列交接工作后，王晓在群里和大家报平安，有人说“武汉人民感谢你”。
After completing a series of hand-over work, Wang Xiaoxiao and everyone in the group reported peace, someone said, "Wuhan people thank you."
随后，王晓从车里拿出给自己准备的一桶泡面，热水一冲，调料的香味扑鼻而来，早已饥肠辘辘的王晓开始狼吞虎咽。
Then Wang took out a bucket of noodles for himself from the car, washed it with hot water, and the smell of the spices filled his nose.
这距王晓的上一顿饭已经间隔将近20小时，吃完泡面，他马上返回淄博，路上又是15个小时，这一桶泡面生扛了40个小时。
Wang Xiao had nearly 20 hours before the last meal, after eating noodles, he immediately returned to Zibo, the road is another 15 hours, the bucket of noodles carried the 40 hours.
■ 40小时唯一的一餐：一盒方便面。
▪ 40 hours' sole meal: a box of instant noodles.
返回被隔离从山东到湖北往返近2000公里的路程，王晓加了六次油，每次在河南境内小憩半小时。
Returning to the isolated distance of nearly 2,000 kilometers from Shandong to Hubei, Wang Xiaoxiao took six trips and rested for half an hour in Henan province.
一路不停循环两首歌：阿冗的《你的答案》，还有朴树的《平凡之路》；一边听着“打破一切恐惧我能找到答案”，一边看着群里不断传来的消息和图片泪流满面。
I could find an answer while listening to "Breaking Through All Fear I Can Find an Answer" as I watched as tears welled up in the crowd.
返程的途中，王晓接到多个来自志愿者和记者的电话，询问武汉一线的情况以及返回山东后的安排，“一路上聊的都是疫情这些事，也没什么机会和家人通太久的话。
On the way back, Wang Xiao received many telephone calls from volunteers and journalists inquiring about the Wuhan railway line and the arrangements for his return to Shandong.
还好家人已经习惯自己这么多年一直在东奔西跑，这次也只是在路上打个电话，报个平安罢了。
Fortunately, the family has been used to their so many years have been running around, this time only to make a phone call on the road, just a safe.
”他原本打算在淄博站服务区和团队兄弟交接物资，再直接返回武汉。
"He had intended to Zibo station service areas and the team brother hand over supplies, and then directly back to Wuhan.
然而，此时山东已启动重大突发公共卫生事件一级响应，凡是湖北来淄博人员不论什么原因，都需按照规定隔离两周观察。
However, at this time Shandong has launched a major public health emergency first-level response, Hubei Zibo personnel whatever the reason, need to be isolated in accordance with the regulations for two weeks observation.
“抱歉，我失信了”，他在志愿者群里告诉大家已经平安返回，接下来只能远程帮大家筹集应急物资。
"I'm sorry, I broke my word," he told the volunteers that they had returned safely, and then had to raise emergency supplies remotely.
赶回淄博后，王晓只想狠狠睡一觉，等第二天30万副手套生产出来，再第一时间联系物流发往武汉。
rushed back to Zibo, Wang Xiaoshui only want to soundly sleep, such as the next day 30 million pairs of gloves produced, and the first time contact logistics sent to Wuhan.
“因为物资越来越紧缺，一刻都耽误不起。
"Because of the increasing shortage of supplies, can not afford to delay a moment.
”相信老天不会惩罚善良的人1982年的王晓，是山东淄博一名拥有九年军龄的老兵，2009年退伍后，从事煤炭铁路物流运输工作至今。
"Believe that God will not punish the good man Wang Xiao in 1982, Shandong Zibo is a nine-year-old veteran, retired in 2009, engaged in coal railway logistics transport work to date.
最初接触到公益，是因2008年汶川地震，他以志愿者的身份亲赴一线，所到之处满目疮痍，他的内心受到极大的震撼。
He first came into contact with the public welfare, because of the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, he went to the front as a volunteer, everywhere he went, his heart was greatly shocked.
回到家乡，他火线成立山东老兵公益助学志愿者服务队，以帮助灾后的孩子们继续上学。
Back home, he set up Shandong Veterans Volunteer Service Corps to help children continue to go to school after the disaster.
从汶川地震至今，王晓和他的团队每年至少投入十几万做公益项目，这些公益款大都来自煤炭物流板块，据王晓介绍，他每年在这一板块的收入已达上百万，足以支撑其做公益。
Since the Wenchuan earthquake, Mr. Wang and his team have spent at least tens of thousands of dollars a year on projects that benefit the public, mostly from the coal-logistics sector, where Mr. Wang says he earns millions of dollars a year to support public goods.
王晓的儿子今年16岁，去年此时，他正带着儿子在武汉旅游，武汉大学是他们打卡的第一站。
This time last year, when Wang Xiao's son was 16, he was traveling with his son in Wuhan, Wuhan University was their first stop to punch a card.
“我实在太喜欢武大了，在校门口看着国立武汉大学这几个字就莫名激动，我告诉儿子一定要好好学习，以后上武大这样的知名学府。
"I really like Wuda, in front of the school looking at the state Wuhan University on these words inexplicably excited, I told my son must study hard, after WU such a well-known academic institutions.
”而2020年这一趟特殊的武汉之旅，王晓感慨颇深。
"And 2020 this special trip to Wuhan, Wang Xiao sigh deeply.
“医护人员太不容易了，我发自内心敬佩他们。
"The paramedics were not easy, and I admired them from the bottom of my heart.
出发前，我哥们儿说，你管好自己当地的医护人员就行了，去武汉凑什么热闹？我当即反驳，当地的医护人员会尿裤子吗？需要穿纸尿裤吗？也吃不上饭吗？他立马就闭嘴了。
Before we set out, my buddy said, "Just mind your local paramedics and go to Wuhan for a ride?" I retorted immediately. "Can the local paramedics pee their pants? Do they need to wear diapers? Can't they eat? He shut up immediately."
”■志愿者已将手套送到医院。
"▪ The volunteers have taken the gloves to the hospital.
王晓说，自己和战友都是平凡的人，他们做的也是些平凡事儿。
Wang said that he and his comrades-in-arms are ordinary people who do ordinary things.
从汶川地震到现在，凡是有灾难发生时，大伙都积极主动去做志愿者，就想贡献一份力量。
From Wenchuan earthquake to now, whenever a disaster occurs, everyone is active volunteers, would like to contribute to a strength.
他说自己不惧怕病毒，“我就是见到这种事就想往前冲的人。
He said he wasn't afraid of the virus. "I'm the one who wants to go forward when I see this.
我不怕感染，因为我相信老天不会惩罚善良的人。
I am not afraid of infection, because I believe that God will not punish good people.
”王晓还有一个朴素的愿望，希望儿子以后能成为医生或律师，向钟南山院士一样，从事一份可以帮助到他人的职业，做一个对社会有用的人。
Wang Xiao also had a simple wish that his son might become a doctor or lawyer, a career that would help others and be a useful person to society, just like a fellow Zhong Nan Shan.
当然，眼下最重要的是，疫情快点结束吧，大家都有好日子过。
