"Fear of what!" Ren Chao is 36 years old, is a native of Wuhan, a two-year compulsory soldier, is now a staff member of Wuhan University.
他跟朋友说，“都是成年人了，要脑中有科学，心中有道义。

When his mother disapproved, he made a clean breast of it. "I'm a Party member or a 'bachelor', I don't go, so let the tug go with me?" "Even if I 'hang up,' the Party and the state will take care of you and trust the Party and the state.
