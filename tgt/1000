Click on the above material life reference star! Material life reference source: Zhao Xiaowei Source: Material Life Reference (ID: wzshck) "Temporary Home Office" nail tips, let Liu Yun and her mother began a new round of relations.
在这之前，母女俩已经每日四目相对超过20天。
Before that, the mother and daughter had had four eyes a day for more than 20 days.
“每天都在‘要疯了’和‘坚持住’的心情间游走。
"Walking around every day in the mood of 'going crazy' and 'holding on.
”刘芸说。
"said Liu Yun.
“史上最长法定假期”、高校开学时间推迟、暂行居家办公政策......对于许多年轻人而言，疫情笼罩下的一系列操作，让这个创下了与父母朝夕相处最长纪录的冬春之交，注定不太平常。
"Maximum statutory holidays in history," delays in starting classes at colleges and universities, and a temporary home office policy... For many young people, the winter-spring break, the longest on record with their parents, is bound to be unusual.
01.朝夕相处后的第十天，刘芸与母亲爆发了第一次争吵。
The day after sunset, the first quarrel broke out between Liu Yun and her mother.
在一通不知打给老家哪位亲朋的微信电话里，母亲细数了女儿的种种不是，除了“不爱打扫卫生、不找男朋友、不会做饭”等常规抱怨外，还增加了一条“来了这么久了哪儿也没带我去！”母亲来北京是在春节前，按原计划，母女俩将在假期去往日本京都。
During a phone call to relatives and friends back home, the mother recounted her daughters faults, adding "I haven't taken me anywhere for so long." Mother came to Beijing just before the Spring Festival, when the mother and daughter were due to leave for Kyoto, Japan.
不料疫情席卷而来，刘芸与母亲退掉了票，留在北京。
Unexpectedly, the outbreak came, Liu Yun and her mother withdrew the ticket, stay in Beijing.
来自东北的母亲获取外界信息的手段主要是电视和微信，心中的权威信源只有新闻联播。
From the Northeast mothers to access external information mainly through television and micromail, the authoritative source of the heart only news broadcast.
因而很长一段时间，她都觉得女儿危言耸听。
So for a long time she felt alarmist about her daughter.
与许多同龄人一样，90后的刘芸为了让母亲少出门、戴口罩，做了大量包括劝说、恐吓在内的劝导工作，“非典后遗症的文章啊，中老年专用截图啊，都发了，但她就是不当回事。
Like many of her peers, the 90-year-old Liu Yun did a lot of persuasion, including persuasion and intimidation, to let her go out less, wearing masks, "the sequela of SARS articles, special screenshots for the elderly, ah, but she is not serious.
”刘芸抱怨说，“我想让她戴口罩比她想让我穿秋裤还难！”最终让母亲感到“情况严重了”，还是联播中每日上升的确诊数字。
"I thought it would be harder for her to wear a mask than she wanted me to wear autumn pants," complained Liu Yun.
两个人的活动范围就此局限于方圆300米之内，然而即便只是去楼下超市，母女俩也不免起冲突。
The movement of the two men was thus limited to a 300-metre radius, but even going downstairs to the supermarket would have caused a conflict between mother and daughter.
老字号的元宵30块钱20颗，之前强调“北方人还是要吃元宵”的母亲坚决不肯买，认为这是“坐地起价”。
The old name of the Lantern Festival 30 yuan 20, the previous stressed that "northerners or eat Lantern Festival" mother firmly refused to buy, as it is "sitting ground starting price."
与之相比，80后的胡青与父亲的争执原因，则显得更为“严肃”一些。
In contrast, the 80-year-old Hu Qing and his father's reasons for the dispute, appears to be more "serious".
“他看完美国流感新闻之后就放松了警惕，说，中国这新冠也没那么吓人吧？还没它流感死的人多！”重庆人的乐观天性瞬间得到释放，“甚至觉得不戴口罩就可以出门了！”胡青一时间火冒三丈。
"He relaxed his guard after reading the news of the American flu, saying that the new Chinese crown is not that scary, isn't it? There are not as many people dying of influenza as it is!" Chongqing's optimistic nature was released in a flash, "even thinking that he could go out without a mask!"
父女俩从防疫常识一路辩论到国际局势，“他赢了我也没输”，胡青说，自己作出了将电视频道选择权交给父亲的让步，交换条件是，对方减少出门次数，以及出门必戴口罩。
"I didn't lose when he won," Hu said, making the concession to give his father the choice in exchange for fewer trips and masks.
至于国际争端、政治走向，二人表示“暂时求同存异好了”。
As for international disputes, political trends, the two said that "temporary differences between the good."
事后胡青反思，平日自己与父母关系不错，争吵主要源于“相处时间超过警戒线”。
Afterward Hu Qing introspection, weekday oneself and the parents relations are good, bickering mainly stems from "get along with the time exceeds the police line".
大学毕业以来，这是她与父母相处时间最长的假期。
It was the longest time she had spent with her parents since graduating from college.
“时间就是矛盾的放大镜，特别考验人的意志品质。
Time is the magnifying glass of contradiction, which tests man's will especially.
”她说。
'she said.
“起早了，问你怎么不多睡会儿，起晚了，说你只知道睡觉。
"Get up early and ask why you don't sleep much. You get up late and say you only know how to sleep.
”胡青说，网上关于与父母相处的吐槽绝对不是段子，“那是我们的血泪教训！”两天前，胡青也接到公司了“居家办公、暂不通勤”的通知。
Hu Qing said the spit on the Internet about living with parents was definitely not a paragraph, "that is our blood and tears lesson!" Two days ago, Hu Qing also received the company's "telecommuting, temporary commuting" notice.
虽然可以回到自己的房子，但她还是选择继续与父母住在一起。
Although she could go back to her house, she chose to stay with her parents.
一个女孩追在殡仪馆车后大哭叫妈妈的视频看到她心碎，“生死面前，一切都是小事。
A girl chasing the undertaker's car and crying for her mother saw her heartbroken. "Life and death, everything is a small matter.
”胡青说，重庆目前情况也不明朗，还是一家人捆绑生活，心里比较安定。
The situation in Chongqing is also unclear, and the family is tied up and relatively calm, Hu said.
刘芸则与母亲度过了一个吃汤圆的元宵节。
Liu Yun spent a Lantern Festival with her mother.
她算了一下，这是自己毕业后第一次在元宵节吃到家常饭菜，这样一想，就觉得“汤圆也还不错”。
She calculated that this is the first time after graduation in the Lantern Festival to eat a home-cooked meal, so think, "Tang Yuan is also good.
02.大年初八，93年出生的王鹏在观看看电影《囧妈》时，几度热泪盈眶。
2.Peng Wang, born in 1993, watched the movie "Jung Ma," several times with tears in his eyes.
电影里，原本要去美国跟前妻争财产的徐伊万，阴差阳错地跟妈妈坐上了前往莫斯科的火车。
In the movie, Xu Yiwan, who was supposed to fight with his ex-wife for property in the United States, got on the train to Moscow with his mother by mistake.
六天六夜的行程中，男主角与母亲共处一个车厢。
During the six-day and six-night trip, the hero shared a carriage with his mother.
接受媒体采访时，导演兼编剧徐峥把这个故事描述为“灾难”。
In an interview with the media, director and screenwriter Xu Zheng described the story as a "disaster."
“如果你是一个成年男人，六天六夜跟自己的妈妈两个人在一个火车车厢里面，基本上我觉得是个灾难。
"If you're a grown man, six days and six nights in a railroad car with your mom, it's basically a disaster for me.
”他说。
'he said.
“我这都快两个六天六夜了，”王鹏痛苦地计算着日期。
"I have been here for almost two days and six nights," Wang Peng painfully calculated the date.
年前就回到黑龙江老家的他，已经创下成年后与父母日夜相处的最高纪录。
Back home in Heilongjiang City some years ago, he has set a record day and night with his parents as an adult.
火车上的所有故事情节，几乎都在这个漫长的春节里，与他和母亲的相处形成完美映射。
Almost all the stories on the train are perfectly mapped to his relationship with his mother during this long Spring Festival.
《囧妈》中，儿子吃什么水果、吃多少红烧肉、什么时候喝水排尿、怎样要孩子，全部在母亲周密计划之中；现实生活中，王鹏应吃是橘子还是苹果，要吃酸菜还是白肉，到底一天还是隔天洗头，也必须在母亲指挥下进行。
What kind of fruit do you eat, how much red meat you eat, when you drink water to urinate, and how to have children are all part of your mother's careful planning. In real life, whether Wang Peng should eat oranges or apples, eat sour or white meat, or wash his hair every other day, must also be done under the command of his mother.
“洗头弄湿了袖子，就被教育了一早上。
"Wash your hair and wet your sleeves, and you've been educated all morning.
”王鹏十分沮丧。
Peng Wang was very frustrated.
儿子洗头，母亲在旁边看着，对所有动作细节进行规范，这是他从小就熟悉的操作流程。
The son shampoo, the mother looked at the side, all the details of the action to standardize, this is his childhood familiar with the operation process.
在他回忆中，母亲的严格管控一以贯之，读什么书，上什么学校，吃什么菜，喝什么牛奶，交什么朋友，全部由母亲决定。
His mother, he recalls, had always exercised strict control over what books she read, what she went to school, what she ate, what she drank, and what friends she made.
毕业后在北京工作这几年，王鹏每年只在春节回老家。
Wang Peng returns home only in Spring Festival these years after graduation.
相处时间短，控制和改造很难形成规模，杀伤力相对有限。
Time together is short, control and transformation is difficult to form a scale, relatively limited lethality.
这一次，母亲又有了施展拳脚的机会，最近几天，甚至已经对他袜子的颜色提出了要求。
This time, the mother has the opportunity to display the boxing feet, in recent days, even on his socks color requirements.
困在山东淄博小村里的张晓，面临的是更为惨烈的“囧”境。
Trapped in the small village of Zibo in Shandong Province Zhang Xiao, is facing a more brutal "embarrassed" situation.
回到村里十几天，父亲的骂声几乎没有断过。
Back in the village for a few days, my father's scolding barely stopped.
不擦桌子会挨骂，不吃早饭会挨骂，熬夜写稿子也会挨骂。
You will be scolded for not cleaning the table, scolded for not eating breakfast, and scolded for staying up late to write.
“他嫌地板脏、嫌桌子脏，说家里还不如一个猪圈。
"He thinks the floor is dirty and the table dirty, and says the house is not as good as a pigsty.
”张晓满心委屈。
"Zhang Xiao felt aggrieved.
与王鹏一样，绝对权威和“打击式教育”，贯穿了张晓整个成长历程。
Like Wang Peng, absolute authority and "anti-type education", throughout Zhang Xiao's entire growth process.
从小被否认、被责骂的阴影至今挥之不去，张晓只好去求助心理医生，“去年做心理咨询就花了一万块，我每个月生活费才两千。
Zhang Xiao had to seek help from a psychiatrist. "Last year it cost 10,000 yuan for counseling, and I live on 2,000 yuan a month
”但王鹏的应对方式主要是“躲”。
But Wang Peng's coping style is mainly "hiding."
除了洗漱、吃饭等生活必须环节，他的活动地点基本局限于卧室。
In addition to washing, eating and other essential aspects of life, his activities are basically confined to the bedroom.
王鹏前所未有地希望早日复工，否则“心理防线快被击穿了”；而他最大胆的打算，是将《囧妈》推荐给母亲。
Wang Peng wants to get back to work as soon as possible, or "the psychological defense line is going to be breached"; and his boldest plan is to recommend "Jung Ma" to his mother.
但他对此又存有犹疑：“我怕她领会到的点不是‘不要控制太多’，而是‘你看人家事业多成功’或者‘你至少得先把婚结了’。
But he hesitated: "I'm afraid the point she learns is not 'Don't control too much,' but 'You see how successful people are in business' or 'You have to get married first.
”王鹏说。
"said Wang Peng.
03.也有些人与父母的关系，在非常时期实现了某种逆转。
03. There have also been some reversals in the relationship between parents in times of stress.
杨菲的爸妈在湖北孝感，情况恶化之前，她在家人催促下回到北京，开始自我隔离。
Yang Fei's parents in Hubei filial piety, before the situation deteriorated, she was urged back to Beijing by her family, began self-isolation.
虽然家人情况稳定、身体健康，但杨菲依旧时刻处于焦虑之中。
Although her family is stable and in good health, Yang Fei remains in constant anxiety.
“每天差不多要打十几个语音电话，”杨菲说，电话的内容大同小异，问问身体有没有状况，冰箱里的菜够不够。
"There are about a dozen voice calls a day," Yang said. The calls were much the same, asking if the body was in good condition and the food in the fridge was not enough.
每日上升的确诊数字让她紧张万分，几次下决心“再也不看了”，但还是忍不住要一刷再刷。
The daily rise in the number of confirmed cases made her nervous, several times determined to "never again", but could not help but to brush again.
因为家里已经没有口罩存货，快递又无法送达，杨菲要求父母不许出门。
With no masks in stock and no express delivery, Yang asked her parents not to go out.
怕爸妈不听话，她甚至开启了微信运动监视模式。
Fearing that her parents wouldn't listen, she even started the microphone movement surveillance mode.
“步数稍微多一点，我都要神经病一样过去盘问。
"With a little more steps, I'll cross-examine you like a neurotic.
”杨菲说。
"said Yang Fei.
这几乎是她与父母关系最为亲密的时刻。
It was almost the most intimate moment of her relationship with her parents.
春节之前，因为不断被催，杨菲几次想把母亲的微信拉黑，甚至一度赌气，准备与老公出国过节。
Before the Spring Festival, because constantly urged, Yang Fei several times want to pull her mother's micro-letter black, even for a time gamble, ready to go abroad with her husband for the holiday.
现在她部分理解了母亲的焦虑，因为自己现在“也很烦人”。
Now she partly understands her mother's anxiety, because she is now "very annoying," too.
前两天，父亲告知杨菲，家里青菜吃光了，准备去门口的菜场看看还有没有人卖菜。
Two days ago, my father told Yang Fei that he had eaten all his vegetables and was going to the market to see if anyone was selling vegetables.
杨菲吓坏了，一边晓之以理动之以情劝说他先靠储存的干货撑下去，一边紧急联络母亲，叮嘱她严防死守，绝对不允许父亲迈出门一步。
Yang Fei was so frightened that he tried to persuade him to hold on to the dry goods he had stored. He called her mother urgently and told her not to allow him to take a step.
前后不过半小时，杨菲发现自己嗓子急得完全哑了。
Within half an hour or so, Yang Fei found herself hoarse with eagerness.
同样，在这个春节来临之前，大龄单身的两姐妹李欣和李璐，已经被父母安排的相亲搞得不厌其烦。
Similarly, before the Spring Festival, older single sisters Li Xin and Li Lu, have been arranged by their parents have been engaged in matchmaking.
姐妹俩的策略是将父母接到北京，然后以全家度假的方式转移催婚压力。
The sisters' strategy was to take their parents to Beijing and then divert the pressure from marriage by taking a family holiday.
虽然哪儿也没去成，但在长达两周的共处中，姐妹俩渐渐摸索出了非常时期的非常策略。
After two weeks of living together, though nowhere, the sisters gradually groped out an extraordinary strategy for the hard times.
父亲爱打牌，但一输血压就高。
Father likes to play cards, but his blood pressure goes up when he loses.
姐妹俩顶着母亲的训斥，买回扑克，承担起“常输牌友”的角色。
The sisters, facing their mother's rebuke, bought back poker and took on the role of "frequent loser."
一周过去，父亲的血压居然降下来了。
A week went by and my father's blood pressure came down.
至于相亲，“不能出门”的安全准则暂时解决了问题。
As for blind dates, the "no go out" safety guidelines have temporarily solved the problem.
母亲试图以“出了问题至少多个人依靠”来教育两姐妹，并将“非典时期北京离婚率下降”的旧闻大声朗读，但李欣很快找到“非典之后离婚率飙升”的报道予以回应。
Her mother tried to educate the two sisters by saying "at least more people depend on what's wrong" and read aloud the old story of a "falling divorce rate in SARS Beijing," but Li quickly found a "post-SARS surge."
“特殊时期特殊状况下的形成的特殊关系，基本没有规律可循。
"The special relationship formed under special circumstances in special periods has no laws to follow.
现在也一样。
It's the same now.
”李欣说。
'she said.
但她还是在相处中发现了母亲的智慧。
But she discovered the wisdom of her mother in her relationship.
公司群里，老板发了一大堆暗示大家开工的话，听李欣读完这套高级又迂回的话术，母亲一边包饺子一边说：“只有你是真心为别人好，才能说出好听的话。
In the company, the boss made a lot of hints that everyone started work, listen to Li Xin read this advanced and circuitous way, mother said as she wrapped dumplings: "Only if you really for others good, can you say good words.
”“我做了这么多年文案，觉得我妈这句超过市面50%的金句。
"" After all these years of writing, I think my mother's golden parlance exceeds 50% of the market.
”李欣说。
'she said.
另一金句是，被问到家里最难是哪段时间，母亲在开启了一个多小时的完整回顾后，说：“咱家没有太难的时候，至少都没有武汉人民难。
When asked what was the toughest time at home, my mother, after more than an hour of thorough review, said, "We have never been too hard, at least not as hard as the Wuhan people.
”尾王鹏最终没有把《囧妈》推荐给母亲。
In the end, Wang Peng didn't recommend "Jung Ma" to his mother.
一是在他看来，困在车厢与困在家中一样，都是极端环境，因而即便为此作出什么改变，也不过是应激的、暂时的；二是漫长的假期最终告一段落，在一切变得更加难以控制之前，他坐上了回京的列车。
For one thing, being stuck in a car was as extreme as being trapped in his home, so that any change would be merely stressful and temporary. Second, the long vacation was over and he got on the train back to Beijing before it became even more difficult to control.
路上他刷了另一部关于亲子关系的电影，《阳光普照》。
On the way he brushed another film about parenthood, Sunshine.
平静的节奏下，父与子之间的矛盾与羁绊如暗流涌动。
Under the calm rhythm, the contradiction and the tie between father and son surges like the undercurrent.
与《囧妈》一样，两代人最终在某种程度上达成了和解，只是代价惨重。
Like "Damn," two generations ended up reconciling to some extent, albeit at a steep price.
这让他感到“躲避”可能并非完美解决方式。
This made him feel that "avoidance" might not be the perfect solution.
虽然尚未想到与母亲沟通的有效方法，但王鹏记住了电影中在驾校工作的父亲反复提及的八个字：把握时间，掌握方向。
Although he hasn't thought of an effective way to communicate with his mother, Peng Wang remembers the eight words his father used to mention in the movie: master the time, master the direction.
“这八个字，也许对很多事都有指导意义。
'These eight words, perhaps, will guide many things.
”王鹏说。
"said Wang Peng.
应被采访者要求，文中刘芸、王鹏、张晓、杨菲、李欣、李璐为化名。
