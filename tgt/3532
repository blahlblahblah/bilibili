Play澎湃新闻记者王嘉仪 实习生 林美汕 素材来源 @中国东方航空 央视新闻责任编辑：王嘉仪意大利外长迪马约在接受意大利国家电视台采访时，曾表示感谢中国政府支持意大利抗击疫情，并点赞了中国抗疫经验。
China Eastern Airlines CCTV News Responsibility Editor Wang Jiayi In an interview on Italian state television, Foreign Minister Wang Jiayi expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for its support in the fight against the epidemic and hailed China's experience in fighting the disease.
“近几天中国将向意大利派遣物资和一批专业的医疗专家队伍，他们是第一批面对新冠病毒的人，有着丰富经验，对此，我十分感谢中国政府。
"In recent days China will send supplies to Italy and a contingent of professional medical experts with extensive experience as the first people to face the new crown virus, for which I am very grateful to the Chinese government.
”此外，中国也向伊朗、伊拉克派出了专家小组。
In addition, China has sent teams of experts to Iran and Iraq.
中国做出的实际努力还包括：向世界卫生组织捐款2000万美元，向有关国家捐赠口罩、药品、防护服等防疫物资，向一些国家出口急需的医疗物资和设备。
China has also made practical efforts, including making a donation of 20 million US dollars to the World Health Organization, donating epidemic prevention materials such as masks, medicines and protective clothing to the countries concerned, and exporting much-needed medical supplies and equipment to some countries.
中国地方政府和民间机构也纷纷向其他国家伸出援手。
China's local governments and non-governmental organizations are also helping other countries.
有人担心，国内的疫情还没有消失，现在把专家派到国外，是不是太早了。
Some worry that the epidemic is not over at home, and it is not too early to send experts abroad.
需要说明的是，中国派出专家组，输出的不是人力而是经验，主要是将我们的“抗疫笔记”与对方共享。
It is important to note that China dispatched a team of experts, not manpower but experience, mainly to share our "anti-epidemic notes" with each other.
而且国内的在院治疗存量患者每天都在减少。
And the number of hospital-based patients in the country is decreasing every day.
当然，这些代表国家出征的专家将来在国内也应该获得相应的补贴、表彰，这大概没有悬念。
Of course, these experts on behalf of the country in the future should also receive the corresponding subsidies, recognition, this is probably not a suspense.
对于中国对外输出抗疫力量，我们应该保持理性、平和的心态。
For China to export anti-epidemic forces, we should maintain a rational and peaceful mentality.
这首先是我们对之前收到的善意做出的回报。
This is first and foremost a return on the goodwill we have received.
正如外交部副部长马朝旭所说，向中方提出援助请求的国家很多都曾经向中国提供过捐助。
As Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said, many of the countries that have requested assistance from China have made donations to China.
一来一回，友谊的桥梁会更加坚固。
Once a time, the bridge of friendship will be stronger.
中国人一向讲究投桃报李，也没必要对“桃”与“李”的分量锱铢必较，每个国家在对外援助时都会考量自身的能力与对方需求的迫切程度。
The Chinese are too granular about peaches and lees, and every country thinks about its own abilities and the urgency of its needs when it comes to foreign aid.
全球抗疫注定是一场艰辛的持久战。
The global fight against the disease is bound to be a long and arduous one.
新冠疫情发生在全球化背景下，各国经济互相依赖，人员往来日益紧密，病毒搭乘国际航班在“地球村”反复跨越。
The New Crown Epidemic occurred in the context of globalization, countries' economies are interdependent, people are increasingly close to each other, viruses in international flights in the "global village" over and over.
我们眼睁睁看着有些国家错失防疫窗口，它们可能正是低估了全球化的深度与广度。
We watched as some countries missed the immunization window, perhaps underestimating the depth and breadth of globalization.
而疫情对国际经贸的冲击，几乎没有国家可以幸免，甚至有人悲观地预测疫情会造成全球经济“脱钩”。
Few countries are immune to the impact of the epidemic on international trade and economic relations, and some even gloomily predict that the outbreak will cause global economic "decoupling."
因此各国合作抗疫也是挽手自救，只有所有国家都平安“渡劫”，大家才能继续享受全球化的好处。
Therefore, all countries to cooperate in the fight against the epidemic is self-help, only all countries safe "hijack", so that everyone can continue to enjoy the benefits of globalization.
“疫情一来，各自为战”的局面只会挫伤所有国家对全球化的信心。
The fragmented nature of the epidemic will only undermine the confidence of all countries in globalization.
中国作为一个大国，积极参与抗疫国际合作，也是表明对外开放的诚意与决心。
As a large country, China has actively participated in international cooperation against epidemic diseases and has demonstrated its sincerity and determination to open up to the outside world.
作为大国国民，也要有开放的胸襟和长远的目光。
As nationals of a big country, we should also have an open mind and a long-term vision.
不必陷入无谓的争执，我们做好自己的事，履行好相应的职责，自能收获我们应得的评价。
Instead of getting bogged down in unnecessary arguments, we do our part, fulfill our responsibilities, and reap what we deserve.
其实大多数国人对疫情严重国家是感同身受的，某些过当的话、不合适的比喻只是个别现象，更多是为他们着急心切。
In fact, most Chinese people have the same feelings about the serious epidemic of the country, some inappropriate words, inappropriate metaphors are only isolated phenomena, more anxious for them.
病毒眼中没有国界，只有跨越国界的合作与努力，才能战胜疫情。
The virus sees no borders, and only cooperation and efforts across borders can overcome the epidemic.
