第一季度GDP恐现0.3%的衰退3月8日，欧盟对意大利的财政请求做出回应，允许意大利扩大财政预算，用于防疫紧急支出的63亿欧元将不列入赤字计算中。

对于意大利第一季度的经济增长，以博科尼大学经济学家达维里（Daveri）为代表的观点认为，意大利的经济很可能在第一季度出现0.3%的衰退。
For Italy's economic growth in the first quarter, Italy's economy is likely to shrink by 0.3% in the first quarter, according to Boconi University economist Daeri.
需要注意的是，意大利2019年的国内生产总值（GDP）增速仅为0.2%以旅游业、交通运输为代表的服务业是意大利重要的创收来源，也是受疫情影响最大的行业之一。
It should be noted that Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by only 0.2% in 2019. Services, represented by tourism and transport, are an important source of revenue for Italy and one of the sectors most affected by the epidemic.

According to official Italian data, in 2019 Italian tourism revenues amounted to approximately Euro45 billion, contributing about 10 per cent of Italy's GDP, which is higher than the global average (1.8 per cent).
但是，从旅游的季节性分布来看，当前处于意大利旅游业的淡季，整体冲击尚不明显。

At the same time, some analyses point out the negative effects of Italy's economic fluctuations on the entire EU economy, which impedes the free movement of people and goods within the EU, or may lead to a decline in intra-EU trade.
意大利疫情危急，教皇要开直播了上月26日，教皇方济各被看到出现咳嗽、擤鼻子等状况。
Pope Francis was seen coughing and blowing his nose during a live broadcast of the Italian outbreak on Saturday.

At an event earlier that day, Francis shook hands with the faithful in the front row, kissed a baby as the Pope drove past St. Peter's Square, and greeted visiting bishops at the end.
次日（2月27日），原定当日上午前往拉兰特圣约翰大教堂，与罗马神职人员出席四旬斋仪式，不过梵蒂冈方面表示，教皇“有些不舒服，更愿意待在圣玛尔大之家，（他的）其他活动照常进行。
