武汉第一批七家定点医院医用物资也存在短缺防疫物资今日抵达汉口，明日有望缓解本文首发于南方人物周刊文|本刊记者徐梅 赵蕾 张宇欣编辑|周建平 蒯乐昊全文约3479字，细读大约需要9分钟有的市属一级医院由于没有防护服，没有N95口罩，医生只能自己想办法，穿两层蓝色隔离服，戴两层医用口罩，用塑料袋做鞋套据《湖北日报》消息：1月26日上午，经中央军委批准，联勤保障部队首批防疫物资运抵汉口火车站。
Wuhan's first batch of seven designated hospitals are also short of medical supplies. Tomorrow, it is hoped that this article will alleviate the problem. With no protective clothing and no N95 face mask, the first batch of supplies will arrive at Hankou Railway Station on the morning of January 26 with the approval of the CMC.
国家卫生健康委副主任王贺胜、湖北省卫生健康委主要负责人与军方现场交接。
Wang He-sheng, vice-director of the National Health Commission, Hubei Provincial Health Committee, and the military handover.
这批物资包括防护服10000套，医用酒精3750瓶，鞋套10000套等。
The shipment consisted of 10,000 suits of protective clothing, 3,750 bottles of medical alcohol and 10,000 sets of shoe covers.
现场交接完毕后，防疫物资将以最快的速度送往武汉各大医院。
After the on-site handover, epidemic prevention materials will be sent to Wuhan major hospitals as soon as possible.
大医院也达不到全套防护“武汉现在太需要强心剂了！”一位本地记者告诉南方人物周刊，截至1月26日上午，武汉各家医院都有不同程度的物资短缺，“有的市属一级医院由于没有防护服，没有N95口罩，医生只能自己想办法，穿两层蓝色隔离服，戴两层医用口罩，用塑料袋做鞋套。
Wuhan needs intensive care all the time.As of January 26, Wuhan hospitals were suffering from material shortages to varying degrees, a local reporter told People's Weekend magazine. Some municipal level-I hospitals had no protective clothing, no N95 masks, and doctors had to do their own thing, wearing two blue suits, two medical masks and plastic bags for shoes
”相对于其他城市，武汉的医疗资源还是比较丰富的，一般武汉市民口中的“四大家”指的是同济医院、协和医院、省人民医院和中南医院，这些医院又分别有一些分院区，例如刚刚被征用的同济中法新城医院和协和西院。
Wuhan is rich in medical resources compared with other cities, and the average Wuhan people's population refers to Tongji Hospital, Concorde Hospital, Provincial People's Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital, which in turn have some sub-compounds, such as the newly requisitioned Tongzhong-France Xincheng Hospital and the Western Concorde Hospital.
“四大家”之下，是几家省级医院——湖北省中医院、省新华医院、湖北省三医院（原中山医院）、中部战区医院武昌院区（原陆军总医院）和汉口院区（原解放军一六一医院）。
Under "Four people," there are several provincial hospitals - Hubei Province Chinese Hospital, Provincial Xinhua Hospital, Hubei Province Three Hospitals (formerly Zhongshan Hospital), Central War Area Hospital Wuchang Hospital (formerly the Army General Hospital) and Hankou Hospital (formerly the 161 Hospital of the Liberation Army).
再往下排是武汉市一级的医院，包括武汉市一医院，二医院，三医院，四医院，五医院，六医院，七医院，八医院，九医院，武昌医院，汉口医院……大大小小有几十所。
The next row is Wuhan city-level hospitals, including Wuhan City one hospital, two hospitals, three hospitals, four hospitals, five hospitals, six hospitals, seven hospitals, eight hospitals, nine hospitals, Wuchang Hospital, Hankou Hospital.
随着新冠肺炎疫情升级，武汉市在早期两家定点医院和61家发热门诊的基础上，分批共征用24家综合医院，临时改造成为发热病人收治医院，使收治床位规模逐步达到约一万张。
With the escalation of the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic, the city of Wuhan requisitioned 24 general hospitals in batches on the basis of the two earlier designated hospitals and 61 fever clinics, temporarily transforming them into treatment hospitals for febrile patients, bringing the total number of beds to about 10,000.
第一批整体征用的是武汉市汉口医院、武汉市红十字会医院、武汉市普爱医院西院、武汉市七医院、武汉市九医院、武汉市武昌医院和武汉市五医院七家医院。
The first overall requisition was made by Wuhan Hankou Hospital, Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, Wuhan Western Hospital of Puai Hospital, Wuhan Seven Hospital, Wuhan Nine Hospital, Wuhan Wuchang Hospital and Wuhan Five Hospital.
“第一批七家医院医用物资也存在短缺。
"There is also a shortage of medical supplies for the first seven hospitals.
最缺的就是口罩，防护服，护目镜，一次性橡胶检查手套。
The most missing are masks, protective clothing, goggles, disposable rubber gloves.
”一位与多家医院有业务往来的材料供应商印证了那位记者的话。
A supplier of materials dealing with hospitals corroborated the reporter's story.
包括省人民医院等多家大医院也通过互联网向社会募集物资。
Many major hospitals, including the provincial People's Hospital, also collect materials from the society via the Internet.
26日早晨，一家三甲医院光谷分院传递到本院的消息令人心酸，一位本院医生一早接到去支援的同事打来电话，告知前方防护服不够，“穿上就八个小时不能吃、不能喝，根本没办法做到每四个小时更换一次。
On the morning of May 26, a doctor from the Guangya Branch of a 3A hospital called to tell him that the front protective clothing was inadequate. "I couldn't eat or drink it for eight hours and couldn't change it every four hours.
没有护目镜，没有专用防感染口罩，第一天就有放射科医生感染，症状已经高度疑似。
There are no goggles, no special anti-infection mask, the first day of infection by a radiologist, symptoms have been highly suspected.
”长期报道本地医卫的跑口记者告诉南方人物周刊，“大医院最一线的隔离病房，病毒浓度最高，防护还是有保障。
"The most front-line isolation ward in a major hospital has the highest concentration of the virus and protection is still guaranteed," a longtime local health journalist told Southern People's Weekly.
但是现在要求各科室都上全套防护，这个的确是连大医院都达不到的。
But now all departments are required to have the full range of protection that even a major hospital can't afford.
”据了解，协和医院的非一线医护人员也没有配发专业防护服，一位年轻的医生告诉一直通过微信关心自己的亲戚，她平常只能穿一次性手术衣，只有在可能接触高危病人时，才会穿上自己此前网购的防护服。
A young doctor told relatives who had been taking care of themselves through a microphone that she would normally wear a disposable surgical uniform and only wear the protective clothing she had previously purchased online if she was likely to come into contact with high-risk patients.
武汉围城后，各家医院都陆续收到了一些社会捐赠，但是社会捐赠的物资很多达不到医用标准。
Wuhan after the siege of hospitals have received a number of social donations, but many of the social donations do not meet the medical standards.
这些不够标准的防护服、口罩、护目镜也都派上了用场，门诊导医台、服务台，以及一些负责疏导的外围工作人员得到了适度的保护。
Substandard protective clothing, face masks and goggles were also used, and the outpatient clinic, the help desk and peripheral staff responsible for the evacuation were given appropriate protection.
疫情爆发太快，这几天物资实在紧张，也有些医院整理了社会捐赠物资中相对可用的，发给一线医护应急。
Outbreak too fast, these days supplies are really tight, but also some hospitals collated the relatively available social donations, issued first-line medical emergency.
1月24日，联勤保障部队收到武汉市政府有关请求后，第一时间向中央军委报告，并启动应急机制，做好防疫物资的开箱、检验等工作。
On January 24, after receiving the relevant request from the Wuhan Municipal Government, the PLA immediately reported the request to the CMC, activated the emergency mechanism and made sure that the materials for epidemic prevention were unpacked and inspected.
待中央军委批复后，联勤保障部队又及时优化运输路线，采用军民融合的方式，快速将物资运抵武汉。
Upon the approval of the CMC, the PLA has also optimized the transportation routes in time, adopting the method of civil-military integration to deliver the goods to Wuhan quickly.
“我们相信物资短缺只是暂时的，但是的确盼望调度分发的环节可以更优化一些。
"We believe the shortage is only temporary, but we do look forward to a more optimal dispatch chain."
”一位医生通过上海的朋友弄到了几千只口罩，那位朋友想办法及时送到了武汉。
A doctor got thousands of masks through his friends in Shanghai, who managed to get them to Wuhan in time.
他盼望今天抵达汉口的物资，可以尽快发放到一线。
He hopes the supplies that arrived in Hankou today will be delivered to the front line as soon as possible.
1月24日，武汉大学中南医院重症医学科的医护人员在办公室吃年夜饭。
On Jan. 24, medical staff from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University had their New Year's Eve meal in the office.
当日是中国传统的除夕，武汉大学中南医院重症医学科的医护人员坚守岗位。
Chinese traditional New Year's Eve, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in the field of intensive care staff to stay on duty.
在病房外的办公室里，他们简单地吃了一顿工作餐，当作年夜饭，随即换装上岗，继续奋战在抗击新型肺炎疫情一线。
In the office outside the ward, they simply ate a working meal as a Chinese New Year's Eve meal, then changed on duty, and continued to fight the battle against the new pneumonia epidemic.
据悉，武汉地区医疗机构约8万名医务人员，春节期间都坚守岗位 图 / 新华社小医院面临更大压力大医院尚且如此，小医院的压力更大了。
Some 80,000 medical workers in Wuhan are on duty during the Spring Festival, according to the report. / Xinhua News Agency Small Hospital is under more pressure.
规模比较小的医院，平常病人不多，急诊病人更少，突然之间推上风口浪尖，医护人员都在艰难应对。
Smaller hospitals, usually with fewer patients and fewer emergency patients, were suddenly pushed to the top of the air, and health care workers struggled to cope.
张离（化名）医生26日上午10点跟南方人物周刊记者通话时，告诉我们临床医护人员所需的护目镜依然有缺口，防护服暂时够用，但她不知道够撑几天。
Zhang Deyi (alias) told reporters at 10: 00 a.m. on the South Week, told us that the need for clinical health care goggles still gap, protective clothing temporarily enough, but she did not know enough to last a few days.
她所在的医院成为第一批定点医院前，除呼吸科外，其他科室都没有防护用具。
Before her hospital became the first designated hospital, none of the other departments except the respiration department had protective gear.
呼吸科早已“爆满”，走廊放满了加床。
The respiratory department was "full" and the hallway was full of extra beds.
医院腾了一层楼专门收治呼吸科病人。
The hospital has a floor dedicated to respiratory patients.
张离和同事每天都穿着普通的医护服、戴着普通医用口罩到病房，每天三班倒（白班早上8点到下午5点半；中班下午5点半到凌晨1点半；夜班凌晨1点半到早上8点）。
Zhang and his colleagues wear ordinary medical clothes and masks to the ward three times a day (8: 30 a.m. to 5: 30 p.m. in the daytime; 5: 30 p.m. to 1: 30 a.m. in the middle class; and 1: 30 a.m. to 8: 00 a.m. in the evening).
1月中旬，张离和同事们收到了医院通知，要求做好对新型肺炎的防护工作。
In mid-January, Zhang and his colleagues received a notification from the hospital asking for better protection against the new pneumonia.
而通过抽血和CT检查，她所在的科室负责的病房已有三例疑似病人。
And through the blood and CT examination, her section is responsible for the ward has three suspected patients.
张离和同事们早在十余天前向医院申请防护用具，但医院没有多余物资可发。
Zhang and his colleagues applied to the hospital more than 10 days ago for protective gear, but the hospital had no spare supplies to send.
23日，全院职工都做了抽血和肺部CT检查，检验结果有疑者都需在家隔离，结果他们科就查出共五名医护人员结果有异。
23, the staff of the hospital have had blood and lung CT examination, the results of the test are suspected have to be isolated at home, their department found a total of five health-care staff results different.
25岁的王晓（化名）是中南医院某科室的护士，她是被借调到武汉市第七人民医院的。
Wang Xiao (alias), 25, is a nurse in a department of Zhongnan Hospital. She was seconded to Wuhan Seventh People's Hospital.
1月22日，武汉市同济医院、协和医院和中南医院在武汉市第七人民医院联合设立了发热门诊。
On January 22, Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Concorde Hospital and Zhongnan Hospital jointly set up a fever clinic at Wuhan Seventh People's Hospital.
此前，她和其他五名同事在本院接受了感染科护士长的培训。
Earlier, she and five other colleagues received training at the hospital from the head nurse of the infection department.
1月23日早上8点，王晓开始在七医院发热门诊化验科负责抽血，第七人民医院比较简陋，没有医护人员专用通道，穿防护服的医生在人满为患的医院里挤进挤出，通常护目镜上都是雾气，只能通过在防护服上写名字相互辨认。
At 8 a.m. on January 23, Wang Xiao began to take blood from the fever clinic laboratory of the Seven Hospital. The Seventh People's Hospital was relatively rudimentary, there were no special passages for medical staff, and doctors in protective clothing squeezed in and out of overcrowded hospitals. Usually the goggles were foggy and could only be identified by writing names on protective clothing.
医院防护服始终紧缺，一线医护人员的防护服不能保证四小时更换一轮，而是从上班穿戴到下班才脱。
Hospital protective clothing is always in short supply, the front-line medical personnel's protective clothing can not guarantee a four-hour change round, but from work wear to off-duty.
普通接诊的医护人员每人一天只发两个医用外科口罩。
Only two medical surgical masks are issued per person per day for general medical consultations.
在重症隔离区，王晓看到医生全天戴一个N95口罩，口罩通常半个小时就湿透了，“他们也没时间摘了换”。
In the intensive care unit, Wang Xiao saw doctors wearing a N95 mask all day, which was usually soaked in half an hour. "They don't have time to replace it."
1月24日，在武汉大学中南医院重症隔离病房，医护人员在隔离服上写下名字，方便辨认 图 / 新华社医护人员的心理疏导需引起重视病人陡增，产生的医疗污染物量也很大，“人手不够，也没有办法及时处理。
On January 24, in the intensive care unit of Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, doctors and nurses wrote down their names on quarantine suits so as to facilitate the identification of medical staff.
”一位医生告诉我们。
"a doctor told us.
医护人群每天面对着繁重复杂的防疫工作，满负荷运转，心理压力也在所难免。
Medical and health-care people face a heavy and complex epidemic prevention work every day, running at full load, psychological pressure is inevitable.
张平（化名）曾经跟几个护士姐妹互相安慰，张平说，医护面临的困难显而易见，是大家都知道的，“再多说没有意义。
Zhang Ping (not his real name) once comforted several nurses and sisters. Zhang Ping said the difficulties facing medical care were obvious and well known.
”张平所在的那家医院，很早就有医生在群里讨论新型肺炎的病例不太寻常，呼吸科感染科医生最开始是有警惕的，他们在群里给同事们做了一些科普。
Zhang's hospital, where doctors had long been discussing unusual cases of new pneumonia, was wary at first and gave colleagues some popular science in the group.
抗击新型肺炎的上岗医护人员实行轮班制，一旦上岗就是15天，每四个小时一班，因为防护装备不够，再加上一旦上岗病人也确实很多，医生常常忙到不能吃、不能喝、不能上厕所。
Induction workers fighting the new pneumonia operate on a shift basis for 15 days, every four hours, once on duty, because of inadequate protective equipment and the fact that there are indeed many patients on duty, doctors are often too busy to eat, drink or use the toilet.
15天值班结束后，还要隔离观察15天。
The 15-day duty is followed by 15 days of isolated observation.
这样一来，一线医护每轮就至少一个月的时间不能与家人见面。
As a result, front-line care workers cannot see their families for at least a month at a time.
“有的医护自己已经流感，但是拍片肺部没有问题不能诊断是新型肺炎，就不让请假。
"Some people care about having the flu themselves, but there's nothing wrong with taking a lung and they can't diagnose the new pneumonia.
”第一批物资到汉之后，张平的朋友感慨接下来应更多关心一线医护的心理健康，“特殊时期，每个医院都是全员待命。
After the first supplies arrived in China, Zhang's friends lamented that more attention should be paid to the mental health of first-line care.
每天都要面对心急如焚的病患。
Every day I have to deal with distraught patients.
虽然是医务工作者，他们大多也是人生第一次亲历这种未可知的传染性疫情，他们也会害怕，也有担心，可是时间不等人，来不及等他们做好心理建设，医疗工作者就要一头扎进一线。
Although they are health workers, most of them are also the first time in their lives to experience this unknown infectious disease, they will be afraid and worried, but time will not wait for them to do a good psychological construction, the medical workers will head into the front line.
”随着外地医疗援助队的进驻，各医院都将得到不同程度的人力增补支援。
Hospitals will receive additional manpower support to varying degrees with the arrival of field medical assistance teams.
有关方面正在积极落实将外援医疗人员、物资下沉到力量薄弱的医院。
Relevant parties are actively implementing the foreign aid medical personnel, supplies to sink to the weak hospitals.
