疫情爆发后，“家”这个字的含义突然变得宽广起来。
After the outbreak of the epidemic, the word "home" suddenly took on a broader meaning.
对于被禁锢于门内的居民来说，它是社区里的守望相助；对不幸感染的新冠患者来说，它是方舱医院里的“从陌生到熟悉”；而对于小D一家来说，它是每天不定时显示在微信群里的“你还好吗”。
For those confined to the door, it is a watch in the community; for the hapless newcomers, it is "from unfamiliar to familiar" in the cabin hospital; for the small D family, it is the "Are you all right" displayed in the micromail every day.
小D是武汉某医院的药剂师，妈妈是另一家医院的检验科医生，他还有两个表姐，一个是感染病房的护士，另一个是一线警察。
Xiao D is a pharmacist at a hospital in Wuhan, and his mother is a laboratory doctor at another hospital. He also has two cousins, one is an infection ward nurse and the other is a frontline policeman.
疫情期间，家族里六个人有一个小群，大家每天都会在群里报备体温，互相道一句平安，而小D一家三口被分隔在三处不同的“家”里，依靠电话，确认对方的情况。
During the outbreak, there was a small group of six people in the family, who reported for each other's temperature every day, and three members of the D family were separated in three different "homes" and relied on the telephone to confirm each other's condition.
奋战在各自岗位的家人们，正在等待疫情后的重聚。
Families fighting in their posts are waiting for the reunion after the outbreak.
以下是他的口述：我是湖北武汉人，在一家新冠定点医院的药剂科工作，除了我，家里还有三个人在这次疫情一线，我妈妈是另一家医院的检验科医生，两个表姐一个在感染病房当护士，另一个是警察。
The following is his oral testimony: I am a native of Hubei Wuhan, working in pharmacy department of a new Guan Ding Hospital. In addition to me, there are three people in my family on the front line of the epidemic.
身在医护家庭，我们家里可能就对（疫情的）信息敏感一些吧，当时一说华南海鲜市场集体肺炎，整个市场还进行了消毒的时候，我们自己就开始做防护了，买了口罩、手套之类的一些很基础的防护品，口罩就是普通的医用口罩。
When it comes to the collective pneumonia in the South China seafood market, when the whole market was disinfected, we started to take precautions ourselves, buying basic protective masks, such as masks and gloves, and masks as normal medical masks.
以前上下班没有戴口罩的习惯，有时候想起来才会戴一下，一听到消息后，就开始每天戴口罩，上班戴，下班戴，下班之后回家戴。
In the past, it was not a habit to wear face masks at work. Sometimes I wore them when I thought of it. On hearing the news, I started wearing them every day.
新冠病毒正式被确诊后，我们医院里面就开始做一些集中培训，讲解新冠病毒的传播途径，教我们怎么防护，怎么避免院内感染。
After the new crown virus was diagnosed, we began to do some intensive training inside the hospital to explain the transmission of the new crown virus, teach us how to protect against, how to avoid nosocomial infection.
因为会有休息、值班或者住得很远的同事，所以培训延续了一个星期，每天下午都有，内容都是一样的，没听的就过去听。
Because there will be rest, duty or colleagues living far away, so the training lasted a week, every afternoon, content is the same, do not listen to the past.
好多科室也整合了，五官科、皮肤科这些科室都关了，全都改成感染科。
A number of departments have also integrated, five senses, dermatology these departments are closed, all changed to infection department.
现在我们要求是全院每个人都要戴口罩、戴手套、戴帽子，然后我们因为没有一线那么危险，防护服什么就没有，如果你自己能弄到护目镜、防护服，你就自己穿着、戴着。
Now we want everyone in the hospital to wear masks, gloves, hats, and then we don't have protective clothing because there's no line at all. If you can get goggles, protective clothing, you wear it yourself.
小D上班途中我们医院新冠病毒的病人还是非常多的，几层楼都是他们的病房。
Small D on the way to work our hospital is still a very large number of patients, several floors are their wards.
在药房我们能接触到的新冠病毒肺炎的病人，大多是轻症的，他们的药单上会标注是“确诊患者”或者“疑似患者”，但其实看药方就能分辨，现在就用那些药嘛。
Most of the patients we have access to at the pharmacy for Newcomovirus pneumonia are very mild. They have a list of "diagnosed" or "suspected" patients, but they can tell by looking at the prescription. Use them now.
封城那天，我印象特别深刻。
I was particularly impressed the day the city was closed.
我那天和别人换了班，要上24小时班，从第一天早上8点上到第二天早上8点。
I switched jobs that day and had to work 24 hours a day, from 8 a.m. on the first day to 8 a.m. the next morning.
然后第一天早上在地铁上看到10点封城的消息，整个人都傻了，也不是担心封城会怎么样，就是在想我第二天怎么回家。
Then on the first morning I saw the news of the 10 o'clock siege on the subway, and the whole person was dumbfounded, either worrying about what would happen to the city or wondering how I would get home the next day.
我们自己几个朋友有一个群，大家还在里面开玩笑，我就也开玩笑说了一句，“明天我怎么回去啊”。
Several of our friends have a group, everyone is still joking inside, I joked, "How can I go back tomorrow?"
后来当天晚上有个朋友给我打电话，他问我，“你明天是不是回不来”。
Later that evening a friend called me and asked me, "Are you not coming back tomorrow?"
我说“我要回估计也要等下午，我一个同事把我带回去。
I said, "I guess I'll wait for the afternoon, too, and one of my colleagues takes me back.
”我朋友他就觉得这种时候待在医院不太安全，就跟我说第二天早上他来接我。
"My friend thought it was not safe to stay in the hospital at such times, so he told me he would pick me up the next morning.
当时因为其实不知道我自己身上有没有什么（病毒），我就说不用他过来，但是他就坚持一定过来接我，说做好防护。
At the time, I didn't know if I had anything on me, so I said I didn't need him to come over, but he insisted on coming and picking me up.
当天晚上，我上班上着上着就哭了，真的都没想到，因为白天就是一句玩笑话，怎么说呢，就他不嫌弃我吧，我还是挺感动的。
That night, I went to work on the crying, really did not think, because the day is a joke, how to say, he did not dislike me, I still moved.
疫情之后我害怕身上有病毒，也怕互相传染，这段时间一直一个人在住。
After the outbreak, I was afraid of the virus on my body, and I was afraid that I would infect each other.
妈妈也是，她在另一家医院的检验科，因为距离原因，也怕把病毒带回家感染爸爸，感染我，就也没回去住，暂时住在外公外婆家，等于说是我们一家三口这段时间都不回同一个家。
Her mother in another hospital, because of distance, also afraid to take the virus home infected father, infected me, also did not go back to live, temporarily live in my grandfather's grandmother's house, it is said that the three of us did not return to the same home.
妈妈其实不太常和我聊她的工作内容，只知道她很累。
Mom doesn't really talk to me much about her job, except that she's tired.
家里人有个群，平时她会拍一下上班照，就是把自己包裹得很严实的照片，有时候口罩都戴破了。
The family has a group, she would usually take a picture of the work, is to wrap themselves up very tightly, sometimes wearing a broken mask.
她会给我们科普一些关于核酸的知识，（核酸检测）有些什么问题，准不准，存在什么假阴性、假阳性，你身体有其它问题，会导致结果没那么准确这些。
She will give us some information about nucleic acid, what's wrong with it, no doubt, what false-negative, false-positive, your body has other problems that can lead to less accurate results.
因为在不同的医院，也不回同一个家，疫情之后和妈妈几乎没有碰面，唯一一次见面是上上星期我喉咙有点不舒服，但那天我又没有开到药，妈妈就在她医院开了药，然后晚上给我送过来。
Because I didn't go back to the same home in different hospitals, I hardly met my mother after the outbreak. The only time I met was when I had a sore throat last week, but my mother prescribed medicine at her hospital the other day and brought it back to me in the evening.
见面的时候她包得像个粽子，我也包得像个粽子，两个人口罩、手套、帽子、眼镜都戴得整整齐齐，连脸都看不到。
She wrapped up like a dumplings, I also like a dumplings, two people wearing masks, gloves, hats, glasses are all in perfect shape, even the face can not see.
妈妈开了药还给我买了点吃的，把东西给我然后就走了。
Mom prescribed medicine and bought me something to eat, gave me something to eat and then left.
这段时间我和她基本都是靠线上联络，每天都会互相报个平安，就是我问她“你今天感觉怎么样？”，她说“还好”，然后我再报一下体温，她可能就说，“哎呀，我忘记了，我现在去量一下”这样的对话。
She and I are basically on the line, each day will report peace, is I asked her "how do you feel today?" she said, "OK," and then I took a temperature, she might say, "Gee, I forgot, I'm going to go check it out."
表姐在感染病房的工作照另外我表姐，姨妈的女儿，在感染病房做护士，她们医院最开始就是定点医院，然后她又在呼吸科，所以疫情最开始她就在（感染病房）里面了，大年三十都在病房里度过的。
My cousin's job in the infection ward Like my cousin, auntie's daughter, As a nurse in the infection ward, Their hospital started as a designated hospital, And then she was in the respiratory department, So she was in the ward from the start, And she spent the year in the ward.
她每天裹得更严实，手套都得戴两三层，因为她要直接接触新冠病人。
She was wrapped more tightly every day, and had to wear two or three layers of gloves, for she had to come into direct contact with the new crown patients.
因为防护做得太严实了，她呼吸都很困难，现在也回不了家，在附近的酒店统一隔离，每天吃东西也就随便吃一点，休息比较少，也睡不好。
She could not return to her home because the protection was so tight that she could not go home. She was isolated in a nearby hotel and ate a little food every day, with less rest and less sleep.
表姐结婚了，孩子在上小学，现在孩子也看不见面，都是姐夫一个人在照顾，最多就是在群里面视个频。
Cousin married, children in primary school, and now the children do not see each other, are a brother-in-law in the care, at most is in the group as a frequency.
有时候她上夜班，还视不了频，因为穿着防护服根本就用不了手机，就只能下班的时候抽空联络。
Sometimes she was on night shifts and couldn't see too much because she couldn't use her cell phone in protective clothing, so she had to take time off work to get in touch.
大家在家族群里面互相打气加油我们都在一个群里，聊天的过程中感觉她心态还好，表现出来比较乐观，最大的感受也还是累，从声音里面就能感觉到她的疲惫。
We were all in the same group, chatting with each other, feeling that she was in a good mood, that she was optimistic, that her biggest feelings were still tired, and that she was tired from her voice.
舅舅的女儿，我的另一个表姐，也在一线当警察，但是她的工作我没仔细问过，因为她家出了些事情，就不是很方便问她太多。
My uncle's daughter, another of my cousins, was also a front-line policeman, but I didn't ask her about her job, because it was not so convenient to ask her too much about what had happened to her family.
我们家年饭吃的比较早，过年期间就没有再聚在一起了。
We eat Chinese New Year dinner earlier, the New Year did not get together again.
以往每年初十外公过生日大家都要一起吃饭，今年生日也没一起，大家就视频，吃个饭碰个杯，就这样。
In the past every year, everyone will eat together on his birthday, this year's birthday did not together, everyone on the video, eat a cup of rice, that is.
因为我们家几个人相当于都在疫情线上，其他家人肯定会担心，但对我们这种状况也习惯了，每天大家聊天都还蛮正常的。
Because several people in our family are on the epidemic line, the rest of the family will be worried, but we are used to this situation, everyone talking every day is quite normal.
对于在一线的妈妈、两个表姐，最想说的就是一定保护好自己。
For the mother in the first line, two cousins, the most wanted to say is to ensure the protection of their own.
饭可以以后再吃，最重要的是一家人平平安安。
Dinner can be eaten later. The most important thing is that the family is safe.
其实我学医要从好早说起，因为小时候总是看妈妈穿着白大褂感觉很向往，后来选专业也不知道选什么就选了医科，说起来也算是机缘巧合。
In fact, I began to study medicine early, because when I was a child, I always looked forward to seeing my mother wearing a white coat.
疫情刚开始其实很害怕，因为毕竟20多年第一次碰到这么大的事情，虽然当时还没有确认这个病有传染性。
The outbreak was initially feared because it was the first such event in more than 20 years, although it was not confirmed that the disease was contagious.
后来确认了之后反倒就不怕了，因为该上的班还得上，你做了这一行，就也别想那么多吧。
I'm not afraid of that because I have to work on the shift, and I don't think that much about it when you do.
当然我没有在一线，可能我的心理和他们（一线医务人员）的心理又不一样。
Of course I'm not in the first line, maybe my psychology and theirs (front-line medical staff) are different.
但是说白了，现在医院里面都不安全，一定要做好防护。
But to put it bluntly, hospitals are not safe now and must be well protected.
封城那天，我买了几千块钱的药，妈妈也买了几千块钱的药，回来之后就到处分发。
On the day of the siege, I bought thousands of dollars worth of medicine, and my mother bought thousands of dollars of medicine and returned with them everywhere.
因为我们都知道，这种时候如果你有什么不舒服，千万不要去医院，因为很容易交叉感染。
Because we all know that if you have any discomfort at this time, don't go to the hospital, because it's easy to cross-infect.
几个朋友给我送东西或者因为其他的一些事情碰面，我就会把东西分给他们。
A few friends give me something or I meet someone because of something else, and I give them something.
像口罩、消毒液这些东西，好早我就开始买了，然后这个分一点，那个分一点这样子。
Things like masks, disinfectants, I started buying them a long time ago, and then this bit, that one a bit like this.
疫情这段时间家里也有老人去世，但不清楚是不是因为新冠，也有同学他们一家全部都确诊了。
During this period of the epidemic there were also elderly family members died, but it is not clear whether it is due to the new crown, there are students their family have all been diagnosed.
身边人也有来寻求帮助，这种时候其实感觉很无力，想帮助别人，但也帮不上忙。
People around you also have come to seek help, this kind of time actually feel very weak, want to help others, but also can not help.
我的话其实一直都不怎么看网上的信息，我的信息来源一般都是大楚网、医学网这些官方、专业的媒体。
In fact, my words have not read the information on the Internet, my information sources are generally the Dachu network, medical network, these official, professional media.
因为网上的信息实在是太多了。
Because there's so much information on the Internet.
好多朋友会在群里发一下信息，我每天都在给他们辟谣。
A lot of friends will send a message in the group, I give them a rumor every day.
这个不对，这个不对，这个也不对，这个为什么不对，那个为什么不对，请你以后不要再发了。
This is wrong, this is not right, this is not right, this why is wrong, that why is wrong, please do not send again.
过几个小时他又发条新的出来，然后又要跟他说，这个应该也不对。
After a few hours he wound up a new one and told him that this was not right either.
我这一抬头还是能看见路上有很多人散步啊，遛狗啊，还是不好管。
I can still see a lot of people walking on the road, walk the dog ah, or difficult to regulate.
我觉得这是长期作战，湖北这边也是最严重的，还是存在安全隐患。
I think this is a long-term battle, Hubei side is also the most serious, or there are security risks.
年也过完了，还不知道下一步是怎样，不好判断。
I don't know what to do next. It's hard to judge.
这段时间，门卫大爷对我的态度都不同了。
In the meantime, the guard had a different attitude towards me.
原来晚上晚归，没带门禁卡，麻烦他开个门大爷还要说两句。
I came home late at night, did not bring the door card, please open the door for him to say something.
前段时间进小区测体温，可能看见我的防护装备和别人不一样，戴着帽子、眼镜、手套还有口罩，他就问我“你是刚下班吧？”，我说是的，然后他给我测了下体温，问我有没有（防疫）证，我正准备脱手套掏的，他就说“不用了，不用了，进去吧”。
Some time ago, when I was taking a temperature check in the neighborhood, I might have seen my protective gear different from others, wearing hats, glasses, gloves and a mask. He asked me, "Are you just off duty?" I said yes, and then he took my temperature and asked if I had a certificate.
疫情结束之后，我想先回家吃个饭吧。
After the outbreak is over, I'd like to go home and have a meal.
那天我回家拿东西，站在门口门都不敢进。
I went home to get something that day and dared not come in at the door.
我爸爸在家嘛，我走的时候我爸爸还哭了，他说我太过分了，连门都不进。
My father was at home. When I left, my father cried. He said I went too far and didn't even enter the door.
和爸爸聊天不多，每天就是我说“你早点休息，别出去玩。
I don't talk much with my father. Every day I say, "You take a rest early and don't go out to play.
”然后他说“好，我没出去玩”，反正也不知道他说的真话还是假话。
"Then he said," Well, I didn't go out to play, "but I didn't know whether he was telling the truth or not.
现在全家的状态就是每天在群里报个平安，然后在各自的岗位继续奋斗。
The state of the family now is to have peace in the group every day and continue to struggle in their posts.
因为现在能做的也真的只有保护好自己，因为这种时候你一个人病了，其他人绝对不可能置身事外。
Because what you can do now is really only to protect yourself, because you are sick alone at this time, other people absolutely can't stay out of the way.
保护好自己，也劝导身边的人保护好自己。
Protect yourself, and persuade people around you to protect themselves.
疫情结束后我还想吃烧烤，特别想吃烧烤。
I want to have a barbecue after the epidemic, especially a barbecue.
叫几个朋友一起吃个烧烤，喝点酒，特别好。
Get some friends to have a barbecue and a drink. It's great.
