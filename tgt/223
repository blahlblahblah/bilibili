新型病毒核酸检测试剂盒（以下简称“检测试剂盒“）作为本次新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊的重要手段，目前包括武汉在内，各地均有反映院内检测试剂盒缺货的情况发生，而尤以湖北省内居多。
As an important means to diagnose pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection, new viral nucleic acid test kit (hereinafter referred to as "detection kit") has been found in Wuhan and elsewhere, especially in Hubei Province.
。
.
这一现象被外界简单解读为“供不应求”，但事实上，这一现象应从生产、市场准入、采购、使用等多个环节来解析，一句“供不应求”不足以还原问题的复杂面貌。
In fact, this phenomenon should be analyzed from the aspects of production, market access, procurement and use. "Supply exceeds demand" is not enough to restore the complex face of the problem.
。
.
生产。
Production.
针对检测试剂盒的供应问题，界面新闻记者采访了作为国家卫健委确定的三家生产企业之一，上海捷诺生物某负责人。
In view of the supply of testing kits, the interface reporter interviewed one of the three production enterprises identified by the National Health Commission, a person in charge of Tenero biology in Shanghai.
这位负责人表示，目前在生产端供应是充足的。
The person in charge said the current supply on the production side is adequate.
。
.
据其透露，迄今为止，上海捷诺生物给武汉供应的检测试剂盒在5万人份左右。
So far, around 50,000 test kits have been supplied to Wuhan by Shanghai Teno organisms, according to the company.
生产能力上，昨日（1月23日）生产了3万人份，今天（1月24日）可生产12万人份。
In terms of production capacity, 30,000 people were produced yesterday (January 23) and 120,000 today (January 24).
尤为重要的是，该负责人表示，目前接到的所有疾控订单都及时交付了。
In particular, the responsible person said that all CDC orders currently received had been delivered in a timely manner.
。
.
而对于物流问题，目前上海捷诺生物基本都是专线专人专送，而另一家生产企业上海辉睿生物方面此前对界面新闻透露，公司通过三地仓库就近发货，物流手段包括空运、人肉带货等等。
At present, Shanghai Jeno biological issues are dedicated to the delivery, and another manufacturer Shanghai Pfizer has previously told the interface news, the company through three warehouses nearby, logistics means including air transport, meat delivery, and so on.
。
.
据此前了解，上海辉睿生物的产能则至少在生产2万人份，而国家卫健委确定的生产企业还有上海伯杰医疗，此外已有超过20家企业宣布研发成功了检测试剂盒，这些企业虽然并不是国家卫健委确定企业，但这些企业也可向地方疾控进行销售。
According to the previous understanding, Shanghai Pfizer is producing at least 20, 000 people, and the National Fitness and Wellness Commission has identified the production enterprises of Shanghai Berger Medical, in addition to more than 20 enterprises have announced the development of successful test kits, although these enterprises are not identified by the National Health Commission, but these enterprises can also sell to local disease control.
。
.
必须强调的是，虽然本次是新型病毒，且目前在临床上未有特效药物，但界面新闻此前曾报道，无论是检测人士还是生产企业均表示，在病毒基因全序列公布后，找到特异性片段，做出检测试剂盒并非一件高技术难度的事。
It is important to note that although this is a new virus and there is no specific drug available clinically, the Interface News has previously reported that it is not technically difficult to find specific fragments of the virus gene once its full sequence has been published.
。
.
而在生产上，排除春节放假因素，某业内知名企业基因检测市场总监对界面新闻记者表示，每家生产企业有自己的工艺，最主要在于做出标准品，并判断其检测能力，此外需要与试剂如预混液配比，构成完整的PCR反应体系。
But in production, excluding the Spring Festival holiday factors, a well-known industry genetic testing market director told the interface reporter, each manufacturer has its own process, the most important thing is to make standard products, and judge its detection capacity, in addition to reagents, such as pre-mixed liquid, to form a complete PCR reaction system.
目前超过二十家企业宣布研发成功，虽然目前并未有整体的产能统计，但产能是充足的。
More than 20 companies have so far announced successful R & D, and although there is no overall production capacity statistics, there is sufficient capacity.
。
.
市场准入与采购。
Market access and procurement.
从生产企业到疾控采购的这一过程，各方企业负责人都称没有出现供不应求的情况，为何又会出现湖北各地医院纷纷表示检测试剂盒缺货？。
From the production of enterprises to the process of disease control procurement, enterprise leaders on all sides said that there is no shortage of the situation, why there will be a variety of hospitals around Hubei said that the test kit is out of stock?
通过梳理整个流程我们发现，新型病毒检测试剂盒在院内缺货的首要原因在于，根据国家法规政策，各级医院目前无法直接采购新型病毒检测试剂盒。
Through combing the whole process, we found that the first reason that the new virus detection kit is out of stock in the hospital is that according to the national policy, hospitals at all levels can not directly purchase the new virus detection kit.
。
.
根据相关药品、医疗器械的相关法规，一般情况下，在中国境内获批上市的药品、医疗器械应首先在各省、市级招采平台挂网，随后由医院进行采购。
In accordance with the relevant laws and regulations on pharmaceuticals and medical devices, medicines and medical instruments approved for listing in China shall first be posted on provincial and municipal platforms and then purchased by hospitals.
对于首次进院药品、医疗器械产品而言，往往还需要院方召开药事会通过才可采购。
For the first time into the hospital drugs, medical equipment products, often requires the hospital to convene a pharmaceutical council before procurement.
但在目前的疫情下，药事会与挂网窗口这两方因素的影响可忽略不计。
But in the current epidemic, the impact of the two factors, the pharmaceutical council and the screen-hanging window, is negligible.
。
.
然而，尽管各家企业研发出了新型肺炎病毒检测试剂盒，但这些试剂盒并未获得国家药监局批准正式上市。
However, despite the development of new test kits for pneumonia virus detection, these kits have not been approved by the State Administration of Pharmacy.
。
.
检测试剂盒作为三类医疗器械，一般情况下首先需要经过开展临床试验、随后向国家药监局提出上市注册申请，由国家药监局进行审评批准后方可以正式上市，才获得挂网招采机会，并且进入院内销售。
As three kinds of medical devices, the test kit usually needs to go through clinical test first, then apply to the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration for listing, and then be appraised and approved by the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration before it can be officially marketed.
而这一流程往往需要好几年。
This process often takes several years.
。
.
上述市场总监表示，对于检测试剂盒的注册国家药监局有严格审评流程，临床阶段要有复杂的质量质控、研发，生产流程文件提供，需要抽检三批试剂。
The marketing director said there was a rigorous review process for the registered State Administration of Pharmacy that tested the kits, complicated quality control, research and development at the clinical stage, production process documentation and three batches of reagents to be sampled.
。
.
对于临床样本数量不同的疾病，也有不一样的要求，有的入组人数需求多达几百、上千人。
For the number of different clinical samples of diseases, there are different requirements, some groups as many as hundreds of people, thousands of people.
而仅仅是向国家药监局审评提交文件注册这一环，常规来看要一年时间完成。
Instead, it usually takes a year to complete the registration of documents submitted to the SDA for review.
。
.
因此，目前所研发出的新型肺炎病毒检测试剂盒，实际上作为未获批上市产品身份略显尴尬，都无法由医院端直接采购进行使用，而只能向疾控部门进行申请使用，这也直接影响了对疑似病患的检测工作。
Therefore, the new Pneumonia virus detection kit developed at present, as an unapproved market product identity slightly embarrassed, can not be used directly by hospitals, but can only be applied to the CDC, which also has a direct impact on the detection of suspected patients.
。
.
疾控中心。
CDC CDC.
界面新闻获悉，在疫情刚开始之时，研制新型冠状病毒诊断试剂的机构有四家，分别是中国疾控中心、中国医学科学院、中科院武汉病毒所和军事医学科学院。
At the beginning of the outbreak, four organizations were involved in the development of new coronavirus diagnostic reagents, namely the China CDC, the Chinese Academy of Medicine, the Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Military Medicine.
。
.
最终，四家科研机构经过多轮比拼，代表中国疾控中心的三家生物科技企业研制出来的诊断试剂最终胜出，并以与疾控科研合作的渠道，向疾控系统提供检测试剂盒。
Eventually, after several rounds of competition, the diagnostic reagents developed by three biotech firms representing the China CDC won out and supplied the disease control system with test kits through collaboration with CDC.
。
.
界面新闻记者从多个信源独家获悉，目前国家药监局等相关部门正在开会研究，是否要针对检测试剂盒开通特殊上市渠道，以帮助医院提高检测诊断能力。
Interface reporters from a number of sources exclusive information, such as the State Drug Administration and other relevant departments are meeting to study whether to open a special test kit marketing channels to help hospitals improve the detection and diagnosis capacity.
。
.
到目前为止，药监局仍在做产品筛选，尚未有结论性文件出台，有知情人士透露：“预计很快了”，并称“特殊渠道开通后，预计院内供应不成问题”。
So far, the Drug Enforcement Administration is still screening products, no conclusive documents have been issued, "expected soon," said a person familiar with the matter, adding that "after the opening of special channels, the hospital supply is expected to be no problem."
。
.
不过，新冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情在本周进入了一个严峻的阶段，从医生到病人，都有点“等不起”了。
But this week, the pneumonia epidemic from the new coronavirus has entered a serious phase, with doctors and patients alike feeling a little overwhelmed.
。
.
业内人士指出，从逻辑上看，开放特殊上市渠道是会有助于解决院内缺乏试剂盒现象的，目前的疫情形势也需要一些政策推动来解决问题。
The industry pointed out that the opening of special listing channels would logically help address the shortage of kits in the hospital and that the current situation also required some policy impetus to address the problem.
。
.
在大型公共卫生事件发生时对一些新研制医药产品开辟特殊通道并非没有先例，2003年“非典”时期便曾执行过类似措施。
It is not unprecedented to open up special passages to newly developed pharmaceutical products in the event of a major public health event, similar measures having been implemented during the SARS period in 2003.
。
.
但值得注意的是，生产试剂盒的企业方对界面新闻表示，尽管控制疫情发展迫在眉睫，也希望政策制定和产品筛选一定要谨慎，以免酿成不良后果。
It is worth noting, however, that the manufacturers of test kits have said to the Interface News that, while there is an urgent need to control the outbreak, it is also hoped that policy-making and product screening will be cautious so as not to lead to adverse consequences.
。
.
那是否意味着，目前各地疾控在采购量上出了偏差，从而导致可以调配给医院的检测试剂盒出现紧缺？现有信息尚难以判断，但有业内人士透露，有些地方疾控出现了采购资金不足的情况。
Does that mean that there is currently a shortage of test kits that can be deployed to hospitals because of discrepancies in the volume of procurement for local disease control? The available information is difficult to judge, but industry sources have revealed that in some places CDC is underfunded.
。
.
1月23日，按照国务院部署，财政部紧急下拨湖北省新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控补助资金10亿元，支持湖北省开展疫情防控相关工作。
On January 23, in accordance with the State Council's plan, the Ministry of Finance made an emergency allocation of one billion yuan for the prevention and control of pneumonia related to the new coronavirus infection in Hubei Province.
。
.
检测条件。
Test conditions.
另一不容忽视的因素是检测条件。
Another factor that cannot be ignored is the condition of testing.
。
.
武汉市卫健委1月23日曾表示，前期（1月16日后）对疑似病例样本检测流程是：首诊医院通过规范的预检分诊，结合临床检查、实验室检查和胸部影像检查；经专家组会诊后确认疑似病例并采样，由辖区疾控中心将样本转运到市疾控中；市疾控中心转运到省疾控中心，进行核酸检测。
Wuhan city health committee said on January 23, the preliminary (January 16) sample testing process for suspected cases is: the first hospital through a standardized pre-screening, combined with clinical, laboratory and thoracic imaging; after the expert group consultation confirmed the suspected cases and samples, the jurisdiction CDC transferred samples to the city CDC for nucleic acid testing.
每天省疾控中心可检测样本200多份，从采样开始到结果返回，当前约需要2天左右的时间。
The CDC can detect more than 200 samples per day, from the beginning of sampling to the return of the results, which currently takes about two days.
。
.
前述业内人士分析，这种看上去相当繁琐的办法，是卫健委考虑到现有的检测试剂盒都没有通过正式审评上市，为了谨慎起见，都由省疾控来检测。
According to the industry insider analysis, this rather cumbersome approach is that the existing test kit has not passed the formal evaluation of the listing, as a precaution, by the provincial disease control test.
。
.
事实上，并非有了检测试剂盒，医院就可以开展病毒检测。
In fact, without a test kit, hospitals can test for the virus.
。
.
本次3家试剂盒均为RTPCR法，需使用PCR仪器在PCR实验室中进行检测Z有业内人士分析，PCR仪器生产厂家多如牛毛，应该不会存在缺少仪器的问题，但是否所有医院都拥有规范的PCR实验室，这要打一个问号。
All three kits are RTPCR, PCR instruments need to be tested in the PCR laboratory Z analysis, PCR instrument manufacturers should not be a shortage of equipment, but whether all hospitals have a standardized PCR laboratory, which is a question mark.
。
.
武汉卫健委1月23日的通报也指出，由于国家已将新型冠状病毒的肺炎纳入乙类传染病，采取甲类管理，对该类病原的样本检测，按照高致病性病原微生物（第二类）进行管理，相关样本的检测、运输等，必须符合生物安全管理的相关要求，病原相关实验活动应当在具备相应防护级别的生物安全实验室开展。
Wuhan Health Committee of the January 23 briefing also pointed out that since the state has the new coronavirus pneumonia into the B-infectious disease, a class A management, the detection of samples of the pathogen (type II), the detection and transportation of relevant samples must meet the requirements of biosafety management, pathogen-related experimental activities should be carried out in biosafety laboratories with appropriate protection level.
。
.
此外，也有一些更复杂的情况，如国家卫健委在公布三家试剂盒采购公司的同时也宣布，第三方检测机构为深圳华大基因科技有限公司。
In addition, there are more complex situations, such as the announcement of three kits procurement companies by the National Health Care Commission, also announced that the third-party testing agency is Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co. Ltd.
。
.
对此，华大基因对界面新闻表示，华大基因作为检测机构所承担的责任在于：以上3家试剂盒均为RTPCR法，但如果遇到病毒持续变异或者宿主背景复杂，或者需要组装成病毒基因组，仍然需要用高深度测序。
In response, Huada Gene told Interface News that its responsibility as a testing facility lies in the fact that all three kits are RTPCR-based, but still require high-depth sequencing if the virus continues to mutate or has a complex host background or needs to be assembled into a viral genome.
两种方法互相配合，即能快速判断，又能积累病毒基因组数据。
The two methods complement each other and can quickly judge and accumulate virus genome data.
华大基因本身也有对应试剂盒，但其他机构均无应急病原基因组高深度测序能力。
Huada gene itself has a corresponding kit, but other mechanisms do not have the ability of high depth sequencing of the pathogen genome.
有一个比喻：“RTPCR法是钓鱼，基因深度测序是一网打尽。
There is a metaphor: "RTPCR fishing, gene depth sequencing is a catch.
”。
"
由此推断，而一些不具备检测能力与检测条件的医院，自然也不会有检测试剂盒了。
From this inference, and some do not have the ability to detect and test the conditions of hospitals, will not have test kits.
。
.
业内人士分析，对于一般三级医院来说，PCR检测与实验室应该都是有多年操作经验了，基本不成问题，不过在目前医院病人爆发式出现的情况下，可能会有人力不够的问题。
For general level III hospitals, PCR testing and laboratory should be years of experience, basically no problem, but in the current outbreak of hospital patients, there may be a shortage of manpower.
。
.
但他也认为，如果病人越来越多，除了病毒分子检测，后续的影像、血清检测工作“不下沉到一线医院是不行的”。
But he also believes that if more patients, in addition to viral molecular testing, follow-up imaging, serum testing "do not sink to the first-line hospital.
