随着疫情消息的增多，各种关于其来源、如何传播与防控的“传言”也接踵而来。
As the spread of the epidemic has increased, so have the "rumors" about its origin, how it is spread and how it is controlled.
为此，我们采访了相关领域的专业人士，试图解答十个公众最为关心的问题。
To this end, we interviewed professionals in the field and tried to answer ten of the most important public concerns.

Reporters & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
截至1月23日24点，全国新型冠状病毒感染肺炎已确诊830例。
As of 24: 00 on January 23, 830 cases of new coronavirus-infected pneumonia have been diagnosed nationwide.
而可能稍微值得宽慰的一点是，从1月20日开始，中国各地终于开始日益重视这起疫情了。
And, perhaps somewhat reassuringly, since January 20, China has finally begun to pay increasing attention to the epidemic.
1月22日的上海虹桥火车站内，不少春运旅客都选择了佩戴口罩。

为此，《第一财经》YiMagazine采访了研究病毒基因组的科研人员、流行病专家、公共卫生研究者、卫健委内部人士以及城市科学研究者茅明睿等各领域人士，试图解答十个你最为关心，但可能仍充满疑惑的问题。
To that end, First Finance Yi Magazine interviewed researchers working on viral genomes, epidemiologists, public health researchers, health-care insiders, and urban science researcher Mao MingRui, trying to answer ten questions that you most care about but may still be full of doubts.
01遇到这样的传染病疫情，中国的医疗体系应该怎么运转起来？应对传染病的体系由许多部门组成。
How should China's healthcare system function in the face of such an epidemic? The system for dealing with infectious diseases is made up of many departments.
各级疾控中心（疾病预防控制中心）可能是其中的核心。
CDC levels (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) may be at the heart of this.
它是一个由政府全资拨款的事业单位，各级卫健委所属。
It is a wholly-owned government-funded institution, under the health care committee at all levels.
应对传染病是它的重要职责。
It has an important responsibility to deal with infectious diseases.
它有技术力量，有可以检测病原体的实验室，也有从事流行病学调查的专业人员。
It has technical capacity, laboratories where pathogens can be detected, and professionals who conduct epidemiological investigations.
如果出现传染病疫情，处理方式大致是这样的：1）医生发现法定传染病；2）医院通过网络系统上报给地方疾控中心；3）疾控中心会派流行病学的调查人员，了解接触史等信息；4）调查人员还会采集病人的样本，让专业的实验室分析病原；5）调查和检测的结果都会形成报告，再报给卫健委；6）一般的传染病可能到此为止，但如果事情更严重，可能会触发相关预案。
In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, the treatment is basically as follows: 1) the doctor detects a statutory infectious disease; 2) the hospital reports to the local CDC through a network system; 3) the CDC sends epidemiological investigators to study the history of exposure; 4) the results of the investigation and testing are reported to the CHRC.
如果要调动医院的床位、医生、增加防护、隔离、转移病人，这些事情就不归疾控中心负责了。
If the hospital beds, doctors, additional protection, isolation, transfer patients, these matters are not the responsibility of the CDC.
卫健委会通过专门管理医院的医政处下发通知；7）当出现值得注意的异常状况，卫健委会很快抽调全国的相关专家，成立专家组，他们会直接向政府提出各方面的处理建议。
The Health and Wellness Commission issues circulars through the Department of Medicine, which specializes in the management of hospitals. 7) When unusual circumstances arise that warrant attention, the Health and Wellness Commission quickly draws on relevant experts from all over the country to set up a panel of experts who will make recommendations directly to the Government on various aspects of the treatment.
就像这次这样。
Just like this one.
各地政府编制的应对公共卫生事件的预案中，都考虑到了新传染病和尚未发现的传染病情况，但这种情况下，能否及时上报、调查和处置，更多就靠医疗体系和当地政府的经验和执行能力。
New infectious diseases and undetected infectious diseases are taken into account in plans prepared by local governments to respond to public health events, but in such cases timely reporting, investigation and disposal depend more on the experience and implementation capacity of health systems and local governments.
这时，反应速度就成了关键。
At this point, speed of response becomes the key.
02如果我身处医院的发热门诊，医院将如何降低我的被感染概率？首先，医院会强化清洁消毒管理的工作，比如加强诊疗环境的通风。
If I am in a hospital's fever clinic, how will the hospital reduce my risk of infection? First, the hospital will step up its cleaning and disinfection management, such as enhancing ventilation in the clinical setting.
有条件的医疗机构会实行空气消毒，也可配备循环风空气消毒设备。
Conditional medical institutions will carry out air disinfection, may also be equipped with circulating air disinfection equipment.
对诊疗环境、医疗器械、患者用物等也都会做清洁消毒。
Diagnosis and treatment of the environment, medical equipment, patients will also do cleaning and disinfection.
其次，医院应该尽量减少患者的拥挤，以减少医院感染的风险。
Second, hospitals should minimize overcrowding in order to reduce the risk of hospital infections.
发现疑似或确诊感染新型冠状病毒的患者时，依法采取隔离或者控制传播措施，并按照规定对患者的陪同人员和其他密切接触人员采取医学观察，以及其他必要的预防措施。
When a patient suspected or confirmed to be infected with a new coronavirus is found, measures shall be taken to isolate or control the transmission of the coronavirus in accordance with the law, and medical observation and other necessary preventive measures shall be taken against the escort and other persons in close contact with the patient.
不具备救治能力的时候，及时将患者转诊到具备救治能力的医疗机构。
When the ability of treatment is not available, timely referral to a medical institution with treatment capacity.
近期，医疗机构还会帮助就诊患者及其陪同人员积极了解新型冠状病毒防护知识教育，指导其正确洗手、咳嗽礼仪和居家隔离等。
Recently, medical institutions will also help patients and their escorts to actively understand the new coronavirus protection education, guide them to wash their hands correctly, cough etiquette and home isolation.
03我们经历过SARS了，有什么经验是对这次疫情的处置有帮助的？现在中国的传染病防治体系，基本是在2003年的SARS疫情后建立起来的。
We have experienced SARS, what experience has helped us to deal with this epidemic? Now China's infectious disease control system was basically set up after the SARS epidemic in 2003.
《传染病防治法》是在2004年实施的。
The Communicable Diseases Act was introduced in 2004.
在其中，第一次确定了几个重要原则，比如所有医院的传染病病例，都必须上报卫生部门，而此前，军队所属医院没有这个义务；又比如，在这部法律中，第一次提出了“乙类传染病，采取甲类传染病的预防、控制措施”的方法，这确保了对新型传染病能采取足够强有力的防控措施。
For the first time, several important principles have been identified, such as that all cases of infectious diseases in hospitals must be reported to the health sector, whereas previously military hospitals were not obliged to do so; for example, the law for the first time introduced the method of "prevention and control measures for Class B infectious diseases," which ensures strong enough control measures against new infectious diseases.
这次的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎，也是按照此标准。
This time the new coronavirus infection of pneumonia is also in accordance with this standard.
另外，在2003年之后，中国政府的医疗卫生支出增幅迅速增加。
Moreover, after 2003, the government's health-care spending increased rapidly.
2003年是1116亿元，2018年时比这个数字翻了13倍。
The figure was 111.6 billion yuan in 2003 and 13 times that figure in 2018.
*卫生总费用＝政府卫生支出＋社会卫生支出＋个人卫生支出卫生总费用、政府卫生支出等定义及计算方式详见>>国家统计局卫生和社会服务指标解释如今，每个省市会有专门的接收传染病患者的医院。
:: Total health expenditure = government spending on health + spending on hygiene + total health expenditure, government health spending, and how it is defined and calculated. & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & # 160; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;
平时，它们会收治各类病人，而当其他医院出现了特定的传染病时，一般会转诊到这里，以及其他定点医院，比如肺结核、艾滋病等。
They treat a wide range of patients and are referred to other hospitals for specific infections, as well as to other designated hospitals, such as tuberculosis and AIDS.
而当出现了像SARS这样的疫情时，它可以第一时间建立起隔离病房。
And when there is an outbreak like SARS, it can set up the isolation ward in the first place.
比如上海的公共卫生中心，它就是在SARS疫情后建立的，医院内的草坪下都埋好了管道，应急的时候可以直接搭起板房当临时病房，用来集中隔离治疗。
Shanghai's public-health center, for example, was built after the SARS epidemic, with pipes laid under the hospital's lawns, and a makeshift ward that can be used for centralized quarantine when needed.
04到现在为止，我们面临的情况比SARS时期更严重吗？传染病的疫情传播是个充满变量的模型。
So far, are we facing a more serious situation than we faced during the SARS period? The spread of infectious disease is a variable model.
疾病本身的传播属性、所在地的人员密度、人员流动情况、防治措施的采取时间、天气都会产生影响。
The nature of the spread of the disease itself, the density of people in the area, the movement of people, the timing of interventions, and the weather all have an impact.
所以没法完全类比，但有几个时间点可以参考。
So there is no complete analogy, but there are a few points in time to look at.
所有传染病的防治都可以靠“三板斧”解决：1）控制传染源；2）切断传播途径；3）保护易感人群。
All infectious diseases can be treated with a "triple ax": 1) control the source of infection; 2) cut off transmission routes; and 3) protect vulnerable populations.
这三件事，每件都是越早做到越好。
The earlier you do each of these three things, the better.
在第一件事上，这次我们的动作比SARS时候快。
The first thing we did this time was faster than SARS.
12月30日，武汉卫健委医政医管处发布《关于做好不明原因肺炎救治工作的紧急通知》，称12月以来，武汉开始出现不明原因的肺炎。
On December 30, Wuhan Health Commission Medical and Medical Administration issued the "Emergency Notice on the Treatment of Unknown Causes of Pneumonia," saying that since December, Wuhan began to appear unknown causes of pneumonia.
1月7日，疾控中心的专家已经分离出了新型冠状病毒；1月10日，复旦大学公共卫生中心的张永振教授团队就在全球病毒研究的学术网站上发布了病毒的全基因组序列。
On January 7, CDC experts isolated the new coronavirus, and on January 10, a team of professors Zhang Yongzhen of the Fudan University Center for Public Health published a genome-wide sequence of the virus on the global virus research academic website.
也就是说，从疾病出现，到确认病原体，只用了不到1个月的时间。
That is, from the onset of the disease to the identification of pathogens, it took less than a month.
而SARS疫情，用了5个月，才由国外的科学家检测出冠状病毒，并由世卫组织确认其为病原体。
The SARS outbreak took five months for scientists from abroad to detect the coronavirus, which WHO identified as the pathogen.
接下来，就是针对病原体和疾病的特性，迅速防控了。
Then there are the characteristics of pathogens and diseases, which are quickly controlled.
这不单是医疗卫生体系的事，因为信息公开、疫情管控、动员等工作，需要政府统筹来完成。
This is not just a matter for the health system, because information disclosure, disease control and mobilization efforts need to be coordinated by the Government.
但1月11日开始，武汉市卫健委发布的确诊病例就一直是41例，直到1月16日，升至45例。
But since Jan. 11, the number of confirmed cases from Wuhan Health Commission has been 41, rising to 45 as of January 16.
1月20日，中国卫健委将这个疾病纳入了法定传染病范围。
On January 20, the Chinese health committee added the disease to the list of legal infectious diseases.
Play▲记者：第一财经 吴绵强05“武汉肺炎”在波及全国之前，为什么没有先在湖北省境内爆发？关于这个问题，城市象限创始人兼CEO 、北京市城市规划设计研究院云平台创新中心秘书长茅明睿及其团队通过2018年至2019年的“腾讯迁徙数据”与其他数据的综合研究，给出了一些有意思的讨论视角——1）湖北省内各市，以及岳阳、信阳、九江等湖北周边地市，都应该加强对来自“武汉都市圈”（注：以武汉为中心，覆盖黄石、鄂州、黄冈、孝感、咸宁、仙桃、潜江、天门等周边8个大中型城市所组成的城市群）的长途大巴乘客的排查。
Wu Mianqiang 05 "Wuhan Pneumonia" Before affecting the whole country, why did not the first explosion in Hubei Province? On this issue, city quadrant founder and CEO Mao MingRui, Secretary-General of the Cloud Platform Innovation Center of Beijing Institute of Urban Planning and Design and other data.
这是因为，都市圈内的城市跟中心城市有日常的高频联系，甚至是通勤联系。
This is because the city within the metropolitan area has daily high-frequency connections, even commuting links, with the central city.
但在目前湖北省披露的疫情数字中，只报告了黄冈市的情况，所以湖北省内疫情存在着被低估或者未被有效统计的可能性。
However, only Huanggang city has been reported in the current epidemic figures in Hubei Province, so there is a possibility that the epidemic situation in Hubei Province is underestimated or not effectively counted.
2）北京、上海、成都、广州、长沙、襄阳、荆州、宜昌等城市，应该加强排查来自于武汉的铁路客源；北京、昆明、沈阳、成都等城市，还要加强排查来自武汉的航班。
2) In cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Changsha, Xiangyang, Jingzhou and Yichang, the number of rail passengers coming from Wuhan should be strengthened.
在这些城市中，长沙、昆明都是与武汉联系度较高、但目前疫情人数还比较少的新一线城市。
Among these cities, Changsha and Kunming are new first-tier cities with high links to Wuhan but few epidemic numbers.
这两个城市又是各自都市圈的中心城市，也是城市群的重要节点，所以这两个城市如果暴发疫情，存在一定的扩散能力。
These two cities are the center of their metropolitan area and important nodes of urban agglomerations, so there is a certain capacity to spread if outbreaks occur in these two cities.
3）被“武汉肺炎”扩散到的北京、上海、广州、深圳这几个一线城市，医疗条件好，信息透明度高，以及有抗非典的经验，民众自我防护意识也很高，所以情况相对乐观。
3) The spread of Wuhan Pneumonia to the first tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, with good medical conditions, high levels of information transparency, and SARS experience, as well as a high level of self-defense awareness, the situation is relatively optimistic.
在介绍目前的这一分析结果之外，茅明睿还特别强调，目前疫区一定要披露细致的公开数据，这样才能有效增加疫区所在地市民的自我防护意识。
In addition to presenting the results of the current analysis, Mao also stressed that the current epidemic area must disclose detailed open data, so as to effectively increase the local people's awareness of self-defense.
而目前按照省来公开数据的做法，既不利于市民防护，又不利于各界做出适当的应对，也不利于学者开展有价值的研究。
The current practice of making data publicly available by province is not only detrimental to public protection, but also to appropriate responses and valuable research by scholars.

2007-9-25 21: 48 How much longer will it take for the vaccine to go from research and development to the market and then to consumers to reach consumers? When SARS broke out, Mr. Zhong proposed the hormone-impact therapy, which was widely used in SARS emergency treatment.
但这也导致很多患者病愈后出现股骨头坏死症状，以及产生肺部功能障碍和其他药物副作用反应。
But it also causes necrosis of the femoral head and lung dysfunction and other side effects of drugs in many patients.
在获得新型冠状病毒的基因组序列后，目前，美国包括卫生研究院、休斯顿贝勒医学院，以及得克萨斯、纽约等团队，加拿大萨斯喀彻温大学，以及中国的一个科学家团队都已经开始着手研发相应疫苗。
With the new coronavirus genome sequence now available, teams from the US, including the Institut of Health Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and teams from Texas and New York, the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, and a team of Chinese scientists have all begun to develop vaccines.
贝勒医学院的疫苗科学家彼得·霍特兹表示，“冠状病毒是一个相对简单的疫苗靶点。
"The coronavirus is a relatively simple vaccine target," said Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine.
”所以，其研发难度要低于针对艾滋病病毒或流感等其他病毒的疫苗。
So it is less difficult to develop than vaccines against other viruses, such as HIV or flu.
疫苗开发完成后，预计还要用几个月时间做第一阶段临床试验，正式投放市场要等到一年多以后。
After the vaccine is developed, it is expected to take several months to complete the first phase of clinical trials, and it will take more than a year for the vaccine to go on the market.
072020年的新型冠状病毒，和SARS病毒相比“新”在何处？此前我们已知的人类冠状病毒共有六种：其中四种冠状病毒在人群中较为常见，致病性较低；另外两种就是SARS冠状病毒和MERS冠状病毒，都可引起严重的呼吸系统疾病。
Where is the new coronavirus in 2007-2020 compared to the SARS coronavirus? There are six previously known coronavirus in humans: four coronavirus are common and less pathogenic in the population; the other two coronavirus SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus can cause severe respiratory disease.
此次发现的新型冠状病毒，不同于已发现的所有人类冠状病毒。
This discovery of a new coronavirus, different from all the human coronavirus has been found.
2020年1月10日，复旦大学的张永振教授团队在科研网站virological.org首次公布了武汉新型冠状病毒基因组序列。
On January 10, 2020, Professor Zhang Yongzhen of Fudan University released the first genome sequence of Wuhan coronavirus on the scientific research website virological.
基于该基因组序列，中国科学院上海巴斯德研究所郝沛研究员及其团队于1月21日发布了一项名为《武汉新型冠状病毒进化来源和传染人分子作用通路》的研究成果。
Based on the genome sequence, Hao Pepi, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, and his team released a study on January 21 called "The Evolution of Wuhan's New Coronavirus and Pathways to Infection Human Molecules."
在该论文里，郝沛研究员及其团队揭示了新型冠状病毒的进化来源，以及该病毒与SARS冠状病毒、MERS冠状病毒之间存在着遗传进化关系。
In this paper, Hao Pui researchers and his team revealed the evolutionary origin of the new coronavirus and the genetic relationship between the virus and SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus.
新型冠状病毒与SARS病毒的致病机制也类同，都是一种免疫病理反应——当病毒进入体内后，病毒会寄生在活细胞内，诱使人体的免疫细胞开始攻击自己的细胞，由此导致严重的炎症反应。
The new coronavirus, which is similar to the SARS virus, is an immunopathological response. When the virus enters the body, it will infect living cells, inducing the body's immune cells to attack their own cells, leading to a serious inflammatory response.
08新型冠状病毒到底从哪来，它的传染性和变异性如何？2003年“SARS”爆发后，研究者们发现SARS冠状病毒的传播途径是“蝙蝠-果子狸-人”，而后国际社会发现蝙蝠是冠状病毒的大本营。
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers discovered that the transmission route of the coronavirus is "bat-civet-man," and the bat was found to be the base of the coronavirus.
此次，郝沛团队通过将新型冠状病毒、SARS冠状病毒与MERS冠状病毒做全基因组比对发现，这几种病毒有着共同的祖先。
This time, Hao Pai's team identified the coronavirus, SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus as a genome-wide comparison and found that the viruses have a common ancestor.
由此推测，武汉冠状病毒的自然宿主也可能是蝙蝠。
It is speculated that the natural host of Wuhan coronavirus may also be bats.
1月22日，北京大学、广西中医药大学、宁波大学等机构在Journal of MedicalVirology 杂志上联合发表的论文则认为，蛇是造成当前武汉新型冠状病毒2019-nCoV感染爆发的最可能的野生动物库。
According to a paper published in the Journal of Medicine on January 22 by Peking University, Guangxi TCM University and Ningbo University, the snake is the most likely wildlife bank to cause the current Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak.
也就是说，此次新型冠状病毒，可能经历了从“蝙蝠-蛇-人”的传播路径。
In other words, this new coronavirus, may have undergone a "bat-snake-human" transmission route.
通过郝沛团队的研究我们发现，新型冠状病毒与SARS病毒的致病机制类同，新型冠状病毒是通过S-蛋白与人ACE2相互作用，来感染人的呼吸道上皮细胞，这意味着从病毒角度提供了可人传人的依据。
Through Hao's research, we found that the new coronavirus is similar to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS virus. The new coronavirus is infected with human respiratory epithelial cells through S-protein interaction with human ACE2, which means it provides a basis for human-to-human transmission from a viral perspective.
钟南山院士在接受央视新闻频道《新闻1+1》栏目采访时，向公众确认了新型冠状病毒会“人传人”。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan in the CCTV news channel "news 1 + 1" column interview, confirmed to the public that the new coronavirus will "human-to-human."
1月21日，世界卫生组织官员在接受《新京报》采访时仍表示，最新报告的感染信息“目前尚无明确的证据表明（新型冠状病毒可以）持续人传人”。
In an interview with the Beijing News on January 21, World Health Organization officials said the newly reported infection "does not yet have clear evidence that the coronavirus can continue to be passed from person to person."
按照长期研究病毒性新发性传染病的香港大学公共卫生学院副教授朱华晨的说法，就是“毒传一两代就断了”，难以实现高效传播，甚至超级传播。
According to Zhu Huachen, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong School of Public Health, who has long studied viral new infectious diseases, "a generation or two of virulence is dead," making efficient transmission or even super-transmission difficult.
而在1月22日公布最新病例数据时，国家卫健委副主任李斌表示，新型冠状病毒还存在变异的可能。
When the latest case data was released on January 22, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Council, said the new coronavirus could still mutate.
当地时间1月22日上午，世界卫生组织在日内瓦召开了紧急情况委员会会议。
On the morning of January 22, the World Health Organization (WHO) held a meeting of the Emergency Committee in Geneva.
经过两日讨论，世卫组织在当地时间1月23日晚、北京时间1月24日凌晨举行的新闻发布会上宣布，目前暂时不会将新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情界定为“国际关注的突发公共卫生事件”。
After two days of discussions, WHO announced at a press conference on the evening of January 23, local time and the early hours of January 24, Beijing time, that it would not define the new coronavirus pneumonia as a "public health emergency of international concern."
而根据《国际卫生条例》的定义，“国际公共卫生紧急事件”是指“通过疾病的国际传播构成对其它国家的公共卫生风险”，并可能需要采取协调一致的“国际应对措施”的“不同寻常”的事件。
The IHR defines an "international public health emergency" as "an" extraordinary "event that" poses a public health risk to other countries through the international spread of disease, "and may require a coordinated" international response. "
自2000年代中期实施该规则以来，仅就甲型H1N1流感、脊髓灰质炎疫情、埃博拉疫情和“寨卡”疫情宣布了五次。
Since the adoption of the Code in the mid-2000s, only five announcements have been made concerning influenza A (H1N1), polio, Ebola and Zika.
09此前有研究机构预测新型冠状病毒肺炎在武汉的已感染人数在数千人级别，是否可信？目前，交通数据、移动通信数据与社交媒体数据等非传统公共卫生数据都可以用来辅助测算乃至预测流行病的疫情风险。
09 Previous research has predicted that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan is now in the thousands, and that non-traditional public health data, such as traffic data, mobile data and social media data, can be used to help measure and even predict the risk of an epidemic.
在此次新型冠状病毒肺炎的相关疫情预测中，英国帝国理工学院的MRC全球传染病分析中心与香港大学公共卫生学院都是使用了武汉交通数据作为关键的建模依据。
Both the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC) of Imperial College of Technology and the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) used Wuhan traffic data as a key basis for modelling the new coronavirus pneumonia.
在MRC的研究方法中，主要是利用境外通报的已确诊病例，来反推武汉市内的情况，关键的模型参数有4个：境外已确诊病例数、每天从武汉机场出境的旅客数、武汉机场每日旅客数，以及病毒的平均潜伏期。
In the research methods of MRC, the key parameters of the model are four: the number of confirmed cases abroad, the number of passengers departing Wuhan airport every day, the number of passengers per day at Wuhan airport, and the average incubation period of the virus.
这4个参数的数据本身有一定的弹性（比如病毒潜伏期一般估算为10天，但也有可能是8天），所以测算出的已感染人数是一个很大的范围。
The data for these four parameters are inherently elastic (for example, the incubation period of the virus is generally estimated to be 10 days, but may also be 8 days), so the number of infected persons calculated is a large one.
利用1月18日政府的通报数据，MRC给出1月18日武汉的感染人数最大上下限范围分别为1000至9700人，标准参数下预测最大可能值为4000人。
Using government data from the 18 January notification, the MRC gave a maximum range of 1,000 to 9,700 for Wuhan on January 18 and a maximum of 4,000 for the standard parameters.
（MRC报告详见>>News / Wuhan Coronavirus）在1月22日的国务院办公室新闻发布会上，中国科学院院士、中国疾病预防控制中心主任高福对这一研究结果回应称：“大家知道，认识任何一个新生事物，尤其像这样的病毒，一定是‘事实是事实，知识理论是理论’。
(See MRC report at & gt; News / Wuhan Coronavirus, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press conference at the State Council's office on 22 January.
……我想随着大家对这个病毒的认识，会去验证这个模型。
I think that as you get to know the virus, you will test the model.
目前我们掌握的情况，并不是这位科学家计算的模型情况。
What we have now is not the model that the scientist has calculated.
”香港大学公共卫生学院1月21日发布的数学模型与MRC类似，利用的是1月17日政府的通报数据，并综合考虑了飞机、火车和公路运输的情况，推测出当日武汉的感染人数最大可能值为1343人，而武汉以外的其他省市最多有可能出现300则感染个案。
Similar to the MRC, the mathematical model released on January 21 by the Faculty of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong draws on government data from January 17 and combines air, rail and road transport to estimate the highest possible number of infections in Wuhan on that day at 1,343, with up to 300 in other provinces and cities outside Wuhan.
香港大学公共卫生医学讲座教授梁卓伟在1月21日同时表示，这一模型考虑到了近日武汉市和全球各城市的防疫措施，以病毒传播力较初期减75%为依据做乐观估算，到大年初七，国外将会增加1-2个感染个案，国内除武汉外其他省市感染个案最高可能增加70个。
A spokesman for the Department of Health said today (January 21) that the model took into account the anti-epidemic measures in Wuhan city and other cities around the world. Based on the initial 75% reduction in transmission rate of the virus, foreign countries will increase 1-2 cases by the end of the year.
但目前，香港大学公共卫生学院网站对于这则研究的相关披露已经增加了一条说明：“由于境外通报病例数在24小时内增加一倍，报告的研究已经不再有效，正在重新调整模型。
But a note has been added to the study published on the website of the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health: "As the number of notified cases outside the country doubles within 24 hours, the reported research is no longer valid and the model is being readjusted."
