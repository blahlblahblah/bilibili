本报记者 陈茂利 山东报道“通知我要求带着房产证和行车证来录入信息。
Our reporter Chen Maoli Shandong reported that "notice me to take the real estate certificate and the driving license to enter the information.
”山东省某县城一小区住户告诉《中国经营报》记者，在他去小区管委会办理门禁卡的时候，小区工作人员要求提供上述证明。
A resident of a small district in Shandong Province told China Business Daily that when he went to the district management committee to apply for a gate-ban card, the district staff asked for the certificate.
记者获悉，该住户前几年买了小区的房子，直到今年1月17日才搬过来住，但因为搬家事多加上临近春节，一直没有去办门禁卡。
The reporter learned that the household had bought a house in the district several years ago, until January 17, this year moved in, but because of the move, and the Spring Festival approaching, has not done so.
1月24日之前，开车进小区，跟门卫说一声住在哪个楼就可以了。
Before January 24, drive into the neighborhood and tell the doorman which building to live in.
但从1月25日（大年初一）开始，小区对进出入车辆开始严格检查。
But from January 25 (the first day of the New Year), the community began to enter and leave the vehicle strict inspection.
（小区工作人员在对进入小区的人员进行巡查）“社区防控是第一道防线，基层医疗卫生机构是我国医疗卫生服务体系的网底。
"Community prevention and control is the first line of defense, primary health care institutions are the bottom line of China's health service system.
一定要在地方政府的统一领导下，配合居委会村委会做好社区防控工作。
Must in the local government unified leadership, cooperates with the neighborhood committee village committee to do the community control work.
”1月27日，国家卫健委疾病预防控制局一级巡视员贺青华在《关于加强新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情社区防控工作的通知》有关情况举行的发布会上强调。
On January 27, Inspector He Qinghua of the State Council for Disease Control and Prevention stressed at a press conference on strengthening community control and prevention of pneumonia related to new coronavirus infections.
2月1日，农历初九。
February 1, the ninth day of the lunar calendar.
随着武汉疫情的蔓延，新型冠状病毒感染肺炎确诊病例的增加，山东省“自上而下”发起了一场病毒防护展，守护社区、村镇的每一个人成为这场战争的核心。
With the spread of Wuhan epidemic, the new coronavirus infection pneumonia confirmed cases of the increase, Shandong Province "top-down" launched a virus protection exhibition, guarding the community, the village everyone became the core of the war.
守好门，抗病毒农历大年初一，上午8点左右，记者的堂哥发来信息，“小叔、婶子，新年快乐，今天早上去给您们拜年，小区门卫建议返回，我就又开车回来了。
Good door, anti-virus Lunar New Year's Day, around 8 a.m., the reporter's cousin sent a message, "uncle, aunt, happy New Year, this morning to you to visit you, the residential guard recommended to return, I drove back.
”没多久，在当地中医院工作的外甥女打电话叮嘱称， “姨，您和姨夫，最近能不出门就别出门，和弟弟、妹妹呆在家里，天天用84消毒，要是出来一定要带好口罩，疫情发展比较快，我们过年也没有放假，就不去给您们拜年了。
"Not long after, my niece working in a local Chinese medicine hospital called to say," Auntie, you and your uncle will not go out recently, stay at home with your younger brother and sister, use 84 disinfectant every day.
”按照山东习俗，这一天，年轻人会挨家挨户给村里的长辈拜年。
According to Shandong custom, on this day young people visit their elders door to door in the village for the Spring Festival.
但2020年的这一天与往年不同，记者所在县的多个乡镇、社区采取“微信通知” “封路”“站岗查验”等方式拒绝走亲访友。
But this day in 2020, unlike in previous years, the reporter's county in a number of townships, communities to take "micro-letters notice," "blocked roads" and "station inspection" and other means refused to visit friends and relatives.
而对于这种“拒绝”，亲友间大都默契的用微信表达对亲友的祝福。
But for this kind of "refuse", the relatives and friends mostly tacit use the letter to express the blessing to the relatives and friends.
尽管拒绝探访并不是“热情好客”山东人一贯的风格，但确实是控制疫情所需。
Although denial of access is not the usual style of "hospitable" Shandong people, it is certainly needed to control the outbreak.
记者随即来到小区门口，看到原本只有一个值班人员看守的小区正门，增加了7～8个戴着口罩指挥交通的村民，几辆欲进入小区的车辆，和工作人员交流了几句又倒回去了。
Reporters immediately came to the gate of the small area, the original only a watch to watch the main door, increased the number of wearing masks to direct traffic villagers, several would-be into the community, and staff exchanges and back back.
“这几天，武汉疫情加剧。
"Wuhan epidemic has intensified in the past few days.
为了控制疫情，村委会决定，不让外来车辆及外来人员进入小区。
In order to control the outbreak, the village council decided not to allow foreign vehicles and people to enter the area.
”其中一位指挥交通的村民告诉记者，“大多数人都表示支持理解。
"Most people expressed support for understanding," one villager who directed the traffic told reporters.
”随后，记者走访小区各出入口发现，门口都张贴着红底黑字的通知：即日起，外来车辆及人员禁止进入小区，无卡车辆及返乡人员必须登记进入小区，为了他人的健康，请大家理解支持。
"Later, reporters visited the entrances and exits of the district and found signs in black and red letters on the entrances and exits:" Today, foreign vehicles and people are prohibited from entering the community.
此外，记者还发现，小区多个地方张贴着红底黑字的通告，要求从武汉、广州、北京等地返乡人员，到村服务大厅登记。
In addition, the reporter also found that many places in the community posted a red-bottom black letter notice, from Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing and other places to return to the village service hall to register.
1月27日，随着全国范围内新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎确诊病例增加，记者发现小区门口的工作人员不仅戴上了口罩，还穿上了医用白大褂。
On January 27, with a nationwide increase in the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, reporters found staff wearing not only face masks, but also medical white coats.
对进出小区的人员和车辆检查也更加严格。
Inspections of persons and vehicles entering and leaving the neighbourhood have also been tightened.
其实，不只是社区，记者通过多位亲友了解到，山东各乡村也采取“封路”来防控疫情。
In fact, not only the community, through a number of relatives and friends learned that Shandong villages have also taken "road closure" to prevent and control the epidemic.
大学生黄明亮（化名）告诉记者，“我们村查得很严，村门口都有站岗人员，村委会通过广播循环播放提示，对外来人员进入小区有明确的规定。
Huang bright university students (alias) told reporters, "We are very strict village check, there are posts in front of the village, village committees through radio circulation tips, to outsiders into the community has clear regulations.
”“也有特殊情况，如果有急事是可以进入的；若是单纯的走亲访友，或者是有湖北或路过湖北的车辆经过或驶入是不允许的。
"There are also special circumstances in which entry is allowed if there is an urgent matter; it is not permitted to visit friends or relatives simply, or to pass through or enter Hubei by vehicles passing by.
不过，会对外来人员进行询问和体温测量，并对交通工具进行消毒，再登记出入情况等信息。
However, visitors are questioned and their body temperature taken, and means of transport are disinfected and re-registered for information such as access.
”黄明亮告诉记者。
Huang told reporters.
（对有急事必须进入的外来人员需要进行消毒、测体温）另一村民告诉记者，“正月初二中午堵的路，禁止外庄的车辆和人员进入，因为我们隔壁两个村有武汉回来的人员，要观察。
Another villager told reporters: "The road blocked at noon on the second day of the first month forbids vehicles and people from the outside village to enter, because two villages next door have people from Wuhan to observe.
”据悉，除了有人在路口看守，他们村的主要道路已经被村民挖土堵住了。
The main road in their village has been blocked by villagers digging up earth, except for a guard at a junction, it is reported.
此外，为了让村民了解疫情的严重，村里每天循环播放约2个小时疫情防控措施。
In addition, in order to let villagers understand the severity of the epidemic, the village every day broadcast about two hours of epidemic prevention and control measures.
8点钟驶过的消毒车2月1日上午8点左右，小区内响起轰隆隆的车声。
Sterilization cart drove by at eight o'clock on February 1st at about 8 a.m. The rumble of cars rumbled through the area.
记者从窗户里看到，一辆抑尘车慢慢的在楼前驶过，车上装载有一个巨大喷射口，不断有柱状水雾喷出，地上湿漉漉的。
The reporter saw through the window that a dust-suppressor slowly drove past the building, loaded with a huge jetting orifice, a continuous column of water spray, the ground wet.
随后记者走出家门，空气中弥漫着消毒水味道。
Reporters then walked out of the house, the air filled with the smell of disinfectant.
（小区抑尘车每天8～10点在小区喷洒消毒液）“更安心了。
(The cell dust car sprays disinfectant at 8-10 pm daily in the neighborhood) "It's more reassuring.
”小区邻居分享了自己对喷洒消毒水的看法。
Neighborhood residents shared their views on spraying disinfectant.
另有居民表示，“喷洒消毒水很平常，我家里最近天天喷，但通过喷洒车大范围消毒，很给力。
Another resident said: "Spraying disinfectant is very common, my family recently spray daily, but through sprayer a wide range of disinfection, very powerful.
”一进入小区管委会办公大厅，记者便闻到浓浓消毒水的味道。
"Into the office hall of the neighborhood management committee, reporters can smell thick disinfectant.
带着口罩的管委会工作人员告诉记者，“小区从1月26日开始，一天喷3～4次消毒水。
"Starting from January 26, the neighborhood sprays three to four doses of disinfectant a day," MRC staff wearing masks told reporters.
”之后，记者看到，一位来办理业务的住户因为没有戴口罩，工作人员对其进行严肃劝说。
"Later, the reporter saw a household that had come to the business because it was not wearing a mask, and the staff was serious about persuading it.
上述工作人员告诉记者，小区里的住户外出大多数都选择戴着口罩，有少数老年人，接触外界信息少，防控意识差，无论怎么劝说，都不愿意戴口罩。
The staff told reporters that the residential community outside most choose to wear masks, there are a small number of elderly people, less contact with the outside information, poor awareness of prevention and control, no matter how persuaded, do not want to wear masks.
记者关注到，不少网友在微博上发起话题讨论：武汉疫情阴霾下，令人担心的长辈，死活不愿戴口罩。
Reporters concerned, many netizens in Weibo to initiate the topic of discussion: Wuhan under the haze, worried elders, reluctant to wear masks.
据悉，新型冠状病毒的传播途径主要有三种：口液、飞沫、接触传播，不戴口罩，相应的感染风险会增加。
It is reported that there are three main routes of transmission of the coronavirus: oral fluid, droplets, contact transmission, do not wear masks, the corresponding risk of infection will increase.
有资料显示，本次以武汉为中心向外辐射的疫情，死亡患者年龄偏大。
Data show that Wuhan as the center of the outburst of radiation, the death of the patient is too old.
江苏省卫健委新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防治专家组组长黄茂在接受媒体采访时分析称，“新型冠状病毒感染在老年人群体中死亡率偏高，主要是因为老年人有基础病，比如他们可能患有严重的肺部疾病。
"The new coronavirus infection has a high mortality rate among the elderly, mainly because the elderly have basic diseases such as the possibility of serious lung disease," Huang Mao, leader of the expert group on the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection, told the media.
而且老年人免疫功能差，恢复能力也弱。
Moreover, older persons suffer from poor immune functions and weak resilience.
”特色小吃街商铺停业疫情防控是一场没有硝烟、却丝毫不能懈怠的战争。
The epidemic prevention and control of the shutdown of the specialty snack shops is a war that has no smoke but no slack.
根据国家卫健委发布消息，截至1月25日24时，收到30个省（区、市）累计报告确诊病例1975例，同比1月24日24时增长53.46%。
As of 2400 hours January 25, 1975 cases of confirmed cases had been reported in 30 provinces, districts and cities, a 53.46 percent increase from 2400 hours on January 24, the National Health Commission said.
随着疫情迅速传播，1月26日，记者所在县发布了《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情防控指挥部令》2020第1号文件。
As the epidemic spread rapidly, on January 26, the reporter's county issued the "new coronavirus infection of the pneumonia command order 2020 No. 1."
文件指出，自1月26日16时起，县内除超市、医院、金融机构、农贸市场、加油站、婴幼儿用品店、药店正常营业外，以歌舞娱乐场所、游艺场所、影院、网吧、健身房等为代表的公共场所一律暂停活动。
Since 1600 hours on January 26, all public places in the county, such as supermarkets, hospitals, financial institutions, farmers' markets, petrol stations, baby shops and pharmacies, have been suspended, with the exception of places of song and dance, recreation centres, cinemas, Internet cafes and gymnasiums.
1月27日，记者所在县市场监督管理局下发通知，全县所有餐饮单位一律暂停营业，恢复营业时间等待通知。
January 27, the county market supervision administration issued a notice, the whole county all catering units are temporarily closed, resume business hours waiting for notice.
当天上午，记者对县城内一处知名景点兼小吃街走访发现，并无商户开业。
That morning, reporters to the county seat of a well-known scenic spots and snack street visit found, and did not open business.
记者从管理人员获悉，小吃街在接到上级暂停营业的通知后，133家商户随即便停止了营业。
Reporters learned from the management that after receiving the notice of the suspension of business at the upper level, 133 merchants immediately closed their business.
（特色小吃街的商铺停业防控疫情）“与年前预期人满为患的情况不同，现在小吃街基本上看不到人。
Unlike previous predictions of overcrowding, people are now largely invisible in the snack streets.
虽然工资与业绩挂钩，但在疫情严重的时候，可以在家里防控。
While wages are tied to performance, they can be controlled at home in times of severe epidemics.
还是很感恩的，觉得自己平安了。
Still very grateful that I feel safe.
”小吃街一家店铺工作人员在微信上告诉记者。
