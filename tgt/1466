燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 唐亚华编辑 | 魏佳“创业企业要警惕，不要倒在疫情结束后的‘倒春寒’上。
"Start-ups should be careful not to fall into the 'spring chill' that followed the outbreak," says Randall, a former creator of Futures Finance (ID: Rancaijing)
”在燃财经举办的线上沙龙上，金沙江创投主管合伙人朱啸虎对创业者发出预警。
At the online salon held by Jinsha Finance, the managing partner of Jinsha River, Zhu Wuhu, warned the entrepreneur.
他表示，疫情结束后，企业的运营数据恢复还需要两三个月，数据恢复之后再去融资又需要两三个月，所以从疫情结束到拿到钱可能还需要四到六个月时间。
He said it could take four to six months from the end of the outbreak to get the money because it will take two or three months for companies to recover their data and two or three months after the data recover.
创业者要做好最坏的打算，上半年收入会比较少，一定要做最保守的计划，控制好现金。
Entrepreneurs should prepare for the worst, earn less in the first half of the year, make sure they plan the most conservatively and keep their cash in check.
2月13日，“燃财经创新经济战疫计划”推出线上沙龙第二期——《穿越疫情，企业服务创业者该怎么做？》，金沙江创投主管合伙人朱啸虎、石墨文档创始人兼CEO吴冰、小鱼易连联合创始人兼CEO袁文辉围绕着企业服务的话题，在燃财经社群里进行了分享。
On February 13, Yuan Wenhui, the co-founder and CEO of FISH, launched the online salon II, "Crossing the Epidemic and Serving Entrepreneurs?," which was shared with the business community around the topic of corporate service.
朱啸虎提到，目前，面向中小企业的企服公司受到的冲击比较大，建议这类公司转换思路，尽可能赋能线下企业转战线上，把这次挑战变成机遇。
Zhu mentioned that, at present, small and medium-sized enterprises facing the service companies are more affected, and suggested that such companies change their thinking, as far as possible enabling offline enterprises to turn the challenge into an opportunity.
尽管相比于美国，中国的企业服务土壤要贫瘠很多，但企业服务行业资本利用率高，融资稀释少，对风险投资人价值更大，未来很大一批独角兽会出自企业服务类公司。
Although Chinese firms serve a much poorer soil than the US, the corporate services sector has high capital utilization, less dilution of financing, and greater value to venture capitalists, with a large number of future unicorns coming from corporate service companies.
此外，疫情之下，在线教育、生鲜电商都迎来了较好的机会，但现在也是考验企业产品和体验的时候，在订单量暴增的情况下，毛利率有没有改变是非常大的考验。
In addition, the epidemic, online education, live electricity business have welcomed better opportunities, but now is also a test of products and experience, in the face of orders surging, gross margin is a very big test.
面向中小企业的企服公司受冲击最大燃财经：企业服务是金沙江创投主要布局的赛道之一，在你的视野里，这次受到冲击比较大的是什么类型的企业服务项目？该怎么调整？朱啸虎：这次疫情的严重程度远超想象，可能打乱了很多创业公司的年度计划。
Companies facing SMEs are hit the hardest by the impact of business services: Business services is one of the main layout of Jinsha River, in your vision, what kind of business projects are more affected? How to adjust? Wuthering Tiger: This epidemic is far more serious than expected, and may upset the annual plans of many startups.
最近挑战比较大的，肯定是面向中小企业的这些企业服务公司，因为很多中小企业还没有复工，很难付款，但这是挑战也是机遇。
More challenging in recent times must be these SME-oriented business service firms, as many SMEs have not yet returned to work and it is difficult to pay, but this is both a challenge and an opportunity.
我建议这类公司转换思路，帮助他们的客户，比如一些线下连锁品牌，尽可能赋能它们做互联网生意，把这个挑战变成机遇。
I recommend that these companies change their mindset and help their customers, such as some off-line chain brands, do their best to empower them to do the Internet business, turning this challenge into an opportunity.
小程序最近也有了大爆发，企业服务的公司用小程序给这些企业赋能，里面有很多机会。
There has also been a recent explosion of small programs, where companies that provide business services empower them with small programs that offer plenty of opportunities.
核心观点还是必须要和客户共赢，要想客户所想，为他们创造更多的价值，帮助客户一起生存、发展下去，企业服务公司才能有更好的未来。
The core idea is to win-win with customers, to customers want to create more value for them, to help customers survive and develop together, corporate service companies can have a better future.
燃财经：什么类型的企业服务项目正在迎来机会？朱啸虎：年后很多企业都开始习惯了远程办公，疫情可能会让远程办公在中国形成一个大的习惯。
Fun Finance: What kind of business service projects are opening up opportunities? Mr. Zhu: After three years, many companies are getting used to telecommuting, and the epidemic may make telecommuting a big habit in China.
这可能是一个触发点，很多企业会用企业服务软件进行协调工作。
This can be a trigger point where many businesses use enterprise service software to coordinate their efforts.
燃财经：IM类、协同办公类、视频会议类的应用尤其火爆，但竞争也十分激烈，能否给这类型项目一些建议？怎么做才能把握机会、弯道超车？朱啸虎：IM协同办公和视频会议的企业非常火爆，这是给大家免费获客的时间，同时也是考验大家产品的时间，用户也会选择比较。
Fun Finance: IM, Office Co-op, Videoconferencing are especially popular, but competition is fierce. Can you give some advice on this type of project? How can you take advantage of opportunities and take turns to overtake?
如果产品比对手差的话，反而会受到更大的伤害，其中的核心还是产品和用户体验。
If the product is inferior to the opponent, but will suffer more harm, one of the core product and user experience.
燃财经：这会是假风口吗？你觉得疫情结束后，企业服务会快速发展还是会回到起点？朱啸虎：如果产品和服务真的非常好，我相信大量用户养成习惯以后，不会是假的风口，像电商一样，非典时候一下子迅速崛起，过后并没有回落，而且越来越加速渗透到人们生活当中。
If the products and services are really good, I believe that a large number of users will not become a fake air outlet. Like the electrician, SARS will rise quickly, but it has not fallen back and is becoming more and more popular in people's lives.
我相信企业服务也是一样的，如果产品真的好用，用户体验非常好，疫情结束以后，大家养成了习惯，还是会继续使用下去的。
I believe the same is true of corporate services, if the product is really easy to use, the user experience is very good, after the end of the epidemic, people have formed a habit, or will continue to use.
燃财经：你怎么看垂直行业的企业级服务，比如旅游行业SaaS、教育类、物流等，会不会因为受众面窄，价值就会低呢？朱啸虎：垂直行业的SaaS，一般看整个行业本身有多少GMV，然后看企业做SaaS能在里面提供什么价值、拿到几成收益，这就是企业的市场天花板，要首先看行业市场规模到底够不够大。
What do you think of vertical business services, such as SaaS, education, logistics, etc., that are less valuable because of the narrow audience?
燃财经：国内企业服务比较难做，因为传统客户对于这部分服务的习惯还不是很成熟，一般会压低价格，另外国外很多企业服务的产品相对成熟，从投资机构角度来说，你觉得是国内草根出来的公司成功概率高，还是从海外引入一些成熟产品再本地化成功概率高？朱啸虎：企业服务领域的“压价”现象确实是中国特色，这也是中国的企业服务土壤比美国要贫瘠很多的一个重要原因。
In addition to the relative maturity of many foreign companies' services, whether you think the probability of success of domestic grassroots companies is high, or the probability of relocalization of mature products from overseas is very high?
和消费互联网类似，在企业服务方面，中国的收费模式和美国模式也会有些差别。
Similar to the consumer Internet, there will be some differences between the Chinese and American models in terms of corporate services.
核心还是要看企业能不能给客户创造更多价值，提高用户粘性。
The core or to see if the enterprise can create more value to customers, improve the stickiness of users.
从收入里提成可能比单纯的收企业服务软件使用费更容易。
It may be easier to get a royalty on your income than it is to collect enterprise service software.
美国面向中小企业的CRM软件，一年至少可以收几千甚至上万美元，而中国面向中小企业的CRM软件可能一年一个企业只能收几千元人民币，但好处在于中国有三千万中小企业，数量非常大，所以可以卖得很便宜，同时把用户基础做大，后期靠新的功能点做增值服务增加收入。
While CRM software for SMEs in the United States can charge thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year, CRM software for small and medium-sized enterprises in China may charge only a few thousand yuan a year, but the advantage is that there are 30 million small and medium-sized enterprises in China.
燃财经：在企业服务方面，中美差异很大。
Flaming Finance: In the area of corporate services, China and the United States vary greatly.
美国诞生了很多百亿级的公司，但中国基本上没有，造成这种差异的主要原因是什么？朱啸虎：中美在企业服务方面最大差异还是时间点，美国企业服务是最近十年才发展起来的，所以中国目前的状况比美国晚十年左右也是比较合理的。
What are the main reasons for this difference? Zhu Wuhu: The biggest difference between China and the United States in the area of corporate services is still at the point in time, and US corporate services have only developed in the last decade, so it makes sense that China is now about a decade behind the US.
以前国内企业服务环境比较贫瘠，盗版软件非常多，一张盗版光碟就能买到很多软件，企业不需要花钱买软件。
Before the domestic enterprise service environment is relatively barren, pirated software is very many, a pirated CD can buy a lot of software, enterprises do not need to spend money on software.
但现在盗版光盘基本不存在了，所有的软件都在云端，企业或多或少都会买一些云服务，未来十年中国的企业服务软件一定会崛起。
But now pirated CDs are largely non-existent, all software is in the cloud, companies will buy some cloud services to a greater or lesser extent, and Chinese enterprise service software is bound to rise in the next decade.
燃财经：很多服务中小企业的公司因为客户遇到现金流危机而陷入困境，你觉得是不是需要在疫情后调整搭配不同规模的客户？朱啸虎：这一点是很难的，因为每个公司的基因不一样，面向大中型企业的公司需要非常强大的销售队伍，而面向中小企业，关键看产品和口碑传播能力。
Do you think you need to adjust and match customers of different sizes after an epidemic? Mr. Zhu: It's very difficult because companies with large and medium-sized enterprises need a very strong sales force, and for small and medium-sized enterprises, product and word-of-mouth ability is the key.
创业者不要倒在疫情结束后的“倒春寒”上燃财经：非典的时候你在忙什么？今年的感受跟当年有什么不一样？朱啸虎：非典时期我自己也在做企业服务的创业，主要为保险公司提供核心业务系统。
Founders should not fall into the financial crisis after the epidemic: What were you busy with SARS? How did you feel this year? Zhu Wuhu: I was also engaged in enterprise service during SARS period, mainly to provide core business systems for insurance companies.
那一年挑战确实非常大，因为不知道业务状况会怎么样，我们管理层每个月只拿5000元生活费。
It was a very challenging year indeed because we didn't know what the business would be like. Our management was getting only $5,000 a month for living expenses.
后来到年底公司结账发现有盈余，才补发了全年工资。
Later in the year the company closed the account found a surplus, only to make up the full year's wages.
疫情之下，每个创业企业都要精打细算，看手上有多少现金，能够支撑几个月，在没有看到清晰的收入的情况下，尽可能降低现金支出。
Under the epidemic, every startup has to think hard about how much cash it has, how much it can sustain for months, and keep its cash outlays as low as possible without seeing clear revenue.
燃财经：遇到问题的企业，你给他们的建议是什么？朱啸虎：对创业者来说，目前更重要的是要在这个情况下发掘新的机会点，尽快改变自己的模式去满足用户的心理需求，为自己创造更多生存条件。
What advice do you give entrepreneurs when they are in trouble? Mr. Zhu: For startups, it is more important to explore new opportunities in this situation, change their patterns to meet users' psychological needs and create more living conditions for themselves as soon as possible.
创业企业不要倒在疫情结束后的倒春寒上。
Start-ups should not fall in the wake of the epidemic on the cold spring.
即使疫情结束后，企业的运营数据恢复可能还需要两三个月时间，再花两三个月融资，所以从疫情结束到拿到钱可能还需要四到六个月时间。
Even after the outbreak is over, it could take two or three months to recover the company's operational data and another two or three months to raise money, so it could take another four to six months from the end of the epidemic until the money is available.
我给大家的建议是要做好最坏的打算，上半年收入会比较少，一定要做最保守的计划，控制好现金。
My advice to you is to prepare for the worst, make less money in the first half of the year, make sure you plan the most conservatively and keep your cash in check.
燃财经：疫情下哪些行业迎来利好？朱啸虎：在线教育企业可能是一个爆发期的机会，现在很多学校还没有开学，各省市都鼓励“停课不停学”，所以提供在线教育的企业数据都还是相当不错的，我们有些被投企业的服务器都爆掉了。
Now that many schools are not yet open and the provinces and municipalities are encouraging "non-stop learning," the numbers for companies offering online education are fairly good, and some of our servers have been popped out.
疫情对生鲜电商行业也是极大的利好，很多生鲜电商公司的订单都翻了两三倍以上，但是最终考验的还是它们能不能把单位经济模型走通。
The epidemic is also a big boon for the live-electricity industry, where orders from many live-electricity companies have more than tripled, but the ultimate test is whether they can model the unit economy.
以前这些生鲜电商的单位经济模型没走通，现在在订单量暴增到两到三倍的情况下，毛利率有没有改变，有没有变成正向，是非常大的考验。
The unit economic model of these fresh electricity business did not go through before, in the case of orders surging to two or three times, whether the gross profit rate has changed, or not, is a very big test.
燃财经：疫情对投资机构会有什么样的影响？朱啸虎：疫情对今年的投资肯定会有很大的影响。
Flaming Finance: What impact will the epidemic have on investment institutions? Wuthering Hu: The epidemic will certainly have a big impact on investment this year.
首先，上半年大部分投资人在帮助被投企业。
First, most investors helped the firms in the first half of the year.
另外，新的项目很难去尽调，而且运营数据可能受影响也比较大，新的项目比较难推进。
In addition, new projects are difficult to tune out, and operational data may also be affected, making it more difficult to move forward with new projects.
燃财经：2020年投资机构应该怎么做？朱啸虎：对投资人来说，同样也是危和机共存的情况。
Flaming Finance: What should investment institutions do in 2020? Wuthering Hu: For investors, it's also a case of crisis co-existence.
很多企业以前发展很好不需要融资，疫情下可能也需要考虑引入投资，投资者能投一些以前投不进去的项目。
Many companies have done well in the past without raising capital, and the epidemic may also require consideration for investments that investors can invest in previously untapped projects.
不过投资的核心还是看企业目前的困境到底是因为突发事件，还是它本身就面临挑战。
However, the core of investment depends on whether the enterprise's current predicament is due to unexpected events, or whether it faces its own challenges.
我们最近感兴趣的项目肯定是疫情中发展比较快的企业，如在线教育、电商项目，这些相对来说判断会容易一点。
The most recent projects we are interested in are certainly those that are growing faster in the epidemic, such as online education and telecom projects, which are relatively easy to judge.
如果企业本身受疫情打击比较大，目前投资判断会难一些。
If the enterprise itself is hit relatively hard by the epidemic, the current investment judgement will be more difficult.
同时对于去年发展非常好，不太需要我们的企业，我们也在密切关注它们目前的现金情况，看是不是需要帮助。
At the same time for last year's very good development, we do not need our enterprises, we are also closely watching their current cash situation to see if they need help.
燃财经：你被称为“独角兽捕手”，下一批独角兽项目会在什么领域出现？朱啸虎：中国的企业服务行业一直比较薄弱，互联网发展了20多年，中国的消费互联网公司总市值是美国消费互联网公司总市值的1/3左右，金融服务科技企业的市值约是美国同类公司的1/10，企业服务公司市值只有美国的1/100左右。
ZHOU: China's corporate services industry has been weak, the Internet has been growing for more than 20 years, the total market value of Chinese consumer Internet companies is about 1 / 3 that of US consumer Internet companies, the market value of financial service companies is about 1 / 10 that of similar US companies, and the market value of business service companies is only about 1 / 100th that of the United States.
美国的风险投资人在过去十年从企业服务领域上赚的钱远超过消费互联网，虽然美国有Snap chat、Uber、WhatsApp等一批优秀的消费互联网公司，但企业服务领域资本效率高，融资被稀释的比例少。
US venture capitalists have made far more money from corporate services over the past decade than they have spent on the Internet, and while the US has a number of excellent consumer Internet companies, such as Snap chat, Uber, and WhatsApp, corporate services are capital-efficient and their financing diluted to a lesser extent.
中国风险投资过去十几年赚的钱基本都是通过消费互联网，未来十年这个局面肯定会改变，中国风险投资人虽然从企业服务上赚的钱不一定能超过消费互联网，但是达到消费互联网一半的水平还是有可能的。
The amount of money Chinese venture capitalists have made in the last decade or so is likely to change over the next decade, and while Chinese venture capitalists may not be able to make more money from corporate services than they do on the Internet, it is possible to reach half that amount.
如果五到十年以后，中国的企业服务公司能做到现在美国企业服务公司市值的1/10到1/5，就意味着至少有50倍到20倍以上的发展机会。
If, in five to ten years, China's corporate-services companies can now account for one-tenth to one-fifth of the market value of US corporate-services companies, that means at least a 50-20-fold chance of growth.
未来很大一批独角兽会从企业服务的公司里面出来。
In the future, a large number of unicorns will come out of companies that serve businesses.
在线教育、休闲娱乐、企业服务2020年充满机会燃财经：你对2020年创投热点赛道有什么判断？朱啸虎：目前比较清晰的是在线教育、休闲娱乐、企业服务，这三个赛道依然充满机会。
Online Education, Recreation, and Business Services 2020: What do you think of the 2020 hotspot track? Mr. Zhu: The three tracks are still full of opportunities: online education, leisure and entertainment, and corporate services.
燃财经：你以前看消费互联网更多，现在看企业服务行业更多，为什么会有方向上的转变？你觉得消费互联网还有较大的创新机会吗？如果有，会是哪些方面？朱啸虎：中国消费互联网机会还是很大，未来十年中国投资人从消费互联网领域赚的钱还是比企业服务多。
Now why is there a shift in direction? Do you think there are more opportunities for innovation in consuming the Internet? If so, who will it be? Mr. Zhu: China still has a good chance of consuming the Internet.
因为中国的消费红利非常大，主要来自代际消费行为的变化。
Because China's consumption dividend is very large, mainly from the change of intergenerational consumption behavior.
我们看到很多互联网新兴品牌崛起，年轻人不再迷信大牌，开始相信自己喜欢的网红、主播代言的新品牌。
We have seen the rise of many emerging Internet brands, young people no longer superstition big card, began to believe their favorite network red, anchorperson's new brand.
外卖也是一样，十年前我们投资饿了么时对它的预期非常保守，但90后、00后不自己做饭造成了外卖的迅速爆发。
The same is true for take-out, where expectations were very conservative when we were hungry a decade ago, but not cooking by ourselves after 90 days or so led to a rapid take-out.
燃财经：最近几年宠物行业发展增速比较快，2019年宠物行业白皮书数据显示行业市场规模突破了2000亿。
Flaming Finance: Pet industry growth rate is relatively fast in recent years, 2019 pet industry white paper data shows that the size of the industry market exceeded 200 billion.
但因为行业的互联网化程度有限，此次受疫情冲击还是很大，你怎么看待这个行业？朱啸虎：宠物行业确实是非常大的机会点，中国宠物行业已经到了发展的拐点。
But what do you think about the industry, given the limited degree of Internet use and the impact of the epidemic? Zhu: The pet industry is indeed a great opportunity point, and the Chinese pet industry has reached the turning point.
90后、00后基本都是独生子女，他们需要宠物陪伴，而且中国家庭经济条件也到这个拐点了。
After 90, after 00 are basically only children, they need pets to accompany, and the economic conditions of Chinese families to this inflection point.
中国宠物目前渗透率比美国、日本都要低很多，我们非常看好宠物行业未来五到十年的发展。
China's pet penetration rate than the United States, Japan is much lower, we are very optimistic about the pet industry in the next five to ten years.
但是创业公司怎么切入很重要，我们看过很多创业公司很难找切入点。
But how startups cut in is important, and we've seen how difficult it is for startups to find entry points.
燃财经：这次线下娱乐受影响比较大，你觉得短、中、长期具体会有哪些影响，这些企业应该怎么尽量避免倒在“倒春寒”？朱啸虎：线下娱乐还是要具体看，最近有几家线下酒吧和抖音合作推出了云蹦迪，这是非常好的创新点，受影响的企业可以通过互联网自救。
(Cheers, applause.) (Fun Finance) (Fun Finance) (Fun Finance) (Fun Finance) What do you think the short, medium and long-term effects will be, and how should these companies try to avoid falling into the spring cold?
线下和线上娱乐结合在一起，有很多机会。
There are many opportunities to combine offline and online entertainment.
比如我们投资的剧本杀，它在线下有剧本杀门店，同时有线上APP，可以把现场的用户导到线上，疫情时线下店铺不能开，线上同样可以进行。
For example, we invest in screenplays that kill stores online, as well as APPs that channel users to the scene, prevent off-line shops from opening, and do the same on-line.
燃财经：这段时间大家的吃饭方式从外面的餐厅转到了家里，疫情结束以后，在家做饭的习惯能不能带火一些新的创业机会？朱啸虎：人的天性是懒惰的，自己做饭的良好习惯很难保持下去。
(Cheers, applause.) Cooking at home after the epidemic is over, can you bring some new opportunities for startups? Wuthering Tiger: People are lazy by nature, and it's hard to keep up the good habit of cooking themselves.
疫情结束后，很多人还会恢复以前叫外卖或到外面吃饭的习惯。
When the epidemic is over, many people will return to the old habit of ordering takeout or eating out.
当然，家里做饭的次数可能会比以前稍微多一些，但这种习惯会逐步淡化。
Of course, home cooking may be a little more frequent than before, but this habit will gradually fade.
燃财经：你怎么看互联网医疗的前景？是否会被资本市场认可？朱啸虎：互联网医疗肯定有非常大的前景，最近平安好医生、阿里健康等在资本市场表现都非常好，一级市场上也有很多好的公司在疫情里做贡献，这个肯定是未来的趋势，但挑战点在于互联网医疗到底从哪个点切入才能真正为用户创造价值。
Fun Finance: What do you think about the future of Internet medicine? Will it be recognized by the capital market? Wuthering Hu: Internet health certainly has great prospects. Recently, Ping An good doctor, Ali Health and so on are doing very well in the capital market.
燃财经： 动漫行业线下职业教育还有前景吗？朱啸虎：动漫职业教育还是很难纯线上化的，线下教育肯定有机会，而且动漫行业，也不仅是动漫本身，游戏也需要很多漫画的制作，需求量非常大，在中国很有前景。
Is there any prospect for on-line vocational education in the animation industry? Zhu Wuhu: Animation vocational education is still difficult to line up, there are certainly opportunities for offline education, and animation industry, not only animation itself, the game also requires a lot of cartoon production, demand is very large, in China has great prospects.
