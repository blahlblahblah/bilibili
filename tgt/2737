一位90后武汉姑娘无法忘却的28天武汉姑娘阿布终于盼到了自己快“毕业”的时刻。
Wuhan girl after 90 days can not forget 28 days Wuhan girl finally look forward to their own "graduation" moment.
3月1日晚上六点，阿布在她的小红书主页上发布了这一个月来的第67条视频。
At 6 p.m. March 1, Abu posted a month-old video of the month on her home page, Little Red Book.
她把眼睛凑近镜头，想让大家看清在她眼角打转的眼泪。
She put her eyes close to the camera to show the tears twisting in the corners of her eyes.
“我的结果是阴性。
"I came out negative.
我连续两次都是阴性了。
I've been negative twice in a row.
”（右二为阿布）这是阿布第五次做她称之为“高考”的核酸检测。
"(Abu on the second right) This is Abu's fifth nucleic acid test she calls the" college entrance examination.
前三次结果是阳性，意味着她要“再次复读”；连续两次阴性，说明她离毕业的日子——出院，去隔离点隔离两周，然后回家——越来越近了。
The first three tests were positive, meaning she had to "repeat it again"; two negative tests showed she was getting closer and closer to the day she left for graduation, spent two weeks in quarantine, and then went home.
最近这一个月发生的事，把阿布前面二十九年经历的小风小浪都比下去了。
The events of the past month have contrasted with the small waves Abu experienced in the previous 29 years.
她从来没有这么长时间独自一人离开家，离开她三岁的女儿，以及，接近生死。
She had never left home alone for so long, away from her three-year-old daughter, and, close to death.
虽然武汉在腊月二十九封城，高速运转的城市来了个急刹车，但直到一月底，阿布一家还是认为，不可能就这么“中招”吧。
Although Wuhan in the city of 29, high-speed operation of the city came to a sudden brake, but until the end of January, the Abramovich family still think it is impossible to "hit" it.
一月底，住在一起的婆婆和她，相继出现了鼻塞、喉痛、流虚汗的症状。
At the end of January, her mother-in-law and she developed symptoms of stuffy nose, sore throat and sweating.
随之而来的一个电话将整个家庭推向了恐惧：婆婆一月中旬一起打麻将的三个牌友确诊感染新冠病毒。
The resulting phone call sent the entire family into a panic: three friends who played Mahjong together in mid-January were diagnosed with the new crown virus.
几天后，婆婆确诊，阿布确诊。
A few days later, mother-in-law confirmed, Abu confirmed.
因为检测结果显示是“轻症，并已经在往治愈的方向走”，阿布于2月8日进入武汉客厅方舱医院。
Abu entered Wuhan's living room cabin hospital on Feb. 8 because the tests showed it was "mild and heading toward a cure."
与家人分别后，原本就经常在小红书看Vlog的阿布，也开始在上面发布视频，记录下于她于所有人而言都极为特殊的这段日子，也向外界关心自己的人汇报与新冠抗争的点点滴滴。
After parting from her family, Abramovich, who used to watch Vlog in Little Red Book, also began to post videos on it, recording what she considered to be a very special day for everyone, and reporting every bit of the struggle to the outside world to those who cared about her.
无数的网友在她的视频里，看到了那些被命运撞了一下的人，若干个或艰难或感动或温情的“日常”瞬间。
Countless netizens in her video, saw those who were hit by fate, a number of difficult or touched or sentimental "everyday" moment.
方舱的日与夜走进24小时灯火通明的武汉客厅方舱医院，已经是凌晨两点半了。
It was half past two in the morning when the sun and night entered the 24-hour wuhan living room square cabin hospital.
阿布用图片和视频记录着：她领到了一盒盒饭，一件军大衣，收纳箱；床上有两床被子、电热毯；饭不是太好吃；板房洗漱间，移动厕所几百人用，有点脏。
Abu recorded in pictures and videos that she had received a box of rice, a military overcoat and a container; two quilts and electric blankets on the bed; food was not too good to eat; and pantry washrooms, which were used by hundreds of people and were a bit dirty.
武汉客厅顾名思义，它是武汉这座城市为自己建造的大客厅，曾举办大型博览会、大型艺术展。
Wuhan living room as the name implies, it is Wuhan, this city for their own large living room, has held large-scale expositions, large-scale art exhibitions.
2月7日它由“厅”变“方舱医院”，开舱收治轻症新冠肺炎病人。
Feb. 7, it was changed from "hall" to "square cabin hospital", open space to treat patients with mild crowns pneumonia.
三天三夜“速成”的方舱医院，起初很多人担心服务设施跟不上。
At first, many feared that service facilities would not keep up with the three-day, three-day, "fast-track" cabin hospital.
再加上突然来到一个陌生的地方，看到几百张病床，普通人也难免恐惧和紧张。
Coupled with the sudden arrival of a strange place, to see hundreds of beds, ordinary people can not help but fear and tension.
阿布是首批入住患者，本以为她要适应一段时间。
Abramovich was one of the first patients to move in, expecting her to adapt for a while.
但在接下来的几天内，阿布的镜头拍下了方舱医院快速步入正轨并变完善的过程。
But in the next few days, Abu's footage captured the cabin hospital's rapid progress and improvement.
在方舱的第三天，吃完晚饭后，阿布床头旁边的扩音喇叭突然响起了一首草原民族风歌曲《火红的萨日朗》。
On the third day of the cabin, after dinner, a prairie folk song, "Flaming Sun Long," burst out on the loudspeaker next to Abu's head.
一位来自甘肃的护士带着大家跳起了舞。
A nurse from Gansu province danced with everyone.
这是方舱的医护人员为了缓解压抑的气氛，也让舱友们动起来提高免疫力想到的办法。
This is the cabin crew in order to alleviate the atmosphere of repression, but also let cabin friends to move up immunity to think of ways.
护士小姐姐跳得很专业，厚重的防护服并不影响她舞姿优美。
The nurse's little sister danced professionally, and her heavy protective clothing did not affect her graceful dance.
舱友们被舒缓又不失欢快的音乐和舞姿感染了，跟着跳了起来，并不断有人加入。
Hatch friends were soothing and cheerful music and dancing infected, then jumped up, and people continue to join.
看到跳舞的舱友脸上久违的笑容，阿布禁不住泪流满面。
Abu couldn't help crying when he saw the long-lost smile on the Dancing cabin mate's face.
“患病之际，总是容易被一些寻常事物打动。
"When you're sick, it's easy to be moved by the common things.
”阿布连忙拿出手机拍下了这段“方舱医院广场舞”上传到小红书。
"Abu quickly took out his cell phone and filmed the" Square Dance of the cabin hospital "and posted it to Little Red Book.
令她没想到的是，这段视频很快在小红书上收获网友几万个点赞，并在全网爆红。
To her surprise, this video soon picked up tens of thousands of comments from netizens on Xiao Hong's book and made a big hit on the net.
央视新闻也引用阿布的视频，第一时间做了跟踪报道。
CCTV News also cited Abu's video, the first time to do a tracking report.
随着视频流传广泛，阿布走在方舱里经常会被认出来，而在线上，无数素不相识的网友，也聚集在阿布的小红书笔记下，纷纷鼓励、祝福，每天还有网友“催更”，阿布在感动的同时也有了一种责任感，她称自己为“方舱战地记者”，立志要一直更新方舱里的真实生活。
As the video spread widely, Abu will often be recognized as walking in the cabin, and online, countless unknown netizens gathered under his notes, encouragement, blessing, and every day a sense of responsibility, she said, calling herself a "war correspondent in the cabin" and determined to keep updating the real life in the cabin.
之后阿布走到哪拍到哪，不停地寻找“新闻点”。
Then Abu went everywhere and kept looking for the "news point."
透过阿布的镜头，我们看到方舱有了读书角，三个大书柜，放着满满的新书；方舱的隔板上多了一棵“信心树”，大家把自己的期盼与祝福写在便签上，组成了树的叶子；方舱的饭也越来越好吃了，荤素搭配合理，还会定期发牛奶、酸奶、小面包，阿布记录道：“原本怕方舱伙食不好，后来发现是我想多了，来了方舱是要胖十斤的节奏。
There were three large bookcases full of new books. On the partition of the cabin there was an additional tree of confidence. They wrote down their wishes and blessings on the partitions of the trees
”方舱活跃氛围的方式也更多元。
The way the cabin is active is also more diverse.
来自全国各地的医疗队在这里献出了才艺：福建医疗队一首闽南语歌《爱拼才会赢》引发了全场大合唱；四川医疗队将民谣《成都》里的歌词改成了“和我在武汉的街头走一走”，惹得阿布再次流下了眼泪。
Medical teams from all over the country gave their talents here: Fujian Medical Team, a Minnan song, "Love Spelling Can Win," triggered a chorus; the Sichuan Medical Team changed the lyrics from the ballad Chengdu to "Walking with Me on the Street in Wuhan," causing Abu to shed tears again.
后来方舱还有了自助点唱KTV机，网友看到后在阿布视频底下留言：感觉你们不是去住院，是去参加了冬令营。
Later, the cabin has a self-help singing KTV machine, netizens saw the message under Abu video: I feel you are not going to the hospital, is to participate in the winter camp.
阿布注意到，方舱悄然发生着改变。
Abu noticed that the cabin was quietly changing.
作为一个临时居所，方舱不是家，但却越来越有了社区的氛围。
As a temporary residence, the cabin was not home, but there was a growing sense of community.
所有人都在努力改善着方舱内的生活环境。
Everyone is trying to improve the living environment in the cockpit.
刚进方舱时，最困扰阿布的移动厕所卫生问题也有了扭转。
Just entered the square cabin, the most troubled Abu mobile toilet hygiene problems have also been reversed.
“现在大家去洗手间时都会带上一盆水冲一下。
"Now everyone goes to the bathroom with a basin of water.
大家都能自觉维护，卫生情况就好了不少。
Everybody can defend consciously, the sanitation situation is good a lot.
”阿布把这些细微的变化都一一呈现在网络上，每篇小红书笔记都挤满了祝福和鼓励的留言，她的方舱记录也三次登上央视新闻，被数十家媒体转载。
"Abu shows the details of the changes on the Internet, with every little red-book note packed with messages of blessing and encouragement, and her cabin logs three times on CCTV news, reprinted by dozens of media outlets.
许多小红书网友在阿布的主页留言说，透过阿布的眼睛，看到了方舱医院最真实的“进化史”。
Many netizens to Little Red Book posted messages on Abu's home page saying that through Abu's eyes, he had seen the most authentic "evolutionary history" of the cabin hospital.
“生死之交”每当夜深人静，阿布回到方舱床上，望着天花板，一些思绪飘来又飞去。
During the dead of the night, Abu returns to his cabin bed and looks at the ceiling. Thoughts float back and forth.
她经常回看手机里的照片，重温女儿是如何一天天长大的。
She often looks back at the pictures on her cell phone to see how her daughter grows up.
有一张去年女儿三岁生日时拍的全家福，她看了无数遍。
She had a picture of her daughter's family taken on her third birthday last year, which she had seen countless times.
总有睡不着的时候。
There's always no time to sleep.
疫情阻断了社会关系，阻断了与亲人、朋友面对面交流的机会，漫长的隔离中，人难免会有孤岛一般的感觉。
Outbreak of social relations, cut off face-to-face communication with relatives, friends, long isolation, people will inevitably feel like an island.
但这样的情绪，也就限于那几个睡不着的夜晚。
But the emotion was limited to a few sleepless nights.
不管是方舱，还是线上的社区，帮助阿布重建了和远远近近人们的社会关系，令阿布获得了意想不到的精神支持。
Both the cabin and the online community helped Abu rebuild social ties with people far and near, giving him unexpected spiritual support.
阿布所在的舱区，大部分舱友年龄比她大很多，而医护中有不少同龄人，闲暇时阿布就与他们聊天。
In Abu's cabin, most of his cabin mates were much older than she was, and there were many of his contemporaries with whom Abramovich chatted in his spare time.
医护人员工作时不能带手机，阿布就帮他们拍摄“报平安视频”，让他们传给家人和院方，部分也发在网上，大家渐渐地就熟络起来了。
Instead of using their mobile phones when they work, Abu helps them make "safety videos" for them to pass on to family and residents, and some of them are posted on the Internet.
随着网上视频被越来越多人关注，医护人员不仅会配合阿布拍摄，有时还会主动找到她，通过她的视频表述自己的心意。
As more and more attention is being paid to online videos, medical staff will not only work with him, but will sometimes come to her and express themselves through her videos.
一位护士，在袖子上写下对爱人的祝福，请阿布拍下来发出去。
A nurse, writing her blessing on her sleeve, asked Abu to take a picture and send it out.
有一天晚上吃完晚饭后，阿布收到了一张“折起来的纸”，原本以为是医嘱通知，打开一看，没想到是一封鼓励信。
One night after dinner, Abu received a "folded paper," originally thought it was a doctor's advice notice, opened it, did not expect it is a letter of encouragement.
信出自安徽医疗队护士张婷婷之手，阿布曾给她拍过视频。
The letter was written by Zhang Tingting, a nurse with the Anhui medical team.
她在信里写道，“这些天看你的视频，为你的坚强、自信而感动！加油！爱笑的女孩运气不会太差。
She wrote in the letter, "These days to see your video, for your strong, confident and moved! Come on! Laughing girls will not be too bad luck.
”张婷婷和阿布年龄相仿，家里也有一个两岁的孩子。
Zhang Tingting is about the same age as Abu and has a two-year-old child at home.
两个年轻妈妈在牵挂家人和孩子之外，还要和病毒抗争，惺惺相惜。
Two young mothers in the care of family and children, but also with the virus, the sympathy.
阿布把张婷婷戴着护目镜的照片发在了网上，被张婷婷的家人和众多网友点赞。
Abul Zhang Tingting wearing goggles on the Internet photos, Zhang Tingting's family and a number of netizens praise.
两人也因此互留了联系方式，成为了朋友。
As a result, they kept contact with each other and became friends.
阿布还和两个广东医疗队护士组建了一个微信群，即使阿布2月27日从方舱转到中南医院，这个群没有一天停止过关心的询问。
Abu also formed a microcosm with the nurses of two Guangdong medical teams, who did not stop asking questions every day even after Abu was transferred from the cabin to the Zhongnan hospital on February 27th.
三人已经约好了，等疫情过去，要一起去撸串。
The three of you have an appointment to go there together when the epidemic is over.
阿布最初熟悉的是隔壁床的舱友们，随着视频的传播，越来越多舱友们成为她拍摄对象和朋友。
Abramovich was originally familiar with cabin friends in the next bed, and as the video spread, more and more cabin friends became her subjects and friends.
他们用乐观的调侃消解了阿布偶尔的负面情绪。
They used optimistic banter to defuse Abu's occasional negative mood.
2月20日，阿布得知自己第三次核酸检测结果还是阳性，心情一下子跌到谷底，和先生视频时还哭了会。
On February 20, Abu learned that his third nucleic acid test results are still positive, his mood suddenly fell to the bottom, and Mr.
阿布形容那是她的“至暗时刻”。
Abu describes it as her "darkest hour."
但也就是那么一早上的时间，舱友们纷纷过来开导她：方舱国家免费给吃，吃得那么好，多住几天有啥？到了下午，阿布的情绪就缓和了，“干掉了一整碗泡面”。
But in the morning, the cabin crew came over to enlighten her: The Fang country is free to eat, eat so well, what is the extra few days? By the afternoon, Abu's mood eased, "killed a whole bowl of noodles."
转院离开方舱那天，行李是舱友们帮忙收拾的。
On the day the transfer took place, the cabin crew helped to pack the luggage.
她来时是一个箱子，走时变成三大件，舱友们给她塞满了整整一箱的零食，担心在定点医院没有那么多吃的。
She came in a suitcase and left in three big things. The cabin crew stuffed her with a whole box of snacks, worried that there wasn't enough to eat at the designated hospital.
她与每个人隔空拥抱，并又录了一段视频，在说到“这是我最后一次在客厅方舱给大家录视频了”，她哽咽了。
She hugged everyone and recorded another video, saying, "This is the last time I recorded a video in the living room cabin." She choked.
“挺舍不得这里，还有些医护人员因为交接班没有来得及告别。
"I hate to be here. There are some paramedics who haven't had time to say goodbye.
”阿布说。
"said Abu.
一起唱歌，一起跳舞，聊天守望互助，结为“生死之交”，这在社区隔离点和定点医院或许是无法想象的事情，只有在方舱，才能提供这样的人际互动。
Singing together, dancing together, chatting, guarding each other, being "life-or-death friends" may be unthinkable at community isolation points and designated hospitals, but only in the cabins can such interpersonal interaction be provided.
来自小红书社区的陌生网友的鼓励，也带给阿布许多意想不到的慰藉。
The encouragement from unknown netizens from Little Red Book community also brought Abu a lot of unexpected comfort.
除了数不清的“加油”，有的网友每天都会发私信询问阿布的情况，有的则给她讲各种笑话逗她开心，有的网友问她地址想给她寄补品。
In addition to countless "refueling", some netizens sent personal letters asking about Abu, others told her jokes to amuse her, and some asked her address to send her supplements.
在和网友的交流中，阿布还认识了许多正在治疗和已经治愈的新冠患者，大家相互打气的同时，也交流治疗经验。
In a conversation with netizens, Abramovich also met many new crown patients who were being treated and who had already been cured, encouraging each other to share their healing experiences.
阿布被这些关心和爱护感动到落泪，但又会觉得有些“受之有愧”：她不是逆行的白衣天使，也不是坚守在疫情一线的工作人员。
Abramovich is moved to tears by these concerns and love, but feels "guilty": she is not a retrograde white angel, nor a staff member on the front line of the epidemic.
她只是一个被人照顾的患者，为何会得到如此多的关注。
She's just a cared-for patient and why she gets so much attention.
但一位网友给阿布的私信，令她些许释然。
But a netizen gave Abu a personal letter, let her a little relieved.
这位网友说，此前一直觉得病魔可怕，方舱医院“沉重”，但看了阿布的视频，他明白，疫情固然严重，然而阿布和方舱里的人们却是战胜疫情的希望。
The netizen said he thought the illness was terrible and the cabin hospital "heavy," but after watching Abu's video, he understood that the outbreak was serious, but the people in Abu and the capsule were hopeful that it would be overcome.
他虽然给阿布的视频点赞鼓励，但他自己也被阿布所鼓励。
While he praised Abu's videos for encouragement, he himself was encouraged by Abu.
“乐观和向上是我的良药，我把药方开给更多的人。
"Optimism and upward mobility are my good medicine, and I will prescribe them to more people.
”阿布说。
"said Abu.
近期，阿布又做了第六次核酸检测，正在等待出院的通知。
Recently, Abu made a sixth nucleic acid test and is waiting to be released from the hospital.
十天前，先生和女儿已经解除隔离回到了家里，婆婆和公公也分别从火神山和方舱医院出院。
Ten days ago, my husband and daughter were released from isolation and my mother-in-law and father-in-law were discharged from Mount Fire and Fang Cao Hospital, respectively.
春暖花开的日子就在眼前。
The days of spring blooming are here.
阿布也有了新愿望：一是要去捐血浆，因为看到新闻上说治愈患者的血浆对重症病人很有效；二是等一切恢复正常，她要和家人一起去甘肃、广东、安徽、福建游览一番，因为这是她所在的医院医疗队所属的地方。
Abu also has a new desire to donate blood plasma, seeing news that curing the patient's plasma is effective for patients in serious condition, and to travel with her family to Gansu, Guangdong, Anhui and Fujian, where her hospital medical team belongs.
虽然不知道这些愿望何时能实现，但阿布很确定，它们就躺在未来日历里的某一天。
Although Abu is not sure when these wishes will be realized, Abu is sure that they will lie in a future calendar one day.
3月2日，阿布在小红书上更新了一张图片，是从她所在的中南医院17楼往窗外看的夜景，东湖、水果湖尽收眼底。
On March 2, Abu updated a picture in Xiao Hong book, looking out of the window of her hospital in Zhongnan, East Lake and Fruit Lake.
夜色柔和静谧，湖面上流光溢彩，阿布邀请大家一起来欣赏。
The night was soft and quiet, and the lake was overflowing with color. Abu invited everyone to enjoy it.
“武汉真美。
Wuhan is beautiful.
”她写道。
