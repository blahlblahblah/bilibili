光头是精酿啤酒品牌 “18 号酒馆” 的主理人，他和他的酒馆被困在武汉，一场突如其来的传染病的阴影中。
The skinhead, the owner of the brewed brewery brand "Tavern 18," and his tavern are caught in the shadow of a sudden epidemic of infection in Wuhan.
和一位偶然被封锁在同一座城市的朋友一起，他们打开手机的拍摄功能，开始了一场毫无目的的城市漫游。
Together with a friend who happened to be locked up in the same city, they turned on their cell phone and began an aimless city ramble.
两人会全副武装地行进 23 公里，骑着电动车从汉口到光谷，就因为那曾是武汉人眼中的“宇宙中心”。
The two men will march 23 kilometers in full arms, riding electric cars from Hankou to Guanggu, because it was once seen by Wuhan people as the "center of the universe.
从他的描述中，我见到这座城市人潮褪去后的景象，一个身处险境的城市古怪、好笑、生猛的日常。
From his descriptions, I see the city fading away, a quirky, funny, fierce day-to-day life in a city in danger.
以下是他的自述。
The following is his account of himself.
图源于王粒丁我叫光头，2013 年，在武汉开了一家精酿酒馆，从未停止营业过，即使大年三十那一天晚上。
2007-9-19 19: 55 [hide] I'm Bareheaded. In 2013, I opened a brewery in Wuhan and never stopped trading, even on New Year's Eve.
2019 年，是我们快速发展的一年，新开了两家店铺，大家铆足了劲想冲击 2020。
2019, is our rapid development year, opened two new shops, we riveted enough to impact 2020.
今天是我们歇业的第 29 天，跟所有的餐饮行业一样，活着成为了我们 2020 年的唯一目标。
Today is our 29th day out of business and, like all restaurants, living is our only goal for 2020.
我们在 1 月 21 关闭了第一家店，那是疫情开始爆发的头几天，腊月二十七。
We closed our first store on January 21st, the first few days of the outbreak, on July 27th.
店里的人慢慢变少，员工人心惶惶，又临近过年，有些外地的员工被家里人催着回家。
The store slowly fewer people, staff panic, and approaching the New Year, some field staff members were urged home by their families.
于是，我们陆续关停了其他门店和酒厂。
As a result, we closed down other stores and wineries.
原计划春节营业期间安排了员工留守武汉，因为封城也回不去，好在后厨准备了充足的食材，够好一阵子的宅居。
Originally planned during the Spring Festival business arranged for staff to stay in Wuhan, because the closure of the city can not go back, but the chef prepared sufficient food, enough for a good period of house.
一起留下的还有厨师，吃饭彻底不用愁了。
Along with the cook, there is no need to worry about eating.

今年王粒丁是 1 月 22 日来的，在武汉转车顺便找我喝酒。
Wang Gudin came on January 22 this year. He changed his train to find me drinking in Wuhan.
隔天酒醒，才看到了封城的消息。
Wake up the next day, only to see the news of the closure.
我和他是 18 年底在赞斯卡认识，王粒丁在那骑车，我和朋友徒步。
He and I met at the end of the 18th year in Zanska, where Wang Jidin rode, and my friends and I hiked.
在一家小餐馆里碰到，我说这竟然还有中国人，那个地方是争议地区连人都很少见。
In a small restaurant, I said that there are Chinese people, that is the disputed area is rare even people.
闲着聊天，我说我是做啤酒的。
Chatting, I said I made beer.
他说跳东湖吗？我说我靠。
Did he say East Lake? I said fuck me.
那款精酿正是我们打出名头的酒。
That vintage is exactly what we make it out of.
分开前，他说哪天要来酒馆里喝一杯，没想到一来就走不了了。
Before he left, he said he would come to the pub for a drink one day, but he couldn't leave.
我俩颓了三四天，觉得这样不行。
We had been three or four days old, and thought it impossible.
我本就是个在家呆不住的人，与其惶惶度日，不如去做点什么。
I'm just a person who can't stay at home. I'd rather do something than live in a panic.
换了辆能跑好远的电动车，我和王粒丁一起，拿起了相机拍摄一下此时此刻的武汉。
In exchange for an electric car that can run far away, I picked up a camera with Wang Gelatin to take a picture of Wuhan at this moment.
我发小在武汉市肺科医院的 CT 室工作，我俩想着能拍点一线医护的故事，就商量去找他聊聊。
I was working in the CT room of Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, and as we were thinking of taking a first-line medical story, we talked about talking to him.
刚到医院，没说两句，发小就招呼我俩先拍个片子（肺部 CT），“来都来了。
Just arrived at the hospital, did not say a word, hair small beckon us to take a first picture (lung CT), "Come here.
”结果证明我们很健康，他指着黑白 CT 图上我的肺，说它们粉嫩粉嫩的。
We turned out to be healthy, he pointed to my lungs on the black-and-white CT image and said they were pink and tender.
但我和王粒丁自己的拍片却不顺利，医院的规矩，不能采访更不能录影。
But Wang Gelding and I own film is not smooth, hospital rules, can not interview nor video.
我俩骑着电动车，绕着武汉转。
We rode electric cars around Wuhan.
封城的前两天，街上好像只有两类人，不得不出来工作的人，和“神经病”。
For the first two days of the city, there seemed to be only two kinds of people on the streets, people who had to work, and "neurosis."
我们在江汉路碰到一个人三次，他骑着摩拜在宽阔的马路上，一边大笑一边唱着歌。
We met a man three times on Jianghan Road. He was riding Mobai out on the wide street, laughing and singing.
我们骑着车跟他并排，他说着方言，一点也听不懂。
We rode next to him, speaking in a dialect he did not understand.
那种快乐和兴奋好像是人们都躲在家里了，整个城市只属于他。
The joy and excitement seemed to be that people were hiding at home, and the city belonged only to him.
我总觉得武汉人比其他城市的人要“大条”，也市井一些。
I always think that Wuhan than other cities than the "big article," but also some market.
在空的楼宇间，我们听到喇叭放出的音乐，寻过去看到一位环卫阿姨在路边跳舞。
In the empty building, we heard music from the loudspeaker, looking over to see a sanitation aunt dancing by the road.
她不想我们拍到她没在干活，担心丢了饭碗。
She didn't want us to take pictures of her not working for fear of losing her job.
“平常春节热闹，我们都没有休息的时候，现在连出来扔垃圾的人都没有，我想闲着就锻炼一下。
"Usually Spring Festival is busy, we do not rest time, now even out to throw garbage people do not, I want to do some exercise.
” 我觉得有趣，跟她解释我们只是拍着玩，她说行，我们就把车停在一边，跟环卫阿姨还有一个附近的街坊跳了一会。
"I found it interesting to explain to her that we were just playing, and she said yes, and we parked the car and danced with Aunt Sanitary and a neighborhood nearby.
后来我们又碰到了很多环卫工人，他们出于生计仍在为城市的运作担当着协调者的角色。
Later we met many sanitation workers who, out of necessity, continued to play the role of coordinator of the city's operations.
广场舞领军者——光头和临时的舞搭子｜图源见水印街上开门的大多是那些往日里生意不佳的店铺。
Piazza dancers, bareheaded and impromptu, see watermarked streets, where most of the shops that used to do poorly are open.
一家老字号热干面店所在的街区被修成过江隧道后，生意差了不少。
After an old hot-and-dry-noodle shop block was turned into a river tunnel, business got worse.
这家二十年的老店，自开业就没关过门，24 小时营业，现在也还开着。
The 20-year-old store, open 24 hours a day since it opened, is still open.
往年酒馆春节营业的时候，一帮人晚上常去吃宵夜。
Usually when Spring Festival is open in pubs, a group of people often go to have supper at night.
老板娘，我们喊她大姐，就在门口叼着烟，偶尔炸点小吃，自己吃也卖。
Madam, we call her elder sister, just in the doorway with a cigarette, occasionally fried snacks, eat and sell.
王粒丁很好奇它为什么不关门。
Wang Quentin wondered why he did not close the door.
对方很“撩撇”（武汉方言，干脆）地说：“我们这家店就没门。
"The other side very" the skimming "(Wuhan dialect, simply) said:" We have no access to this shop.
”店里的工人指给王粒丁看，门口就只有一个门框。
The workman pointed out to Wang that there was only one doorpost.
硬核的热干面店｜图源见水印我们边拍边吃点。
Hard-core hot-dry noodle shop, see watermark, we eat some while clapping.
拍到烧烤店的时候，我们自己搬了几个小板凳拼成桌子坐着吃。
When we photographed the barbecue shop, we ourselves moved a few small benches and sat down to eat.
原本疫情期间，餐饮业规定只许外带，可打包的烧烤怎么能好吃。
Originally the epidemic period, the catering industry regulations only allow take-out, can be packaged barbecue how can delicious.
隔了两三米，我们揭了口罩，洗干净手，想着赶紧吃完赶紧走。
Two or three meters apart, we took off the mask, wash hands, think of eating quickly left.
就着乌苏，在清冷的街上，恍惚间我觉得这场疫情跟我一点关系都没有。
Just in the cold street, on the street, vaguely conscious, I don't think this epidemic has anything to do with me.
在做好卫生的前提下就餐，拒绝人心惶惶｜图源见水印封城后的第一个晴天，我们骑车经过江汉桥，往下望，每隔十米就有个人在晒太阳。
Eat under the premise of good hygiene, refuse the watermark on the first sunny day after the watermark was sealed, we bicycled across the Jiang Han Bridge, looking down, and every ten meters someone was sunning himself.
东湖边钓鱼的老头，戴着口罩，跟左右的人隔了五米远，特别像网上说的 “北欧式排队法”。
The old man fishing by the East Lake, wearing a mask, was five meters away from the people on the left and right, especially the Nordic Queuing System.
过两天再路过的时候，已经一个人都看不见了，气氛越来越紧张。
By the time we passed two days later, no one could see, and the atmosphere was getting more and more tense.
我一朋友是开花店的，过年前囤了好些花，封城后，被退订也没空去打理，就叫我陪她去花房看看。
A friend of mine is a flowering shop, hoarding a lot of flowers, after the closure of the city, was not free to take care of, asked me to accompany her to see the flower room.
好多花都臭了，一进门就闻到刺鼻的气味。
A lot of the flowers stink. I smell the pungent smell when I enter the door.
她把那些还好着的花包起来给我带走，现在家里摆满了鲜花，还有一些特别贵的，我醒来的时候觉得特别幸福。
She wrapped up all the nice flowers and took them away for me. Now the house is full of flowers and some very expensive ones. I woke up feeling very happy.
王粒丁成了我家的沙发客，他住的小区封锁之后，就搬了过来，我俩一起过日子。
Wang Gu Ding became my family sofa guest, he lived in the block after the block, moved in, we live together.
早几天，我们想着法子，趁着隔壁私人影院的老板来店里做卫生的时候，拜托他给我们多开了几个小时。
A few days earlier, we tried to take advantage of the owner of the private cinema next door to do the cleaning, please he gave us a few more hours.
我们悄摸地看了两场电影，《爱尔兰人》和《寄生虫》，这种感觉就像是坐牢的人吃到了炸圆子（肉丸）。
We quietly watched two films, Irishman and Parasite, and it felt like someone in jail got a fried dumpling.
在可控的范围内，我们想尽量拓宽自己的半径，或许下次有机会能找个私人理发师到家里剪个头。
Within control, we want to widen our radius as much as we can, perhaps next time we can get a personal barber to cut our hair.
左边的是光头，他搂着的就是王粒丁｜图源自18号酒馆都说餐饮业是受疫情影响最大的行业，我觉得没有那么悲观。
On the left is the bald head, with Wang Gentian in his arms. + 12 + I don't think so pessimistic, as the restaurant industry is the one most affected by the epidemic.
长远看，人生中的一两个月不会把人打垮，就算是半年，它也不至于把你变成什么样子，哪怕什么都没有了，你只要有能力，还能活下去，我反正没见过人被饿死的。
In the long run, a month or two in life will not bring you down, not even half a year, and it will not make you what you are, even if there is nothing left.
我们的品牌属于行业里比较头部的几家，如果连我们都没有了，可能这个行业都没了，那也不是我该担心的事。
Our brand belongs to the head of the industry, if we do not even have, perhaps the industry is gone, that is not what I should worry about.
保护好员工和身边的家人朋友，比起经济财富，生命才更重要。
Protecting your employees and your family and friends is more important than financial wealth.
头几天看到头几天看到一些品牌讲述生存维艰的新闻，还有老板手撕员工降薪信的视频，我挺不理解的。
I don't understand the first few days of seeing some brands tell hard-to-live stories, and the video of a boss tearing down an employee's pay letter.
现在最紧要的是受灾的家庭，一线的医护工作者，我们这些中小企业打肿脸充胖子去帮助更需要帮助的人，之后我们变成了更需要帮助的人时，会有人反哺我们。
What matters most now are affected families, front-line health-care workers, our small and medium-sized enterprises to help the more needy, and then when we become the more needy, there will be people who feed us.
我一直相信这个理。
I've always believed in that.
有的外卖小哥说，他接到好多海外的订单送到医院去，我 CT 室工作的发小说，他们收到的牛奶能喝好一阵子。
Some take-out brothers said he received orders from overseas to go to the hospital, my CT room to work on the novel, they can receive milk for a long time.
我想也送点东西去，但我们最多的是酒，总感觉不太像样。
I'd like to send something, too, but most of us are wine, and it doesn't always feel good.
在医院门口等订单的外卖小哥｜图源见水印我和王粒丁的片子发在酒馆的公众号上，我把这些也都写上了，就有一哥们留言说：“我以后再也不买你们酒了，太主流想法了，一点都不摇滚。
Wait for your order at the hospital. See the watermark, Wang Gelding and I wrote it all down on the public tag, and one of my friends wrote, "I'll never buy you any more.
”我就想 “我操你妈逼”，这句话摇不摇滚。
I thought, "Fuck you, fuck you," and I didn't rock 'n' roll.
我还是相信这个世界是爱组成的，如果这个事情不发生在你身上的话，它只是你生命中一个故事。
I still believe that the world is made of love, and if it doesn't happen to you, it's just a story in your life.
很多年以后，可能我只记得，我们在疫情期间拍了一部小片，跟一个朋友一块住了十几天，那段时间生意不太好，还有人们努力地守望和相助。
Years later, maybe all I remember is that we made a little movie during the outbreak, lived with a friend for ten days, had a bad time, and people were trying to be watchful and helpful.
武汉人喜欢叫人“师傅”，这是一个涵盖各行各业，不论性别的称呼。
Wuhan people like to call people "master," which is a name that covers all walks of life, regardless of sex.
疫情期间，接送医护人员的志愿者、 捐赠 20 万物资给医护人员送饭的餐饮店老板、流转在街头的环卫工人，他们通通被称为 “师傅”。
During the outbreak, the volunteers who transported the medical staff, donated 200,000 materials to the owners of the catering establishments where the doctors and nurses delivered food, and the sanitation workers on the streets, all of whom were known as "teachers."
这是一句温暖的称号。
This is a warm title.
我希望这个城市的名片还能 “敞亮”，它的命运不会像那些在市场蒙尘的速食热干面那样。
I hope the name card of this city can still be "bright", its fate will not be like those in the market dust fast-food hot and dry noodles.
每天都有一些不好的信息冲击着我们，不知道疫情何时才能出现拐点，也不知道什么时候才能正式开工。
Every day there are some bad information impact on us, do not know when the outbreak of the inflection point, and do not know when the formal start.
拍片跟大家接触的过程中少了一些焦虑，多了一些希望。
There is less anxiety and more hope in the process of making contact with everyone.
总之，希望在疫情结束之后，能够喝一场大的。
In short, it is hoped that after the outbreak, can drink a big.
