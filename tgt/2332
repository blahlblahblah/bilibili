当晚，有一则旧闻在网络传播：在2019年10月18日-27日于武汉召开的军运会期间，前后有五名外籍运动员因身患输入性传染病，在比赛期间被送往了武汉市金银潭医院。

而从新冠肺炎疫情暴发至今，关于病毒源头与“零号病人”的追溯，出现了华南海鲜市场贩售野生动物、中国科学院武汉病毒研究所病毒泄漏、境外人员输入性传染等多个玄乎其玄的版本。
From the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia to the present, about the source of the virus and "patient zero" retrospective, there are South China seafood market to sell wild animals, Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences virus leakage, people imported from abroad to sexually transmitted versions.
