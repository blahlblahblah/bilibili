From offline to online, from the outbreak period to routine medical treatment, Tianjin "micro-medicine model" may become a model for reference around the world.
全文5588字，阅读约需11分钟从大年初一开始，天津医院感染免疫科副主任刘秀婵有了两个新身份。
From the beginning of New Year's Day, Liu Xiu-chan, deputy director of Infection Immunology at Tianjin Hospital, has two new identities.
穿上防护服戴上口罩，她是支援天津医院发热门诊的临床医生;脱下防护服拿起手机，她是天津微医互联网医院“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”的一名线上医生。
Wear protective clothing and a mask. She is a clinician supporting a fever clinic at Tianjin Hospital. She takes off her protective clothing and picks up her mobile phone.
除夕夜，在天津市卫健委、医保局和市委网信办的统筹指挥下，天津微医互联网医院火速上线。
On New Year's Eve, under the overall command of Tianjin Health Care Commission, Medical Insurance Bureau and Municipal Government Office, Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital rushed to the line.
像刘秀婵一样，全国通过微医互联网医院参与线上“抗疫”的医生，截至2月18日，已经有37277名，累计提供医疗咨询服务136.64万人次。
Like Liu Xiu-chan, doctors throughout the country who take part in the online fight against SARS through the Internet Hospital for Micromedicine have provided 136,640 medical consultation services to 37,277 people as of February 18.

除针对新冠肺炎的免费义诊之外，围绕慢性病和常见病的便民门诊、心理援助专区和医护人员心理关怀通道也快速开通，天津微医互联网医院率先成为天津抗击疫情的“第二战场”。
In addition to free medical treatment for pneumonia, convenient outpatient clinics, psychological assistance areas and psychological care channels for medical personnel around chronic and common diseases were opened rapidly. Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital became the first "second battlefield" for fighting the epidemic in Tianjin.
不久前，国家卫健委印发通知，要求各地在疫情防控工作中充分利用“互联网+医疗”的优势，推动互联网诊疗咨询服务在疫情防控中发挥更为重要的作用，让人民群众获得及时的健康评估和专业指导，精准指导患者有序就诊，有效缓解医院救治压力，减少人员集聚，降低交叉感染风险。
Not long ago, the State Health Council issued a circular requesting all localities to make full use of the advantages of "Internet + medical care" in disease prevention and control efforts, promote the role of Internet consultation services in disease prevention and control, provide timely health assessment and professional guidance to the public, guide patients in an orderly manner, effectively relieve the pressure on hospitals, reduce the concentration of personnel and reduce the risk of cross-infection.
从线下到线上，从疫情时期到常规医疗，天津“微医模式”或将成为各地参考借鉴的范例。
From offline to online, from the outbreak period to routine medical treatment, Tianjin "micro-medicine model" may become a model for reference around the world.
━━━━━医生“上线”刘秀婵是1月25日进入医院发热门诊工作的。
Dr. Liu Xiu-chan is a doctor who enters the hospital on January 25 to work in a fever clinic.
“1月中旬，医院就开始在全院范围内给医护人员做关于传染病接诊和收治的相关培训，所以当时大家都已经紧张起来，随时准备着。
"In mid-January, the hospital began to train hospital staff on the treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, so people were already nervous and ready.
”刘秀婵说，随着发热门诊人数越来越多，需要大批医生支援，她也第一时间前往发热门诊。
Liu Xiu-chan said she first went to the fever clinic as more and more people were coming to the clinic and needed a lot of doctors' support.
也是在同一天，刘秀婵接到天津微医互联网医院的电话，希望她能参与“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”的在线问诊。
On the same day, Liu Xiu-chan received a call from Tianjin Micromedical Internet Hospital, hoping that she could participate in the online consultation on the New Crown Pneumonia Real-Time Rescue Platform.
“发热门诊早中晚班交替，一进去就得连续工作7个小时，有时候还得上10个小时，防护服都不能脱。
"Heat clinics alternate between morning and night shifts, working seven hours a day, sometimes up to 10 hours at a time, without being stripped of protective clothing.
”刘秀婵也想过，自己能忙得过来吗?但她很快就说服了自己，决定在线上为有需要的人提供免费咨询。
Liu Xiu-chan thought, Can she be busy? But she soon convinced herself that free consultation is available online for those in need.
“我本身是免疫专业的，对疫情的相关情况也比较了解了，能够通过互联网为更多人提供咨询，让他们少跑医院，避免交叉感染的风险，我觉得是一件很好的事情。
"I am an immunologist and have a better understanding of the epidemic, and I think it's a good thing to be able to provide more people with advice via the Internet, to keep them out of hospitals and to avoid the risk of cross-infection," he said.
”入驻“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”提供在线咨询的，还有菊梅消化中心病区主任、解放军总医院第五医学中心中西医结合科原主治医生杨慧银。
Yang Huiyin, director of the Ju Mei Digestive Center and chief physician of the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine at the 5th Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital.
2003年亲临“非典”一线的经历，让杨慧银很早就对疫情有更高的警惕。
"SARS" first line of experience in 2003, let Yang Huiyin very early on the epidemic has a higher level of vigilance.
“当时我的工作单位是原解放军第302医院，它是全军唯一的一家三甲传染病专科医院，我们离‘非典’很近，管理非常严格正规，因此对传染病和隔离的知识也有更多的了解，会格外注意一些。
"I was working at the 302 Hospital of the former PLA. It was the only special hospital for triple A infectious diseases in the PLA. We were very close to SARS and very strictly regulated, so we knew a lot more about infectious diseases and quarantine.
”忙完每天的日常工作，杨慧银会将大部分精力投入到线上。
With her day-to-day routine, Ms. Yang devotes most of her energy to working online.
“晚上12点之前都会随时在平台上接诊。
"I'll be on the platform any time before 12: 00 pm.
”在杨慧银看来，这也是她参与到“抗疫”医疗战线中的一种方式。
In Yang's view, it was also a way for her to participate in the battle against the disease on the medical front.
“没有办法到一线去做贡献，在后方力所能及地尽一份力量，内心也觉得非常激动和荣幸。
"There is no way to make a contribution to the front, in the rear as much as possible to do their part, also feel very excited and honored.
”━━━━━另一种“抗疫”跟刘秀婵和杨慧银一样的医生还有很多，截至2月18日，通过天津微医互联网医院参与线上“抗疫”的医生已经有37277名。
Dr. Liu Xiu-chan and Yang Huiyin have many more doctors, and as of February 18, there were 37,277 doctors taking part in the online battle against SARS through the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital.
天津微医互联网医院在除夕夜火速上线。
Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital on New Year's Eve rushed to the line.
彼时，新冠肺炎疫情正在全国范围内蔓延，各地医院发热门诊就诊人数激增，一线医护全面进入“备战”状态。
At that time, the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic was spreading across the country, hospitals fever clinic attendance surged, the first-line health care into "war preparations."
为减少民众就医交叉感染风险，助力疫情风险防控，天津市卫健委联合天津微医互联网医院在全市开展互联网医院线上义诊行动，鼓励全市医师利用业余时间为天津和全国群众提供不限次、全免费健康问诊咨询服务。
In order to reduce the risk of cross-infection and help prevent and control the epidemic, Tianjin Health Center, in conjunction with Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital, launched an on-line medical consultation service in the city, encouraging doctors throughout the city to use their spare time to provide unlimited and free medical consultation to the people of Tianjin and the whole country.
截至2月13日24时，“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”发现新冠肺炎可疑病例1354例，并在医患合作下，将可疑病例向各地疾控部门上报。
As of 2400 hours February 13, the New Crown Pneumonia Real-Time Rescue Platform found 1,354 suspected cases of new crown pneumonia, and with the cooperation of doctors and patients, reported suspicious cases to local disease control departments.
微医互联网总医院相关负责人张颂奇介绍，通过“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”，用户可以在线免费咨询专家、进行心理健康咨询;领取《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防治知识问答》，掌握专业科普知识;利用便民门诊线上开药，享受送药到家服务;同时可以关注天津地区疫情动态，掌握最新疫情信息。

At present, free platform consultation and convenient clinic are available nationwide, and "patients can enter the New Crown Pneumonia real-time rescue platform or enter the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital. After registering on the hospital, they can choose their own picture and text consultation, video consultation, telephone consultation and a pre-clinical questionnaire to describe their condition.
”张颂奇说，为保证医生全面了解情况，患者还可以选择上传就诊病历、影像报告、检查检验报告，与医生在线沟通。
To ensure doctors are fully aware of the situation, patients can also choose to upload medical records, image reports, inspection reports and communicate online with doctors, Zhang said.
天津微医互联网医院甫一上线，来自当地和全国各地、尤其是武汉地区的问诊需求大量涌入，每分钟问诊量达五六十人次。
As soon as Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital went online, there was a huge influx of requests from local and national places, especially Wuhan, where the number of consultations per minute reached 50 to 60.
2月13日，杨慧银就接到了一位来自湖北地区的患者求助。
On February 13, Yang Huiyin received a call for help from a patient in Hubei province.
“这是一位对自己对他人都比较负责的患者。
"This is a patient who is more responsible for himself and others.
他是在出现感冒症状后，及时去医院做了排查，血常规和CT影像都显示正常，也没有提示新冠肺炎的可能。
He went to the hospital for a scan in time after he developed symptoms of a cold. Both routine and CT images showed signs of normality, and there was no suggestion of a new crown pneumonia.
但患者本人非常焦虑，感觉有被传染的风险。
But the patient himself is very anxious and feels at risk of infection.
”通过详细的图文聊天和电话沟通后，杨慧银告诉这位患者，平常心对待，同时做好隔离。
"Yang told the patient to treat her well and isolate her through detailed text and photo chats and telephone conversations.
杨慧银说，类似这样因为怀疑自己感染而前来咨询的人不在少数，“这种情况下，感觉自己实际上是在为对方进行心理疏导。
Yang said many such people came to the consultation because they suspected they were infected. "In this case, they felt they were actually conducting psychological counseling for each other.

Wan Nan-sheng, chief respiratory doctor at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, is on-line for medical consultation.
━━━━━疫情时期的心理关怀为应对疫情造成的普遍心理创伤，“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”特别开设心理援助专区。
---- Psychosocial Care in an Epidemic Period To cope with the widespread psychological trauma caused by the outbreak, the New Crown Pneumonia Real-Time Rescue Platform has set up special psychological assistance areas.
天津微医互联网医院联合中国灾害防御协会社会心理服务专业委员会、中国心理卫生协会心理治疗与咨询专业委员会及志愿者团队，在心理援助专区面向所有网友提供自测预判、咨询专家等心理服务。
Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital, in collaboration with the Special Committee on Social and Psychological Services of the China Disaster Defense Association, the Specialist Committee on Psychotherapy and Counseling of the Chinese Mental Health Association and a volunteer team, provide psychological services such as self-assessment and consultation specialists to all netizens in psychological assistance areas.
针对疫区最为常见的创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)、焦虑、抑郁，网友可通过7至17题的自测提问，完成初步评估，自测会根据评估结果推荐是否需要进一步咨询心理专家。
For the most common post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression in epidemic areas, netizens can ask self-test questions from 7 to 17 questions, complete preliminary assessment, and self-test will recommend whether further consultation with psychological experts is needed.
据悉，第一批上线的百名心理专家团队，主要由精神科医生、心理咨询师组成，其中超过20%为临床医生。
It is reported that the first batch of 100 psychological experts, mainly by psychiatrists, psychologists, more than 20% of clinical doctors.
温州康宁医院副院长、临床心理科主任叶敏捷和他的同事们，每天要接到20至40个寻求心理援助的热线电话，“大多数是因为担心被感染而焦虑的普通人，也有因为不适应隔离而恐慌不安的。
Ye Agile, vice-president of Wenzhou Conning Hospital and director of clinical psychology, and his colleagues receive 20 to 40 calls a day seeking psychological help. "Most of them are from ordinary people who are worried about getting infected, and others who are scared and apprehensive about not being able to adapt to isolation
”为减轻民众的心理恐慌，引导民众正确认识疫情、科学防治，1月27日，天津市委网信办联合微医互联网总医院、天津微医互联网医院推出的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防治知识手册》在“新冠肺炎实时救助平台”上线，供公众免费领取。
"To ease people's psychological panic and guide them to correctly understand the epidemic and prevent and cure it, on January 27, the" Knowledge Manual on the Prevention and Treatment of Pneumonia from New Coronavirus Infection, "launched by the Tianjin Municipal General Hospital for Micromedicine and the Tianjin Micromedical Internet Hospital, was put on line for free collection by the public.
据天津市委网信办相关负责人介绍，手册从对病原的认识、传播途径、临床表现和相关治疗、防控常识、认识误区等几个方面，以图文形式第一时间传播科学防疫知识。
According to the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Office of the relevant responsible person, the manual from the pathogen awareness, transmission, clinical manifestations and related treatment, common sense, misunderstanding, and other aspects of control, dissemination of scientific epidemic prevention knowledge in graphic and text form.
截至2月19日19点，手册已累计下载51.9万份。
As at 1900 hours on 19 February, 519,000 copies of the manual had been downloaded.
随着疫情的蔓延，民众也在寻求对工作、生活等不同场景中具体防治措施的权威释疑。
As the epidemic spreads, people are also seeking to assert their authority over specific prevention and treatment measures in different settings, such as work and life.
1月29日，天津市委网信办联合微医互联网总医院、中国中医药出版社共同编写的《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎防治知识问答》也随即上线，以问答的形式对疫情的焦点话题进行了专业、通俗的阐释。
On January 29, Tianjin Municipal Government Online Letter Office and China Traditional Chinese Medicine Publishing House jointly prepared the "New Coronavirus Infection of Pneumonia Knowledge" was immediately put on the line, giving a professional and popular explanation on the focus of the epidemic in the form of questions and answers.
“《问答》附录里还汇集了国家卫生健康委发布的有关新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎的诊疗方案以及防控文件，同时推出中英文版图书，这是全球首部关于新毒肺炎防治的中英文对照出版物。
"The Q & A Appendix also contains a compilation of the NCHC's diagnosis and treatment plan for pneumonia due to new coronavirus infection, as well as a document on the prevention and control of coronavirus infection.
”相关负责人说。
'said the person in charge.
除了对普通公众的心理关怀，天津微医互联网医院也特别开通了医护人员心理关怀专属通道。
In addition to the general public psychological care, Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital also opened a special psychological care channel for medical staff.
有一位奋战在疫情一线的医生给叶敏捷打来电话，诉说他的自责与无力。
A doctor on the frontline of the epidemic called Ye quickly to tell him of his remorse and powerlessness.
“他是一位医术非常高明的医生，一开始他对救治病人很有信心。
"He was a very skillful doctor, and at first he was very confident in treating his patients.
但面对新型冠状病毒这个新敌人，他变得束手无策。
But he became helpless in the face of a new coronavirus, the new enemy.
他觉得，自己是一个专业的医生，为什么原来觉得很有把握的事情忽然之间变得毫无控制能力，甚至因此产生无价值感。
He felt that he was a professional doctor, why something he had felt so sure of suddenly became uncontrollable and even worthless.
”叶敏捷说，疫情当前，一线医护人员面临着比常人更加巨大的压力，“他们不仅要去救助病人，也要小心自身防护，还要担心家人安全。
With the epidemic under way, front-line health-care workers are under greater pressure than usual not only to save patients, but also to be careful about their own protection and the safety of their families, he said.
疫情的冲击、长时间隔离的状态、不稳定的医患关系，集中爆发的时候，会造成极大的心理危机。
The impact of the epidemic, isolation for a long time, unstable doctor-patient relationship, concentrated outbreak, will cause a great psychological crisis.
”在叶敏捷看来，线上心理援助的好处是，不会让求助者产生羞耻感或者不安，“医生是一个不太愿意示弱和求助的群体，所以我们首先还是提供一个心理状态的自评工具，让他们自己判断一下焦虑的程度、情绪的不稳定性，如果是明显需要心理援助的，再拨打心理援助热线。
In Ye's view, the advantage of online psychological aid is that it does not cause shame or uneasiness to the sufferer. "Doctors are a reluctant group to offer weakness and help, so first we provide a psychological self-assessment tool that lets them judge for themselves how anxious they are, how emotionally unstable they are, and then call a psychological helpline if they are clearly in need of it.
”倾听和回应求助者的情绪，是心理援助的基本工作。
Listening to and responding to the feelings of the requester are the basic tasks of psychological assistance.
叶敏捷说，为医护人员开通的这个求助热线，就是专门提供给他们表达情绪的。
Ye said that this help line for medical staff is specially designed to express their emotions.
此外，心理援助团队也会帮助医护人员处理自身的一些认知行为，教他们通过放松身体来缓解心理压力，并鼓励他们与外界保持联系。
Psychological assistance teams also help doctors and nurses deal with some of their cognitive behaviors, teach them to relieve psychological stress by relaxing their bodies, and encourage them to keep in touch with the outside world.
━━━━━不忘慢性病患者受突如其来的疫情困扰的，还有许多慢性病患者。
--George Bernard Shaw Remember that chronically ill people are afflicted by sudden outbreaks of disease, and that there are many chronically ill people.
受疫情影响，一些医院的普通门诊暂停，也有患者因感染风险不敢前往医院。
As a result of the outbreak, general clinics were suspended in some hospitals and patients were afraid to travel to hospitals because of the risk of infection.
如何复诊、续药，成为慢性病患者群不得不面对的一大难题。
How to reexamine and renew the medicine has become a difficult problem that the chronic disease patients have to face.
“以乙肝为例，我国的乙肝患者人群非常庞大，有将近7000万人的病例。
"Taking hepatitis B as an example, the population of hepatitis B patients in China is very large, with nearly 70 million cases.
对于乙肝病人来说，抗病毒治疗是一个基础治疗，抗病毒药物又不能停，非常时期这就成为一件很矛盾的事情。
For hepatitis B patients, antiviral treatment is a basic treatment, antiviral drugs can not stop, this is a very contradictory thing.
”杨慧银说。
"said Yang.
为应对慢性病复诊患者就医和用药需求，天津要求全市全科医师登录天津微医互联网医院，依法开展慢性病、常见病复诊服务。
In order to meet the needs of patients with chronic diseases, Tianjin requires general practitioners to register with the Tianjin Micromedical Internet Hospital to carry out the services of chronic and common diseases.
2月7日，天津微医互联网医院在免费向患者提供网上咨询问诊服务的基础上，开通线上便民门诊，重点围绕常见病和慢性病，为市民提供在线复诊、在线开方、药品配送一站式服务。
On 7 February, the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital opened an online consultation service to patients free of charge, focusing on common and chronic diseases, providing online revisits, online prescriptions and one-stop drug distribution services.
便民门诊一开通，天津市武清区中医医院内分泌科主治医师张传英的“线上”病人就多了起来。
The opening of a convenient outpatient clinic, Tianjin Wuqing District Chinese Medicine Hospital endocrinology department chief doctor Zhang Chuanying "on-line" patients more.
“对于病情比较平稳的慢性病患者来说，线上复诊开药与线下没有太多区别，而且还不用排长队，目前疫情时期，也避免了交叉感染的风险。
"For people with more stable chronic conditions, online revisits are not much different from offline medications and do not require long queues, and the risk of cross-infection is now avoided.
”张传英说。
"said Zhang.
据她介绍，患者在线上复诊、开药的流程也不复杂。
According to her, patients on-line revisits, prescription procedures are not complicated.
天津市民通过电脑或手机进入“天津微医互联网医院”微信公众号，点击天津微医互联网医院的“去开药”，选择相关科室，上传、填写病历及用药需求后，就可以等待医生接诊。
Tianjin residents through the computer or mobile phone into the "Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital" Weixin public number, click on Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital "to open medicine," select the relevant departments, upload, fill in medical records and drug demand, can wait for doctor to receive treatment.
“以糖尿病为例，我们会询问患者有几年病史，在用什么药，肝肾功能怎么样，是否有过敏史，目前血糖控制得好不好。
"In the case of diabetes, we ask about the patient's history, what kind of medication he or she is taking, how he or she functions, whether he or she has allergies, and how well blood sugar is being controlled.
有的病人可能在线下就诊过，也可以上传诊断单和处方，供医生参考。
Some patients may have gone online to see a doctor, but can also upload diagnostic lists and prescriptions for doctors to refer to.
”张传英说，通过这些问诊，基本能够了解病人当下的病情，判断是否需要调整用药，并开具处方。
"Through these consultations, patients can basically understand their current condition, determine whether they need to adjust their medication and make prescriptions," Zhang said.
处方审核通过，患者可直接下单购药，支付成功后药品会于当日或次日快递配送到家。
Prescription approval, patients can directly order the purchase of drugs, pay for the success of the day or the next express delivery home.
但张传英也提醒，慢性病患者依然需要定期到线下门诊进行复查。
But Zhang also warned that patients with chronic diseases still need regular on-line out-patient visits.
例如糖尿病患者需要定期复查肝肾功能、糖化血红蛋白、尿蛋白;有视网膜病变的需要定期复查眼底等。
For example, diabetic patients need to regularly review the liver and kidney function, glycosylated hemoglobin, urinary protein; retinopathy requires regular review of the ocular fundus.
▲天津市民使用天津微医互联网医院便民门诊开药，第二天药品就送到了家中。
Tianjin residents use Tianjin micro-medicine Internet hospital to open out-patient medicine, the next day the drugs were delivered home.
对于天津市民来说，一个更大的利好是，目前，天津市医保局等相关部门正在与天津微医互联网医院依托的实体医院进行对接。
For Tianjin residents, a greater positive is that, at present, Tianjin Health Insurance Bureau and other relevant departments are relying on the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital physical hospital docking.
未来，慢性病和常见病患者在线上开药，或将与线下同步使用医保报销。
In the future, patients with chronic and common diseases will be prescribed drugs online or will be reimbursed using health insurance in sync with offline use.
随着疫情的蔓延，各地防控措施加强，慢性病患者用药难的问题越来越凸显。
With the spread of the epidemic, local prevention and control measures have been strengthened, chronic disease patients more and more difficult problems.
一位身在武汉的肝病患者也发来求助。
A liver disease patient in Wuhan also sent for help.
“一般情况下我们要求病人3到6个月来复查一次，但武汉管控后，他的出行变得非常困难。
"Normally we ask patients to come back three to six months later, but Wuhan has made it very difficult for him to travel.
而且武汉大部分医护人员都前去支援疫情一线，普通门诊暂停，他的特定用药也不是所有医院都有。
And Wuhan most of the medical personnel go to support the epidemic line, general outpatient clinics suspended, his specific medication is not all hospitals.
”杨慧银说，这导致病人开药、购药都成了问题。
That has led patients to prescribe drugs and to buy them, Ms. Yang said.
其介绍，按照线下医院的标准和流程，菊梅医生团队在微医互联网医院上打通了线上复诊和处方流转环节，并协调好物流渠道，成功将药给患者送到了家里。
In accordance with the standards and procedures of the off-line hospital, the team opened the online referral and prescription process at the micromedical Internet hospital and coordinated the logistics channel, successfully delivering the medicine to the patient at home.
━━━━━让互联网医院走向日常▲患者在使用天津微医互联网医院前，需填写诊前问卷。
---Getting Internet Hospitals to Daily Routine Patients should fill out a pre-exam questionnaire before using the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital.
除了针对新冠肺炎的线上免费咨询、为慢性病和常见病患者开通的便民门诊、特殊时期的心理援助，天津微医互联网医院还专门启动了发热门诊候诊情况发布机制。
In addition to free online consultations for new crown pneumonia, open outpatient clinics for chronic and common diseases, and psychological assistance for special periods, the Tianjin Micromedicine Internet Hospital has launched a special waiting list mechanism for fever clinics.
天津及全国疫情动态也设立了专门的页面实时更新。
Tianjin and the national epidemic situation also set up a dedicated page real-time update.
“发热门诊候诊情况每2小时通过媒体向公众发布，目的是为了引导发热病人合理选择就医机构，避免出现发热病人集中就诊情况。
"The waiting lists for fever clinics are distributed to the public every two hours through the media, with the aim of guiding patients with fever to make rational choice of medical treatment facilities and to avoid concentrated visits by fever patients.
”据相关负责人介绍，这一发布机制是依托天津市卫生健康专网，采取数据自动抓取方式，实现医疗机构发热门诊候诊情况实时采集、自动汇总。
According to the person in charge, the release mechanism is based on the Tianjin health network, which uses automatic data fetching to collect and automatically aggregate the waiting lists for medical facilities' calorific clinics.
其表示，目前正在不断完善信息采集分析和监测预警功能，力争为决策研判提供更加科学、及时的依据。
It said that the information collection, analysis and monitoring and early warning functions are constantly being improved to provide a more scientific and timely basis for decision-making.
国家卫健委规划司近日就互联网诊疗咨询服务相关问题召开研讨会时表示，天津等地结合实际积极搭建权威统一的互联网医疗平台，规范提供针对发热、咳嗽等症状的线上诊疗咨询服务，并强化线上线下医疗服务协同联动，可以更好地助力打赢疫情攻坚战，值得各地参考借鉴。
Tianjin and other places should set up an authoritative and unified Internet medical platform to provide online consultation services for fever, cough and other symptoms, and strengthen the coordination of on-line and off-line medical services, so as to better help win the battle against the epidemic.
不少医生也认为，互联网医院不仅仅是特殊时期的有效举措，同样也值得在日常的患者管理中推广。
Many doctors also believe that Internet hospitals are not only a special period of effective measures, but also worth promoting in the daily management of patients.
刘秀婵觉得，通过互联网医院平台，医生可以跟患者，尤其是慢性病患者建立长期的良好沟通，随时询问病情。
Liu Xiu-chan feels that, through the Internet hospital platform, doctors can establish long-term good communication with patients, especially those with chronic diseases.
“比如患者用药以后有哪些临床症状上的变化，或者出现一些不良反应情况，我们可以在线上直接指导他怎么处理。
"For example, if a patient has a change in clinical symptoms after taking the drug, or if there are some adverse reactions, we can direct him online to what to do with it.
如果是轻微的反应，可能让患者自行购买一些药物，就能纠正;但如果是比较严重的情况，就会建议及时来医院治疗。
If the reaction is mild, the patient may be allowed to buy some medicine himself, which can be corrected, but in more serious cases, prompt hospital treatment is recommended.
”“对一些老病人来说，他们更希望跟首诊医生保持长期联系，获得持续的帮助。
"For some older patients, they prefer to keep in touch with their first doctor for a long time and get ongoing help.
”杨慧银说，线上问诊平台就可以提供这样的联系渠道，让病人得到及时的诊治，不用非得跑医院去挂号、去排队，才能看上医生。
Yang said the online consultation platform could provide a way for patients to get timely treatment without having to go to a hospital to register or queue to see a doctor.
同时，能够极大缓解一线的临床压力，让患者减少无序奔波，让真正有需要的患者到医院去就诊。
At the same time, can greatly ease the first line of clinical pressure, so that patients to reduce disorder, so that the real needs of patients to the hospital.
但互联网医院当然不可能完全替代线下实体医院，检查、化验等项目必须在线下完成。
But the Internet hospital certainly cannot completely replace the offline physical hospital, the inspection, the laboratory and so on project must complete on-line.
“有时候我在线上回答患者的问题，会有一种有劲使不上的感觉。
"Sometimes when I answer a patient's question online, I feel like I don't feel like I'm doing it.
”杨慧银也坦言，目前的互联网医院解决了为复诊病人问诊和开药的问题，下一步必须要考虑打通与线下医院的业务协同，推行专科检查检验标准化，实现跨区域检查和复诊问题，“让病人知道应该完成什么频次的复查，去哪里能够完成专业准确的复查，复查结果可以及时回传给首诊医生，医生也能及时查看化验和检测情况，给予患者及时和专业的指导。
Yang also admitted that the current Internet hospital has solved the problem of consultation and prescription of drugs for repeat visits. The next step must be to consider opening up business collaborations with the off-line hospitals, standardizing specialist examinations and revisits, "letting patients know what frequency to complete and where to complete professional and accurate reviews.
”“这是我认为未来互联网医院发展的理想状态，也是对线下实体医院的一个非常好的补充和延展。
"This is the ideal state for the future development of Internet hospitals and a very good complement to and extension of the on-line physical hospitals," he said.
