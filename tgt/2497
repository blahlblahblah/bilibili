澎湃新闻记者 吴怡2月27日，国际顶级医学期刊JAMA在线发表了一篇题为“Positive RT-PCR Test Results in Patients Recovered From COVID-19”的研究论文。
Peng Yi Feb 27, the international top medical journal JAMA online published a research paper entitled "Positive RT-PCR Test Results in Patiently Protected From COVID-19."
该研究发现有4例符合出院或隔离检疫标准的COVID-19（新冠肺炎）患者，在5至13天后经实时逆转录-聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）测试COVID-19核酸为阳性。
Four patients with COVID-19 (New Crown Pneumonia) who met the criteria for discharge or quarantine were found to be positive for COVID-19 nucleic acid after 5-13 days on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
研究结果表明，至少有一部分康复患者仍可能是病毒携带者，可能需重新评估出院标准。
The results suggest that at least some of the convalescent patients may still be carriers of the virus and may need to reassess their discharge criteria.
针对复诊过程中发现有核酸检测阳性的情况，国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红在2月28日国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上表示，“通过监测发现，这部分患者没有再发生传染别人的现象，另外有一部分患者再检测新冠病毒核酸时又转为阴性。
In response to the discovery of positive nucleic acid tests during the reexamination, Guo Yanhong, an inspector of the State Council's Hospital Authority, said at a press conference of the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on February 28.
”她指出，新冠肺炎病毒是一个新病毒，它的致病机理、疾病的全貌和病程的特点还需要进一步加深认识。
She points out that the new Crown Pneumonia virus is a new virus whose pathogenesis, full extent and course need to be better understood.
上述论文的通讯作者为武汉大学中南医院影像科主任、放射科医学博士徐海波和检验科主任、医学博士李一荣。
The author of the thesis is Xu Haibo, Director of Imaging and Doctor of Radiology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University.
研究指出，以前关于2019年冠状病毒疾病（COVID-19）的研究主要集中于确诊感染患者的流行病学、临床和放射学特征上，很少有研究关注康复患者的后续情况。
The study noted that previous studies on the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) focused mainly on the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with infection, with few studies focusing on the follow-up of patients with rehabilitation.
武汉大学中南医院的研究从2020年1月1日至2月15日，在武汉大学中南医院对1例住院患者和3例在家中隔离的COVID-19患者（所有的患者均为医务人员）进行了治疗，并进行了实时逆转录-聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）测试COVID-19核酸，以确定他们是否可以恢复工作。
From January 1 to February 15, 2020, the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University treated one hospitalized patient and three COVID-19 patients (all of whom were medical staff) isolated in their homes, and conducted a real-time antiretroviral-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 nucleic acids to determine whether they could resume work.
出院或隔离检疫必须符合以下所有条件：（1）体温正常持续超过3天，（2）呼吸系统症状得到缓解，（3）胸部CT图像上的急性渗出性病变明显改善，（4）两次连续的RT-PCR测试结果均为阴性，且测试至少间隔1天。
All of the following conditions must be met for discharge or quarantine: (1) normal body temperature for more than 3 days, (2) relief of respiratory symptoms, (3) significant improvement in acute exudative lesions on CT images of the chest, (4) negative results of two consecutive RT-PCR tests with at least one day intervals.
起初，按照先前描述的方法，医疗专业人员对4位患者进行咽拭子RT-PCR测试，这4位患者均被感染2019年新型冠状病毒。
Initially, following the previously described procedure, four patients were tested for pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, and all four were infected with the new coronavirus 2019.
其中两名是男性，年龄范围为30至36岁。
Two of them are men and range in age from 30 to 36.
3名患者均有发烧、咳嗽，或两种症状同时发作。
All 3 patients had fever, cough, or both symptoms.
有一名患者最初无症状，由于接触了感染的患者而进行了薄层CT检查。
One patient, initially asymptomatic, underwent a thin CT examination as a result of exposure to infected patients.
所有患者的RT-PCR检测结果均为阳性，CT影像显示磨玻璃样混浊或混合性磨玻璃影混浊与合并。
Results of RT-PCR were positive in all patients, and CT images showed turbidity and fusion of grinding glass-like opacity or mixed grinding glass.
疾病的严重程度为轻度至中度。
The severity of the disease is mild to moderate.
医院为4名患者提供抗病毒治疗（每12小时口服75mg奥司他韦）。
The hospital provided antiviral treatment to four patients (75 mg oseltamivir every 12 hours).
其中3例患者的所有临床症状和CT影像均已恢复正常。
All clinical symptoms and CT images were restored to normal in 3 patients.
第4例患者的CT影像显示有细微的磨玻璃片样混浊。
CT images of a fourth patient showed a fine glasslike opacity.
所有4例患者连续2次RT-PCR均为阴性，从症状发作到恢复的时间为12至32天。
RT-PCR was negative for 2 consecutive cases in all 4 patients, with 12 to 32 days from onset of symptoms to recovery.
满足符合RT-PCR检测阴性加上临床特征和胸部CT表现正常的出院条件后，上述4位患者得以出院或中止隔离，但被要求在家里继续自行隔离5天。
Satisfied with discharge conditions that met the negative RT-PCR test combined with clinical features and normal chest CT findings, the four patients were discharged from the hospital or suspended isolation, but were required to remain in isolation for up to five days at home.
他们在5至13天后再次进行RT-PCR测试，所有测试结果均为阳性。
They did the RT-PCR test again 5 to 13 days later, and all the tests were positive.
然后，所有患者在接下来的4至5天内进行了3次重复的RT-PCR测试，均为阳性。
All patients were then given three repeated RT-PCR tests over the next four to five days, all of them positive.
另外，医院又使用其他制造商的试剂盒对这些患者进行RT-PCR测试，结果显示均为阳性。
The patients were also tested positive on RT-PCR using kits from other manufacturers.
经临床医生检查，这些患者仍无症状，胸部CT检查结果与以前的图像相比无变化。
The patients remained asymptomatic after a clinician's examination, and the results of the chest CT examination were unchanged from previous images.
患者报告（出院后）没有与任何有呼吸道症状的人接触，也没有家人感染。
Patients reported no contact (after discharge) with anyone with respiratory symptoms and no family infection.
研究发现，这4例符合出院或隔离检疫标准的COVID-19患者（无临床症状和放射学异常，且两次RT-PCR检测结果均为阴性），在5至13天后RT-PCR检测结果为阳性。
The study found that four patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria for discharge or quarantine (no clinical symptoms and radiation abnormalities and negative RT-PCR results on both occasions) tested positive for RT-PCR after 5 to 13 days.
这表明，至少有一部分康复患者仍可能是病毒携带者。
This suggests that at least some of those recovering may still be carriers of the virus.
研究提出，尽管没有家庭成员被感染，但这些报告的患者均为医疗专业人员，并在家庭隔离期间进行了特别护理，可能需要重新评估当前的出院或中止隔离检疫标准以及持续的患者管理。
The study suggests that, although no family members are infected, the reported patients are medical professionals and receive intensive care during family isolation, which may require a reassessment of current discharge or suspension of quarantine standards and ongoing patient management.
论文提及，该研究仅限于少数轻度或中度感染患者。
The study was limited to a small number of people with mild or moderate infections, the paper said.
对于非医疗保健专业人员，出院或中止隔离后感染更为严重的患者，应进行进一步研究。
For non-health care professionals, further research should be carried out on patients with more severe infections following discharge or discontinuation of isolation.
对更多患者的纵向研究将有助于了解该疾病的预后。
Longitudinal studies of more patients will help to understand the prognosis of the disease.
患者出院后为何会出现“复阳”的现象，应该如何应对？在2月27日广州医科大学举办疫情防控专场新闻通气会上，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山表示，复阳可能涉及自身情况、核酸检测等多种因素，检测试剂、检测方法、采样方法都可能对阳性率产生影响。
At a press briefing on the prevention and control of the epidemic at Guangzhou Medical University on Feb. 27, Zhong Nan-shan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of the high-level expert group, said Fuyang may involve its own circumstances, nucleic acid testing and other factors, detection reagents, detection methods and sampling methods may have an impact on the positive rate.
钟南山指出，新冠肺炎是新发传染病，目前不能下绝对的定论。
Zhong Nan Shan pointed out that the new crown pneumonia is a new infectious disease, can not be absolutely conclusive.
一般只要康复患者产生足够的抗体，就不会再次感染。
As long as convalescent patients produce enough antibodies, they do not become infected again.
至于会不会再传染给别人，这还有待观察。
It remains to be seen whether it will infect others again.
如果康复者在家隔离检测到阳性时，24小时后需要再检测，如果两次都是阳性，需要去就医。
If the recovered person tests positive in isolation at home, he or she needs to be retested after 24 hours and, if both times are positive, to see a doctor.
而在2月28日国务院联防联控机制新闻发布会上，国家卫健委医政医管局监察专员郭燕红表示，随着治愈患者不断增多，为及时了解患者出院以后的康复状况，国家卫生健康委在2月17日下发文件，要求各地对出院患者进行跟踪随访和健康管理。
Guo Yanhong, the State Council's medical and health watchdog, said at a press conference on Feb. 28 that as more patients are cured and their recovery status is timely, the NHS issued a document on February 17 asking all localities to follow up and manage the health of patients discharged from hospitals.
在这个过程中，部分省报告治愈出院患者，在复诊过程中发现有核酸检测阳性的情况。
In this process, some provinces reported curing patients discharged from the hospital, in the course of the revisits found to be nucleic acid positive.
国家卫健委组织专家对这个问题进行研究，同时也加强对这部分病例的连续监测。
The State Council for Health Care organizes expert studies on this issue and also strengthens the continuous monitoring of this group of cases.
“通过监测发现，这部分患者没有再发生传染别人的现象，另外有一部分患者再检测新冠病毒核酸时又转为阴性。
"The surveillance found that there was no further transmission to other patients, and that some patients switched back to negative when they were tested for Nucleic Acid," he said.
”郭燕红表示，新冠肺炎病毒是一个新病毒，它的致病机理、疾病的全貌和病程的特点还需要进一步加深认识。
Guo said the virus was a new virus and that its pathogenic mechanism, the full extent of the disease and the nature of the disease needed to be better understood.
郭燕红称，要进一步加强对出院患者的管理，现在要求进行14天的医学观察，并在实施14天医学观察当中加强跟踪随访、健康监测和健康指导，同时组织专家对这种情况进行进一步研究，对疾病的发生、发展、转归的全程进一步加深认识。
Guo said that to further strengthen the management of patients discharged from hospital, now requires 14 days of medical observation, as well as enhanced follow-up, health monitoring and health guidance during the implementation of the 14-day medical observation.
《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》解读亦提及，患者出院后，建议应继续进行14天自我健康状况监测，佩戴口罩，有条件的居住在通风良好的单人房间，减少与家人的近距离密切接触。
The Interpretation of the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme (Trial Version 6) also states that after discharge from hospital, patients are advised to continue monitoring their self-health for 14 days, wear masks, live in well-ventilated single rooms and reduce close contact with their families.
建议在出院后第2周、第4周到医院随访、复诊。
It is suggested that the second week and the fourth week after discharge should be followed up and reexamined.
早前多地也出台公告要求对治愈出院患者进行再隔离观察。
Earlier many also issued a proclamation to cure patients discharged from the hospital for re-isolation observation.
2月22日，武汉市新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部发布公告称，即日起，新冠肺炎治愈出院患者完成医院治疗后，应到指定场所统一实施为期14天免费的康复隔离和医学观察。
On February 22, the Wuhan Municipal New Crown Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued a notice saying that from now on, patients discharged from hospital treatment after the new crown pneumonia patients should be uniformly implemented 14 days of free rehabilitation isolation and medical observation in designated places.
观察期满，身体状况符合条件的解除隔离。
At the end of the observation period, the eligible condition was released.
次日，黄石市也宣布执行上述做法。
The following day, Huangshi City also announced the implementation of the above.
