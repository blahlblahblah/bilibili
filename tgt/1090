湖北省新冠肺炎疫情防控指挥部13日21时召开新闻发布会，邀请中央指导组医疗救治组专家、北京朝阳医院副院长童朝晖、广州支援武汉协和医院医疗队队长、广州医科大学附属第一医院副院长张挪富、武汉金银潭医院院长张定宇等介绍武汉市重症救治进展情况，并回答记者提问。
At 21: 00 a.m., the Hubei Provincial Headquarters for the Prevention and Control of New Grown Pneumonia held a press conference and invited experts from the Central Steering Group, Vice President of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital Tong Chaohui, Guangzhou Support Wuhan Association Hospital Medical Team Leader, Guangzhou Medical University First Affiliated Hospital Zhang Nofu, Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital Director Zhang Dingyu, etc.
Play视频来源：新华视频武汉市金银潭医院院长张定宇表示，医院正在开展康复病人恢复期血浆的输入，目前已显示出初步效果。
The hospital is carrying out plasma input into convalescent patients and is showing initial results, said Zhang Dingyu, director of Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
康复患者体内有大量的综合抗体对抗病毒， 在此恳请康复后的患者积极来到医院，伸出胳膊，捐献血浆，共同拯救还在与病魔作斗争的病人。
The convalescent patient has a large number of antibody to antiviral, in this pleading convalescent patients to come to the hospital, extend their arms, donate plasma, and jointly save the patients who are still struggling with the disease.
针对高龄及有基础疾病患者，张定宇提示，要加强预警监测，发现有不好苗头抓紧处理，没有达到重症标准也可按重症进行治疗。
Zhang Dingyu for the elderly and patients with basic diseases, to strengthen early warning monitoring, to find that there are bad early management, not to meet the serious standards can also be serious treatment.
广州医科大学附属第一医院副院长张挪富表示，传染性的大小，与上呼吸道病毒的载量或者说数量有关系。
Zhang Nofu, vice-president of Guangzhou Medical University's First Affiliated Hospital, said the size of the infection was related to the amount or quantity of the upper respiratory virus.
广州医科大学附属第一医院前一段数据显示，ICU里面大概有60%以上的病人，上下呼吸道都能够检出病毒，而且病毒载量非常高，有的超过10的6次方以上。
Previous figures from Guangzhou Medical University Hospital No. 1 show that more than 60 percent of patients in the ICU can detect the virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and the viral load is very high, some more than 10 times more than 6 times.
同时我们在血液里以及粪便里也找到了病毒，说明重症病人的病毒载量高。
We also found the virus in our blood and feces, indicating a high viral load in critically ill patients.
而在轻症病人里面，上呼吸道病毒载量偏低，但这也不是绝对的，有些轻症病人因为本身老年人免疫力低下，可以作为病毒培养基，所以在早期，老年人会不会上呼吸道病毒载量一定高于轻症，现在没有这个数据。
In light cases, the upper respiratory viral load is low, but it is not absolute. Some light patients have low immunity and can be used as a virus medium. Therefore, in the early years, the elderly will not be able to carry more upper respiratory virus than light disease, this data is not available.
理论上讲重症的传染性高于轻症，尤其是后期，作为病毒培养基可能病毒量更大。
In theory, severe infections are higher than mild ones, especially in the later stages, where viruses may be more abundant as a viral medium.
但轻症病人同样也具有传染性。
But light patients are also infectious.
对于有数据显示60岁以上有重度肺炎的男性感染者是高危人群的问题，张挪富表示，一篇文章得出病死率不具备普遍性意义。
For men over the age of 60 with severe pneumonia who are at high risk, Zhang said an article concluded that the fatality rate was not universal.
病人发病时间、就诊时间、治疗场所、医务团队技术力量等多方面因素都有影响。
The time, time, location and technical strength of the medical team all had an impact.
60岁以上、有重度肺炎、又是高危人群里，在这个人群里有百分之九点多的死亡率是不奇怪的。
It is not surprising that more than 9 out of 10 people over the age of 60 have severe pneumonia and are at high risk.
钟院士团队有一篇文章是对一千多例（病例）的总结，符合这三种条件有30多人，这些人的病死率可能更高。
The Academician team has an article summarizing more than a thousand cases that meet these three conditions and have a higher fatality rate.
一篇文章得出一个数据，对整体病死率没指导或者参考意义。
An article comes up with a figure that does not guide or refer to the overall fatality rate.
北京朝阳医院副院长童朝晖表示，新冠肺炎患者出现的是严重的呼吸衰竭，与03年的SARS相比，病情进展得更快，缺氧发展得很明显；此外，这次患者心脏受到的攻击非常厉害，救治起来的难度比以前要大。
Children suffering from severe respiratory failure are suffering from severe respiratory failure compared with SARS in 2003, said Tong Chaohui, vice-dean of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. In addition, the patient's heart attack was severe and more difficult to treat than before.
因此，我们提出要密切观察这类患者的生命体征，比如心率、血压、血氧的变化。
Therefore, we propose to closely observe the vital signs of such patients, such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen changes.
他同时指出，把临床诊断这个层次加进来以后，有利把很多我们过去认为是疑似的患者，按照临床诊断标准，纳入临床诊断。
He also points out that the addition of the level of clinical diagnosis has facilitated the inclusion of many patients that we used to consider as suspected, in accordance with clinical diagnostic criteria.
有利对临床诊断的患者进行管理。
To facilitate the management of patients with clinical diagnosis.
轻症患者可以进行隔离治疗，也更加有利于收治重症患者。
Minor patients can be isolated treatment, but also more conducive to the treatment of severe patients.
能够让更多的过去认为是疑似患者，符合临床诊断的患者得到一个更好的收治和管理。
To enable more patients who used to be suspected, who meet the clinical diagnosis of a better reception and management.
关于方舱医院的轻症患者符合什么标准要转诊到重症的定点医院？童朝晖透露，方舱医院建设时制定了工作手册，包括收治标准、重症转出标准、诊疗规范等。
About what standard does the light patient of square cabin hospital meet to need to refer to serious point hospital? Tong Chaohui revealed that when the cabin hospital is built, the working manual includes admission criteria, standards of severe transfer, and norms for diagnosis and treatment.
转出的标准包括年龄大、有多种基础疾病，治疗两天后仍大于38.5度，没有自主活动能力等。
The criteria for transfer include old age, multiple underlying diseases, still greater than 38.5 degrees after two days of treatment, lack of autonomy, etc.
新冠病毒特免血浆制品投入临床据国资委官方微博消息，国药中国生物公司已完成对部分康复者血浆的采集工作，开展新冠病毒特免血浆制品和特免球蛋白的制备。
CHINA BIOLOGICAL CO., LTD. According to the official Weibo report of SASAC, the Chinese biologic company has completed the collection of plasma from some of the recovered patients and initiated the preparation of the new crown virus plasma-free products and immunoglobulin.
经过严格的血液生物安全性检测，病毒灭活，抗病毒活性检测等，已成功制备出用于临床治疗的特免血浆！在各方紧密合作下，2月8日，以新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）为指南，首期在江夏区第一人民医院开展了3名危重患者的新冠特免血浆治疗，目前连同后续医院治疗的危重病人超过了10人。
Following rigorous blood bio-safety testing, virus inactivation and antiviral activity testing, special plasma exemption for clinical treatment has been successfully prepared. On February 8, guided by the experimental 5th edition of the New Coronavirus Infection Diagnosis and Treatment Programme, more than 10 critically ill patients were treated together with follow-up hospitals.
临床反映，患者接受治疗12至24小时后，实验室检测主要炎症指标明显下降！淋巴细胞比例上升，血氧饱和度、病毒载量等重点指标全面向好，临床体征和症状明显好转。
Clinical response, 12 to 24 hours after treatment, the main inflammation indicators of laboratory detection significantly decreased! lymphocyte ratio increased, blood oxygen saturation, viral load and other key indicators to improve, clinical signs and symptoms significantly improved.
新冠特免血浆制品是由康复者捐献的含高效价新冠病毒特异性抗体的血浆，经过病毒灭活处理，并对抗新冠病毒中和抗体、多重病原微生物检测后制备而成，用于新冠肺炎危重患者的治疗。
The new crown plasma-free product is the plasma donated by the convalescent patients containing HPCV-specific antibodies, inactivated by virus and prepared against the neutralization antibodies and multiple pathogen microorganisms of the new crown virus for the treatment of critically ill patients with new crown pneumonia.
从临床病理发生过程看，大部分新冠肺炎患者经过治疗康复后，身体内会产生针对新冠病毒的特异性抗体，可杀灭和清除病毒。
In the course of clinical pathology, most patients with new crown pneumonia after treatment and rehabilitation, the body will produce specific antibodies to the new crown virus, can kill and remove the virus.
目前在缺乏疫苗和特效治疗药物的前提下，采用这种特免血浆制品治疗新冠病毒感染是最为有效的方法，可大幅降低危重患者病死率。
At present, in the absence of vaccines and special-effects drugs, this special plasma treatment is the most effective way to significantly reduce the fatality rate of critically ill patients.
国药中国生物公司表示，其承担的“2019-nCoV感染恢复期患者特异血浆和特异免疫球蛋白制备”项目是科技部组织制定的国家重点研发计划“公共安全风险防控与应急技术装备”重点专项。
The Chinese biotech company said its project "Preparation of specific plasma and specific immunoglobulin for patients recovering from 2019-nCoV infection" is a key national research and development plan "Public Safety Risk Prevention and Emergency Technical Equipment" organized by the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Dear Friends of the Survivor Pneumonia: Congratulations on your victory over the disease and getting out of the hospital! Since December 2019, a new type of pneumonia has broken out in Wuhan and spread rapidly across the country, affecting the hearts of 1.4 billion Chinese people.
在党中央、国务院的坚强领导下，全国人民众志成城，立志打赢疫情防控阻击战！当前疫情防控形势依然严峻，还有众多危重病人亟待救治！国家卫生健康委员会发布的《关于印发新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第五版）的通知》，明确提出对重型、危重型病例的治疗可采用恢复期血浆治疗。
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the Chinese people are determined to win the prevention and control battle against the coronavirus.
采用恢复期病人血浆疗法，通过临床输注康复者恢复期血浆或将其制备成特异性免疫球蛋白，疗效较好且安全。
Plasma therapy of convalescent patients was used to prepare specific immunoglobulin through the convalescent plasma of patients undergoing clinical infusion.
SARS爆发期间，就有将SARS患者康复后的血浆输注给重症SARS病人实现治愈的案例。
During the SARS outbreak, there were cases of patients recovering from SARS who had plasma transfusion to severe SARS patients to achieve a cure.
近日，本次新冠肺炎康复者血浆中已检测出高效价病毒中和抗体，实验证明，能够有效杀死新冠病毒，我们用康复者特异血浆临床治疗11例危重病人，治疗效果显著。
