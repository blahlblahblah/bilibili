虽然感染确诊人数不多，但因“非典”时期香港淘大花园E座数百人染病事件，不少港人情绪紧绷，他们期待一系列尚未落地的防疫措施能切实见效文 |《财经》特派记者 焦建 发自中国香港特区编辑 | 苏琦1月30日早上7点30左右，居住在中国香港特区新界的邹欣走出家门，选择搭乘港铁西铁线到位于香港中环的某金融机构返工，“与巴士相比，地铁更快一些，可以减少与外人接触的时间。
Although the number of confirmed cases is low, many people in Hong Kong are feeling tense due to the hundreds of cases of infection at Ease Garden during the SARS period. They expect a series of on-the-spot immunization measures to be effective.
”这已经比其原定于大年初五（1月29日）开始的工作日推迟了一天。
That's a day later than the day it was due to begin on Friday, January 29, the year before.
因处于假期及新型冠状病毒肺炎传播等原因，何时恢复工作是香港特区很多工作族共同关心的热门话题之一。
Due to holiday and the spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia, when to resume work is one of the hot topics of concern to many working people in the HKSAR.
1月28日，中国香港特区政府宣布除紧急和必须的公共服务外，所有公务员1月29日至2月2日可以留在家里工作。
On 28 January, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China announced that, with the exception of emergency and essential public services, all civil servants would be allowed to work from home from 29 January to 2 February.
私营机构的相关安排也在此前后陆续出台。
Arrangements in the private sector have been put in place before and after.
按照邹女士所工作机构的人力资源部门在此前几天的通知安排：除全员推迟一天上班、执行错峰上下班制度（晚到半小时，晚下班半小时）之外，春节假期曾到过中国内地的员工，可以推迟更长时间。
According to the human resources department of the agency where Ms. Zou works, staff who have been to mainland China during the Spring Festival holiday can be put off by more than a few days, in addition to a one-day delay, a staggered working day (half an hour late and half an hour late).
截止1月30日上午10时，最新数据统计显示：香港新型冠状病毒确诊感染人数为10人，无死亡病例，亦无治愈出院病例。
At 10: 00 a.m. on January 30, the latest statistics showed that there were 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Hong Kong.
减少跨境人员流动并不容易1月28日，中国香港特区行政长官林郑月娥共计公布了七方面的防疫措施，包括安排滞留湖北的香港居民返港、向所有非合资格人士收取住院费用、全球范围内搜罗口罩及洗手液等防护用品等。
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR of China, Mrs Carrie Lam, announced on 28 January a total of seven anti-epidemic measures, including arranging the return of Hong Kong residents in Hubei, charging hospital fees to all non-eligible persons, and collecting protective equipment such as face masks and hand sanitizers around the world.
她在当日召开记者会时表示：控制疫情的主要手段是大幅减少内地和香港两地跨境人员流动。
Speaking at a press conference on the same day, she said the main way to control the outbreak was to significantly reduce cross-border movements between the Mainland and Hong Kong.
经过协调，内地将首先停止发放49个城市的“自由行”签证。
After coordination, the mainland will first stop issuing "free-walking" visas to 49 cities.
“相关措施无可避免对往来内地及香港的人士带来不便，但措施是防疫工作中重要的一环，希望获得谅解。
"The measures will inevitably cause inconvenience to people travelling to and from the Mainland and Hong Kong. However, they are an important part of the preventive measures and we hope to gain understanding.
”林郑月娥称。
"said Mrs Lam.
按照相关安排，特区政府将从海、陆、空三方面大幅缩减两地交通服务，包括暂停西九龙站高铁香港段及红磡城际直通车所有班次，内地来港航班班次减半，暂停尖沙咀中国客运码头及屯门码头跨境渡轮服务，同时减少跨境巴士班次。
Under the arrangement, the HKSAR Government will drastically reduce transport services by air, sea and land, including suspension of all West Kowloon MTR and Hung Hom intercity through train services, reduction of Mainland flights by half, suspension of the Tsim Sha Tsui China Ferry Terminal and Tuen Mun Ferry Services, and reduction of cross-boundary bus services.
此外，特区政府亦将暂停部分口岸的客运服务，包括高铁西九龙站口岸、红磡站口岸、沙头角口岸及文锦渡口岸，货运不受影响。
The Government will also suspend passenger services at some ports, including the West Kowloon Station on high-speed rail, Hung Hom, Sha Tau Kok and Man Kam To, with no impact on cargo.
这是继1月26日香港召开应对新型冠状病毒感染疫情的督导委员会暨指挥中心会议推出相关措施后，应对措施的再次升级。
Following the launch of the Steering Committee-cum-Command Centre Meeting on the New Coronavirus Infection in Hong Kong on January 26, the response measures were again stepped up.
按照上述会议相关安排，从1月27日零时零分起，除香港居民外，所有湖北省居民以及任何过去十四天里到过湖北省的人士将不再获准入境香港特区，直至另行通知为止。
According to the above arrangements, from 0000 hours on January 27, all residents of Hubei Province and anyone who has been to Hubei Province in the past 14 days will not be permitted to enter the Region until further notice.
而为了便利执行上述措施，各口岸的自助通道由只开放供香港居民使用，所有非香港居民均须使用一般入境柜台办理入境手续。
To facilitate the implementation of the above measures, self-service channels at boundary control points are open to Hong Kong residents only. All non-Hong Kong residents are required to use the normal immigration counters for immigration clearance.
针对香港社会近日“全面关闭出入境检查站”的呼吁，林郑月娥在1月28日的记者会上也多次重申这样做的影响“非常深远”，也会令许多仍然在外地的香港人暂时无法返回香港。
In response to Hong Kong's recent call for a "complete closure of immigration checkpoints," Mrs Lam reiterated at a press conference on 28 January that the impact of this move was "far reaching" and would temporarily prevent many Hong Kong residents still outside Hong Kong from returning to Hong Kong.
《财经》记者获悉，目前中国内地到香港特区的人士当中，约一半以“自由行”签注到港，20%左右以旅行团到港，其余的则是以商务、探亲或照顾有关要亲友而到港。
According to Caijing, about half of the current arrivals from Mainland China to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region come to Hong Kong on "free-lance," around 20% by package tours and the rest by business, family visits or caring for close friends and relatives.
“虽然仍宣称目前的措施已可尽量减少不必要的两地人流交往。
"Although it is still claimed that the current measures have been able to minimize unnecessary traffic between the two places.
但进出关几率是不是会因为香港舆论等原因进一步降低，心里没底。
But the odds of entry and exit will be further lowered by public opinion in Hong Kong, the bottom line.
”某位持探亲签证的在港内地人士对《财经》记者称，“探亲签证每次入境香港可以连续待90天，希望到时候疫情已经控制住了。
A visitor visa holder from the mainland told Caijing that "family visit visas can stay in Hong Kong for up to 90 days at a time, hoping the outbreak of the disease is under control.
”口罩难买带来 “短缺经济”按照中国香港特区政府公布的消息显示：在防疫抗疫方面，特区政府的财政资源不是问题，惟物资供应方面相对紧张。
The financial resources of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are not a problem, but the supply of materials is relatively tight, according to a report released by the Hong Kong SAR Government.
特区政府已在全球范围搜罗相关物资，包括口罩及洗手液等，尽快保障市面充足供应。
The SAR Government has conducted a global search for relevant materials, including surgical masks and hand sanitizers, to ensure an adequate supply in the market as soon as possible.
因“非典”时期香港淘大花园E座数百人染病事件留下的记忆犹新，不少港人的情绪变得紧张，上述这些尚未完全落地的措施带来的正向效果仍有待见效。
The positive impact of these measures has yet to be felt, given the memories of the hundreds of cases of infection in Amoy Garden in Hong Kong during the SARS period, and the nervousness of many people in Hong Kong.
据《财经》记者春节前后期间在香港旺角、新界等多区观察：春节之前，虽有疫病消息，但口罩、消毒火酒（酒精）等物资的供应仍显正常，街上戴口罩并不普遍；从大年初一至今，短缺情况开始加剧，街上戴口罩者已经十之八九。
According to Caijing reporter before and after the Spring Festival in Mong Kok, New Territories and other areas of Hong Kong: Although there was news of epidemics before the Spring Festival, the supply of masks, disinfectant spirits (alcohol) and other materials remained normal and masks were not common on the streets.
以《财经》记者目前在香港所居楼宇附近的口罩销售情况为例：一款日本产的白色防花粉及病毒口罩，年初三时虽已涨至180元/盒（50个，港币），药房货架上的存货依然不少；次日上午时成人口罩已然售罄，只剩小童口罩；次日下午时多家店铺已然摆出“口罩、火酒、消毒液统统扫清”的瓦楞纸牌子。
An example is the sale of face masks by Caijing journalists near their current premises in Hong Kong. A Japanese-made white anti-pollen and virus mask has increased to HK $180 / case by the third day of the year. Adult masks are sold out the next morning, leaving only child masks.
香港旺角一家药房的老板表示：上周时来货价格低，每盒零售价120元仍有得赚。
The owner of a pharmacy in Mong Kok, Hong Kong, said: Last week the merchandise came in at a low price and the retail price of 120 yuan per box was still profitable.
28日时再想向日本厂商订货，进价就涨了十几倍，再加上运费，春节人工及铺租，每盒随时会涨到超过千元，“与其被人骂黑心，不如不订了。
If you want to order from a Japanese manufacturer by 28 May, your purchase price will go up a dozen times. In addition, the freight charges, the labor cost of the Spring Festival and the rental of shops will rise to more than 1,000 yuan every time.
”连锁超市方面的情况亦并不乐观：1月29及30日，香港多家屈臣氏、万宁等大型日用品店前普遍排出长长的人龙，部分店铺前甚至出现“打蛇饼”（绕圈排队）；在一家店铺前，虽然卷帘门上已经挂出香港物资售罄的告示，但依然有不少人士排队“碰运气”；在一家号称已从泰国进货的超市，因存货迅速售完，还出现了老板被围不得不关闸的事件。
Supermarket chains are not so sanguine: on January 29 and 30, long dragons were thrown out in front of large grocery stores such as Watson's and Vanning's. Some shops even had snakesakes in front of them.
伴随着口罩短缺出现的，是蔬菜等相关日常生活食品的价格也随之上涨。
Along with the shortage of face masks, the price of vegetables and other related daily food has also risen.
香港商超及街市零售网络发达，大多数香港家庭并没有过年期间大量积存果蔬及肉类等食物的习惯。
Hong Kong has a well-developed retail market network. Most Hong Kong households do not accumulate food such as fruits and vegetables and meat during the New Year.
以豌豆苗为例，年初一时每半斤（香港十六两为一斤）三四十元左右的价格比之平日已经翻倍，但当时仍以为是春节因素。
Take pea seedlings for example, at the beginning of the year, the price of about $30. 40 per half catty (16-2 Hong Kong is 1 jin) doubled the usual price, but it was still considered the Spring Festival factor.
随后年初五时芥蓝等日常菜蔬也从十八元/两斤涨至二十元/斤，让越来越多的香港人感受到疫病带来的“短缺经济”的影响。
At the beginning of the year, mustard and other daily vegetables rose from 18 yuan / 2 jin to 20 yuan / kg, making more and more people in Hong Kong feel the effects of the epidemic.
“新界等地仍有农民种菜，加之与深圳连接交通便利，菜价这几天才涨。
"There are still farmers planting vegetables in the New Territories and it's easy to connect with Shenzhen and vegetable prices have gone up only these days.
港岛地区只有商超的小区内，每斤菜上百元还要抢。
Hong Kong Island only commercial ultra small area, per catty of vegetables will have to steal $100.
”邹欣如此形容其同事们的遭遇。
Zou describes what happened to her colleagues.
伴随着口罩短缺出现的，还有线下连锁店等销售网络开始推销其网上商城的服务。
Along with the shortage of masks, sales networks such as offline chains began marketing their online shopping mall services.
但以前述连锁超市为例，虽然其宣称可在网上订购口罩等服务，但因网站承受能力并未做好准备，一下用来的顾客使其瘫痪了很长一段时间；亦有书店发邮件告知读者称：为抗疫病，防疫卫生用品及保健图书促销优惠。
But in the case of supermarket chains that claim to be able to order masks online, customers were paralyzed for a long time because of their inability to afford them, and bookstores sent e-mails informing readers of promotional discounts on anti-epidemic, anti-epidemic and health-care products.
但其所售商品并无口罩，而只是环保消毒除臭喷雾、抗病毒随身小挂包等。
However, the products sold are not masks, but only environmental disinfection deodorant spray, anti-virus hanging bag and so on.
同样伴随着口罩短缺出现的，是香港卫生防疫等相关公共服务体系所承担的压力日益增大。
Also accompanied by a shortage of face masks, Hong Kong health and epidemic prevention related public service system under increasing pressure.
受达标保护设备相对欠缺等因素影响，不时传出有香港相关人员申请休假的消息。
Due to factors such as the relative lack of compliance protection equipment, from time to time there is news that Hong Kong-related personnel apply for leave.
此外令各界担心的是：一方面，因难以买到口罩，重复使用的现象在香港日益增加；另一方面，假冒伪劣出现的几率也不断提升。
There is also concern that re-use of masks is increasing in Hong Kong due to difficulties in purchasing them, and that fake and inferior products are on the rise.
为增加口罩供应，中国香港特区政府商经局发言人则在回应相关查询时表示：政府一直和内地部门沟通，如通过两地海关协作，就政府采购的个别批次跟进清关，呼吁业界代表，如就个别批次在采购和清关遇问题，可向政府提供具体资料以便跟进，海关则循消费品安全、商标和商品说明，例如产地来源三方面加强巡查，防止违法销售。
To increase the supply of face masks, a spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Affairs Bureau of the HKSAR Government said in response to enquiries, the Government has been communicating with Mainland authorities, such as following up on individual shipments of government procurement through Customs collaboration, calling on trade representatives to provide specific information to the Government for follow-up action.
“当前香港民情的复杂性，不下于疫情……倘若当局处理失当，有可能引爆另一场‘完美风暴’。
"People in Hong Kong are as complex as the epidemic... if the authorities mismanage, they could set off another 'perfect storm'."
防疫要科学，沟通要贴地，政府需要更多切实行动安抚人心，纾缓物资供应紧张，做好心理预期管理，同时设法疏导医护不满情绪……让市民心里有底，连口罩供应也搞不好，很难稳住人心。
The government needs more concrete actions to appease people, relieve material shortages, manage psychological expectations, and manage medical discontent... so that the public has the heart and mind, and even the supply of masks is difficult to stabilize.
”1月30日，香港一家媒体在社论中呼吁称。
On January 30, a Hong Kong media outlet called for an editorial.
更多的香港人，则想起了前任中国香港特区特首董建华的夫人董赵洪娉，她在2003年非典时期到牛头角下邨探访时提醒长者注意个人卫生：“千祈千祈千祈，洗手洗手洗手（记住记住记住，洗手洗手洗手）。
More people in Hong Kong are reminded of former wife of Tung Chee Hung, former Chief Executive of the HKSAR, Tung Chee Hung, who reminded elders of personal hygiene during a visit to Ngau Tau Kok Estate in 2003: "Wash hands, hands and hands (remember to remember, wash hands and hands).
