在最后一刻，鄢小文放弃了司法鉴定，选择接受了有关方面的调解以及补偿方案。
At the last minute, Yan Xiao Wen dropped the forensic examination and opted for mediation and compensation.
他选择接受调解方案的初衷非常简单，只希望鄢成可以走得安静，平静。
His original choice for the mediation program was simple, and he just wanted Yan Cheng to walk quietly and quietly.
在儿子鄢成离世九天里，一直陪伴着鄢小文以及参与有关部门进行谈判的雷建威律师、刘珒律师、大米以及蜗牛家园的负责人朱文沁均表示了对鄢小文这一举动的理解。
Yan's son Yan Cheng died nine days later, accompanied by Yan Xiaowen, a lawyer named Lei Jianwei, lawyer Liu Zheng, rice and Zhu Wenqin, director of the snail's home, all of whom negotiated with Yan Xiaowen.
2月6日上午，鄢成的尸体已经火化，有关方面补偿款也已到账。
On the morning of February 6, Yan Cheng's body was cremated and compensation received.
应大米之邀，仍然被隔离在病房的鄢小文一字一句在微信端敲下了他想对外界说的话。
Invited by the rice, Yan Xiaowen, still isolated in the ward, rapped on the microphone what he wanted to say to the world.
儿子走后，我最懊悔的是……文|鄢小文17岁脑瘫少年鄢成的父亲武汉心智障碍群体公益组织“蜗牛家园”骨干家长今天是元宵，祝大家节日安好，我已经连续四五天没再发烧了，各方面的症状都在减轻，宏伟的安置隔离也得到了比较妥善的安排，2月3日他就被接到了另一个医院，由一名护理人员和特教老师照料。
When my son left, what I most regretted was... Yan Xiaowen, 17, a father of 17-year-old cerebral palsy teenager Yan Cheng's father, the backbone of Wuhan's mental disability group, the Snail Home, a public welfare organization.
想他的时候，我就忍不住拨通护理人员的微信视频，可不知道是不是手机的视觉提示不够明显，这小子大多数时候都不怎么搭理我，只忙着看他的动画片……这时候，我又总忍不住想到他的哥哥——鄢成，尽管不会说话，但只要看到他，他就会立即绽放出大大的笑脸，整宿整宿，我躺在床上，睁眼闭眼，脑海里都是他的笑脸。
When I think of him, I cannot help dialing the microphone videos of the paramedic, not knowing if the phone's visual cues are not obvious enough, and the guy mostly ignores me and watches his cartoons.
鄢成笑得越开心，就越发让我痛苦，别人都夸我是个好父亲，一直把鄢成照顾得干干净净、体体面面的，可是这哪里够呢？如果我是个有能耐的父亲，鄢成或许可以康复得更好，可以实现一定程度的自理，那么他的生活质量可能就会更好，甚至他都可能不会死在这场灾难里。
The happier Yan Cheng was, the more painful it was for me to be praised as a good father, and Yansheng was always well cared for and well mannered, but if I was a capable father, Yansheng might be able to recover better, achieve a degree of self-care, and possibly even survive the disaster.
鄢成死在冠状病毒横行的2020年，出生在非典祸民的2003年。
Yan Cheng died in the coronavirus-infested year 2020, born in 2003 in the wake of SARS.
他多灾多难的一生，从他出生那一刻就开始了。
His troubled life began from the moment he was born.
我爱人生鄢成的时候，遇到了难产，当时孩子是医生用钳子夹出来的。
I love life by Yan Cheng and experienced difficulty in giving birth when doctors clamped the baby out with pliers.
一出生，鄢成就被送进了ICU的保温箱，当时非典很严重，我们只能在玻璃外面守着他，在保温箱里待了21天，鄢成才回到了我们怀里。
Upon birth, the Visayas achievement was sent to the ICU incubator, where SARS was so severe that we had to watch him outside the glass and stay in the incubator for 21 days before the Visayas were back in our arms.
那时候我们什么都不懂，只以为保住了他的命就是最好的结果了，结果，鄢成半岁了才被诊断为重度脑瘫。
At that time, we knew nothing but that saving his life was the best outcome. As a result, Yan Cheng was half a year old before being diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy.
现在想来，我唯一无悔的就是从没放弃过鄢成，村里很多人一直劝我放弃了，但我们夫妻还是坚持带着孩子康复，我当时一个月工资1200，而鄢成一个月的康复就是我半年的收入。
Now, the only thing I don't regret is that Yan Cheng never gave up. Many in the village urged me to give up. But we still managed to get well with our children.
我们存的几万块钱，几个月的康复就花光了，我跟爱人常常靠吃馒头配开水、咸菜过日子。
We saved tens of thousands of dollars, a few months of recovery spent, my wife and I often live on steamed bread with boiled water, pickled vegetables.
一直坚持到了2009年，宏伟出生后，鄢成的康复治疗就几乎被放下了。
By 2009, when Yan Cheng's rehabilitation treatment was almost complete, Yan Cheng was given up.
2015年，我又下岗了，找不到工作，只能带着他们兄弟俩靠低保和社会的接济为生。
In 2015, I was laid off again, unable to find work, and had to take my brothers with me to live on subsistence and social support.
因此，这么多年来，我对鄢成只有无尽的愧疚。
Thus, for so many years, I felt only infinite guilt towards Yan Cheng.
鄢成走后，我向政府提的前两条要求，第一是鄢成的后事等我出院后再办理；第二是我想把鄢成的遗体捐献出来。
The first two requests I made to the government after Yan Cheng left the hospital were, first, that Yancheng's family should wait until I was discharged from hospital; and secondly, that I should donate the body of Yan Cheng.
但由于疫情严重，这两个愿望都实现不了，目前我的家乡红安，疫情严重，各方面的防治工作也都很困难，我也只能劝自己放下，换位思考，以大局为重。
However, due to the severity of the outbreak, neither of these two wishes can be realized. At present, my hometown of Hong An is very serious, and the prevention and control work is very difficult in all aspects.
这些天来，我常常失眠，我是多么希望鄢成能留下一点东西在这个世上啊！鄢成走后，除了懊悔没能给他提供理想的康复和生活外，我懊悔的还有，我一直保持的沉默。
These days, I often suffer from insomnia, and how I wish Yan Cheng would leave something in the world! Yansheng went away, regretting that, in addition to regretting the failure to provide him with an ideal recovery and livelihood, I regretted my silence.
这么多年，我带着孩子悄悄生活在世人看不到的角落里，等人发声，等国家政策倾斜。
Over the years, I have lived quietly with my children in invisible corners, waiting for voices to be heard, waiting for national policies to tilt.
可经历了鄢成的死后，我才深刻地看到，心智障碍家长，甚至家长组织的力量依然很弱小，而政策也不是等来的。
But after Yan Cheng's death, it became clear to me that parents with mental disabilities, and even parents "organizations, remain weak and that policies are not always forthcoming.
无论是鄢成在世时，还是去世后，都得到了心智障碍圈里很多人的帮助，我没有能力承诺如何报答别人，只求以后一定要站出来，尽自己最大的努力，去为这个圈做更有意义的事情，鄢成在冥冥中也一定会支持爸爸，因为他对这个世界一直是感恩的。
Yansheng lived and died with the help of many in the world of mental disability. I was unable to commit myself to rewarding others. Instead, I asked to step forward and do my best to do more meaningful things for the Circle. Yan Cheng was sure to support Dad in his quiet time because he was grateful for the world.
借此机会，我也恳求家长们能够团结起来，力朝一处使，一个拳头打出去，我们发出的声音才能影响更多人，从而推动国家政策为我们的孩子和家庭，提供实实在在的支持和帮助体系。
I also take this opportunity to implore parents to come together and strike one fist at a time, so that our voices can reach more people, and thus promote national policies that provide real support and help systems for our children and families.
而如果鄢成的死能为这个体系的建立，贡献一点点力量，那他也算死得有意义了。
And if Yan Cheng's death could contribute a little bit to the establishment of the system, he would be dead.
鄢成以惨痛的生命之殇，凸显了巨大的社会价值文|雷建威广东省残疾人联合会副主席广东省智力残疾人及亲友协会会长广东诺臣律师事务所创始合伙人颇感欣慰鄢爸接受了我们协助调解的结果。
Yan Cheng Yan Cheng, with a tragic death toll, highlights the great social value & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 160; & # 160; & # 160;
这是一个特殊的时期，疫情紧张，每一个有良知的人都在为受灾人群揪心。
This is a special period, the outbreak of tension, every person with conscience in the victims of panic.
我自己是十多年的志愿者，汶川和玉树地震时都去过一线赈灾，故这次也不愿袖手旁观，特别希望能做点有价值的事。
I myself is more than 10 years of volunteers, Wenchuan and Yushu earthquake have been to the first line of relief, so this time also unwilling to stand aside, especially hope to do something of value.
鄢成一家代表了一个特殊群体——残疾人及其家属，我在广东省智力残疾人及亲友协会担当工作，一直与智障人士及其家人打交道，深深感受他们的种种不易。
The Yan Cheng family represents a special group - persons with disabilities and their families. I work in the Guangdong Association of Persons with Intellectual Disabilities and Relatives and Relatives. I have been working with people with intellectual disabilities and their families and feel deeply about their difficulties.
我与鄢小文同为家长，就是同路人，危难之时相互搀扶，自是义不容辞。
Yan Xiaowen and I are parents and fellow travelers alike, helping each other in times of crisis.
而且他们一家的故事让我动容，鄢小文的大儿子脑瘫，小儿子自闭，太太无法面对而选择轻生……鄢小文十多年来舔犊情深，尽己所能照顾两个孩子，真的是个“中国好爸爸”，他家有难，尤其必须帮。
And the family story moved me, Yan Xiaowen's eldest son was paralyzed, his youngest son shut up, and his wife was unable to cope with it... Yan Xiaowen licked her calf for more than a decade and did all she could to care for two children.
最后，鄢成的死的确冤！咱们心智障碍领域那么多厉害的人物组了一个支援团在背后鼎力支持，地方残联也给予了诸多的协助，终究未能阻挡悲剧的发生……这当中有关方必然存在着开脱不了的重大责任，法律的专业背景提醒我，必须要为鄢成之死讨要公道！应该说，我们律师团队参与后，看到有关方面还是勇于面对过错、承担责任，从事后红安县委很快对相关干部问责免职可见一斑，调解工作较为顺利，双方摆出方案，很快就达成一致，补偿金也是迅速到账。
In the end, Yan Cheng's death was a real injustice! With the support of so many powerful people in the field of mental disorders and the help of local disability associations, we were unable to stop the tragedy.
鄢成事件，也带动社会很多的思考，让全国各地残联进一步在疫情防控工作中，加强了对被确诊、被隔离残疾人及其家属的看护照顾问题的关注和重视，也直接促进北京市晓更助残公益基金会，启动了由全国数以百计的家长组织共同参与构建的特殊需要困难家庭紧急救助机制。
The Yansheng Incident also prompted a lot of thought in the community, prompting the FIMITIC across the country to pay more attention and attention to the care and care of persons with confirmed and isolated disabilities and their families. It has also directly promoted the Beijing Dawn Foundation for the Disabled and launched the Emergency Relief Mechanism for Families with Special Needs, which involves hundreds of parents' organizations nationwide.
鄢成以惨痛的生命之殇，凸显了巨大的社会价值。
Yan Cheng Yan to tragic death, highlighted the great social value.
调解后鄢成已入土为安，希望鄢小文尽快走出阴霾，尽快康复痊愈出院，祝弟弟宏安健康快乐成长！鄢成在天有灵，请安息吧！鄢成走后，我想问的和我看到的文|朱文沁武汉心智障碍群体公益组织“蜗牛家园”负责人整个“鄢成事件”的亲历者、参与者鄢成走后，众多媒体报道让事件引发了大量的关注，但如何帮他做好善后，仍是我们的一大难题。
Yansheng Yansheng was buried by Yan Cheng and hopes that Yan Xiaowen will emerge from the haze as soon as possible and get well and leave the hospital as soon as possible.Yan Cheng asks my brother Hong An to rest in peace!
我一度很迷惘无助，尤其是和鄢爸沟通不畅的时候，我觉得自己就快要不行了，撑不下去了。
I was at a loss and helpless, especially when I was having trouble communicating with Yan Da. I felt like I was going to die and couldn't go on.
其间，我曾发过好几次求助信息给外界。
In the meantime, I sent several requests for help.
幸亏有大米和雷建威主席从精神上到专业上的支持，我才又找到了方向。
Thanks to the moral and professional support of Chairman Lui Jianwei, I was able to find my way again.
所以我想特别这两个人（团队），感谢大米的帮助和担当，感谢雷主席所在的广东诺臣律师事务所这个非常有正义感的团队。
So I would like to thank these two people in particular for the help and commitment of rice, as well as President Lei's Guangdong Nochen Law Firm, a very just team.
回顾整个鄢成事件，我也不禁想问：如果没有一个健全的完善保障体系，当灾难来临的时候，我们的家庭，我们的孩子往往不堪一击，谁来做我们的防护墙？是否这个体系的进步都得付出血和泪的代价？在这次事件中，所有出来援助的都是家长，而非政府方面，我们家长群体的代表是否能被吸纳进残联系统或者民政系统，真正做到有责任，有监督？同时，我也看到这次事件暴露两个层面的问题，第一，面对疫情，前期的宣传和防控措施不到位，地方政府部门无预案，面临大事件不知所措，无作为；另一方面，残疾人保障也做得不到位，关心残疾人流于表面文章，真正的困难来临时，没有及时拿出处理办法。
In retrospect, Yan Cheng also asked: Without a sound safeguard system, when disaster strikes, our families, our children are often vulnerable, and who is really responsible and monitoring the progress of the system?
原来，对残疾人的关爱不是一两句口号，而是关系到他们的吃喝拉撒睡生病。
It turns out that caring for the disabled is not a slogan, but about their eating, drinking, and sleeping sickness.
去年，曾经听到过一个这样的统计数据，重度残疾人在父母亲离世后平均存活率是一年。
Last year, one such statistic was heard that the average survival rate of persons with severe disabilities after the death of their parents was one year.
身为家长，我们痛心忧虑的同时，也不能等、不能靠，实际上暂时我们也等不得、靠不得。
As parents, we can't wait, we can't trust, we can't wait, we can't trust.
从现在开始，我们要为我们的身后安排做点实实在在的事情，因为明天我们永远无法预料。
From now on, we are going to have to do something real behind us, because tomorrow we will never know.
监护人不在时谁能够承担照料残疾人的责任文|刘珒广东诺臣律师事务所律师鄢成案中替鄢家争取权益的调解律师我是土生土长的湖北人，能够参与到本次纠纷解决的进程中，帮助鄢成爸爸与相关责任方调解并取得效果，我觉得自己做了一件有意义的事。
Who can assume responsibility for the care of the disabled in the absence of a guardian Ren Yan, a lawyer at Guangdong Nochen Law Firm Yan Cheng. A native of Hubei province, I am a native of Hubei province who helped Yan Cheng mediate with the responsible parties and achieve results.
我参与本案时，17岁的鄢成已经去世了。
Yansheng, 17, died when I was involved in the case.
力之所及的是通过民事救济的方式为鄢成爸爸拿到合法合理的赔偿。
All that is possible is to obtain legal and reasonable compensation for Yan Cheng's father by way of civil relief.
但不管怎么努力，鄢成离世的事实都无法改变。
But the fact that Yan Cheng died cannot be changed, no matter how hard he tried.
我想：这是个案吗？这是意外吗？不是。
I thought: Is this an individual case? Is it an accident? No.
在鄢成爸爸被隔离时，由于鄢成生活不能自理，此时，照料鄢成生活的“监护人”是缺位的。
When Yan Cheng's father was quarantined, Yan Cheng Yan lived by herself, when Yan Cheng's "guardian" was missing.
好像各方都在为照料鄢成付出努力，但结果告诉我们，各方的努力都不够。
It seems that efforts are being made to care for Yan Cheng, but they tell us that they are not doing enough.
那么，“监护人”不在的时候谁能够承担照料残疾人的责任呢？这方面的主体缺位，机制缺失是造成悲剧的根本原因。
Then, when the "guardian" is not available, who can assume the responsibility of caring for the disabled? This aspect of the main body is absent, the lack of the mechanism is the root cause of the tragedy.
解决这个问题，需要全社会的努力。
Solving this problem requires the efforts of the whole society.
而本案最让人痛心的是“是不为也，非不能也！”我们明明有妥善照料鄢成的能力，却因为防护物资不足，医护人员害怕感染不愿照料鄢成。
The most distressing aspect of this case is that "neither can nor can we" We obviously have the ability to take proper care of Yan Cheng, but because of inadequate protective equipment, doctors and nurses are reluctant to take care of Yan Cheng for fear of infection.
从1月22日到1月29日，整整7天没有解决照料鄢成的问题。
Care by Yan Cheng was not addressed for seven full days, from January 22 to January 29.
一再的拖延错过了救治的良机，为什么？因为这个群体缺乏关爱、缺乏机制保障、缺乏呼救渠道。
Repeated delays miss out on treatment opportunities, and why? Because of this group's lack of care, lack of institutional safeguards, and lack of access to help.
鄢成的离去为所有残障群体打开了一扇权利救济的窗口，引来社会的聚焦，人民的关注。
Yan Cheng's departure opens a window of rights relief for all disabled people, drawing social attention and attention.
我相信，今天的权利救济只是一个开始，让我们更多的关注残疾人群体，让这个世界更有温度。
I believe that today's entitlement relief is just the beginning of a much more focused and warmer world for people with disabilities.
雷建威律师作为广东诺臣律师事务所的创始合伙人，自2002年创所以来，一直倡导全所员工积极参加社会公益活动。
As a founding partner of Northumbrian Law Firm in Guangdong Province, Mr. Lei Jianwei has been advocating the active participation of all staff in public welfare activities since its inception in 2002.
鄢成爸爸能够信任我们，委托我们提供法律服务，是我们的荣幸。
It is an honour for Yan Cheng's father to be able to trust us and entrust us with legal services.
作为法律人，我们倡导社会的公平正义，希望通过个案代理实现制度设计者埋藏在法律条文中的正义。
As legal persons, we advocate social equity and justice, and hope to realize justice hidden in the legal system by case agents.
每个诺臣人都愿意为残障群体伸出援手，以我们的专业服务帮助他们维护合法权利。
Every nobleman is willing to lend a helping hand to the disabled and to use our professional services to help them assert their legal rights.
朱文沁女士是位典型的湖北热心肠，此次事件中，她像高音喇叭一样不断为鄢成呼救，手机发出了无数个求援电话、短信，最终引起了社会对鄢成的关注；鄢成去世后，她不停地为鄢成爸爸提供心理疏导，帮助他维护权利。
Typical of Hubei's warm heart, she sounded like a megaphone for Yancheng, sending countless phone calls and text messages to help Yan Cheng, and finally drawing attention to Yan Cheng. When Yan Cheng died, she continued to provide her father with psychological guidance and help him assert his rights.
我为有你这样的老乡而倍感骄傲。
I'm proud to have a fellow citizen like you.
感谢大米和小米以及参与报道此事的媒体朋友，社会的良好运行离不开媒体的监督与宣传，是你们的呐喊呼救引来了各方关注，是你们的每篇报道让我们热泪盈眶，是你们作为媒体人的坚持打开了残疾人维权的新窗口。
Thanks to rice and millet and the media friends involved in this matter, the good functioning of society cannot be separated from the media supervision and publicity, it is your cry for help that has attracted the attention of all sides, is your every report let us tears, your insistence as media people opened a new window for the rights of persons with disabilities.
你们的工作让我们觉得社会在不断进步，有你们在，真好！期盼读到你们更多的报道。
Your work makes us feel that the society is progressing, and it's nice to have you here! I look forward to reading more of your stories.
