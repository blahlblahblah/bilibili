文|王大湿投稿邮箱 | gayspot_edit@163.com新冠疫情在意大利爆发之后，当地又出现了新一轮的排华风潮。
A new wave of Chinese defection followed by the outbreak of a new outbreak of gayspot _ edit @ 163.com in Italy.
华人走在马路上会被指着骂“病毒”。
Chinese walk on the road will be pointed at the "virus."
一家意大利电视台竟公然说“这种病毒会在中国大肆感染，是因为他们的医疗不先进”。
An Italian television station openly said that "the virus will infect China because their medical care is not advanced."
石阳石“坐不住了”。
Shi Yangshi "can not sit down."
石阳石是谁？作为一个中国移民，一个同志，一个演员，他在意大利如何扮演自己的身份？1.5代移民在石洋石的记忆里，第一次坐飞机的旅程是那么漫长，十几个小时蜷缩在经济舱，引擎发出的声波持续冲击着耳蜗。
Who is Shiyang Shi? As a Chinese immigrant, a comrade, an actor, how does he play his role in Italy? For 1.5 generations of immigrants in stone, the first flight was so long that he spent more than ten hours curled up in economy class, and the sound waves from his engine continued to pound the cochlea.
那是1990年3月，他只有11岁。
It was March 1990. He was 11 years old.
飞机落地，舱门打开，他们一家以移民的身份来到意大利，相对于成人，那些跟随父母一起来意大利的孩子被称为1.5代移民，他后来回忆说，那次旅程的结束也是自己童年的结束。
The plane landed, the hatch opened, the family came to Italy as immigrants, and the children who came to Italy with their parents were called the 1.5-generation emigrants, as opposed to adults, who later recalled that the end of the journey was also the end of their childhood.
母亲原先在国内是中医，在意大利却不能行医，父亲是国有企业的进出口经理，来到意大利发现，能发挥原本职业技能的领域并不多。
My mother, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in the country, was unable to practise medicine in Italy, where her father, an import and export manager of a state-owned enterprise, came to Italy and found that there were not many areas in which she could develop original vocational skills.
为了生活能够继续，母亲和初代移民一样开始在餐馆打工，他也做起了洗碗工。
In order to continue his life, his mother began to work as a restaurant worker, as did the first generation of immigrants.
父亲则在沙滩上做起了按摩生意，从推拿到拔罐无一不精通，后来竟在那一片变成小有名气的人物。
My father started the massage business on the beach. He could do everything from massage to cupping, and then he became a famous man there.
石阳石跟着父亲跑前跑后，当父亲给客人服务的时候，他就在一旁推销遮阳伞。
Shiyang-shi follows his father around, selling sunshade while his father serves the guests.
地中海气候宜人，沙滩上常年不缺游客，石洋石卖的伞是从义乌商人那里批发来的，伞面装点着生动的颜色和图案，相较于颜色沉闷的东欧货，竟凭空夹杂着异域的美感，大众的表现有时显得盲目，可并不妨碍遮阳伞被销售一空。
The Mediterranean climate is pleasant, there is no shortage of tourists on the beach, stone umbrella from Yiwu wholesale from Yiwu, the umbrella is decorated with vivid colors and patterns, compared to the dull color of Eastern European goods, mixed with foreign beauty, the performance of the public sometimes appears blind, but does not prevent the sun umbrella from being sold out.
他当时以为，这就是意大利人的不同之处吧。
This, he thought, was what made the Italians different.
进入学校后，石阳石渐从别人的眼里看到自己是个不同者，他带着煮熟的鸡蛋去学校，被同学嘲笑“到死”；同学约他晚上出来聚会，却被父母强令待在家里。
When he entered the school, Shi Yang saw that he was a different person from other people's eyes. He took cooked eggs to school and was laughed at "to death" by his classmates.
辗转在家庭和学校这两个不同的圈子，不同者的身份给他带来很多困惑，他自问，“我在中国出生，所以自己就是中国人吗？我在意大利长大，所以就是意大利人吗？”身边很多意大利人对他说，你跟别的中国人不一样，其他一些人比较封闭。
"I was born in China, so I'm Chinese? I grew up in Italy, so I'm Italian?" A lot of Italians around him said to him, "You're different from other Chinese, other people are more closed.
意大利人和华人在当地各有各的生活圈，彼此之间很少来往，而华人多来自浙江，宗族和语言差异让来自山东的石阳石一家很难与他们产生交集。
The Italians and the Chinese each have their own life cycles and have little interaction with each other. The ethnic and linguistic differences make it difficult for the Shiyang family from Shandong to mingle with them.
他不得不将更多精力投入到对意大利文化的了解上，“意大利语的动词非常复杂，我和妈妈坐有轨电车也在学；卷舌音不会发，当时我在一家西安人开的餐馆里做收银等杂活，跟着他家二女儿学，她教我用‘漱口法’发卷舌音，我漱了3个月，终于会发这个音了。
He had to devote more energy to his knowledge of Italian culture. "The Italian verbs were so complicated that my mother and I were learning trolley cars; I could not pronounce the words while I was doing cashier and other chores at an Xi'an restaurant.
”石阳石说。
'she said.
在学校里，石阳石渐渐成为一个有着东方面孔的“意大利人”，与中国相似，罗马文明借助不断吸收和容纳周边民族才得以延续数千年，但是他清楚，“黄眼睛，黄皮肤，这些东西是改变不了的。
At school, Shi Yangshi became an "Italian" with an oriental face. Like China, Roman civilization was able to absorb and accommodate people for thousands of years, but he knew, "Yellow eyes, yellow skin, these things can't change.
”2002年，巩俐将去威尼斯电影节做评委的消息在意大利华人社群里传播。
In 2002, Gong Li spread the word among the Italian Chinese community about going to the Venice Film Festival as a judge.
当时正在米兰博科尼大学读书的石阳石觉得这是一个很好的机会，于是便请学校的系主任及中国驻米兰的文化参赞等人向威尼斯电影节推荐。
Shi Yangshi, who was studying at Milan's Boconi University at the time, thought it was a good opportunity and asked the head of the department and the cultural attaché of China in Milan to recommend it to the Venice Film Festival.
之后他在威尼斯电影节上担任了巩俐的翻译工作，并结识了田壮壮、李少红等一众中国导演，至此，他的一只脚在不经意间踏进了艺术的殿堂。
Then he worked as a translator for Gong Li at the Venice Film Festival and met Tian Zhuang and Li Shaohong, among other Chinese directors, so that his foot inadvertently stepped into the temple of art.
石阳石在话剧《香蕉人》不同者从大学毕业后，石阳石没有投身到当时风头正劲的外贸，而是选择了戏剧作为自己的事业。
Shi Yang Shi after the drama "Banana Man" different people graduated from the university, Shi Yangshi did not participate in the then trendy foreign trade, but chose drama as their own business.
多年的异国生活，那种不同者的身份感时常令他窒息，而戏剧给了他表达的机会。
After so many years in a foreign country, his sense of identity as a different person often choked him, and drama gave him the chance to express himself.
2011年12月至2012年12月，他工作的孔普斯特剧场在普拉托举办了10场对话活动，名为“我在这里是因为……”，数百名意大利人和华人一起叙说自己来到普拉托的故事。
From December 2011 to December 2012, the Kempster Theatre, where he works, held 10 dialogues in Prato entitled "I'm here because..." and hundreds of Italians and Chinese told the story of their arrival in Prato.
石阳石把跟随父亲四处卖伞的经历搬上舞台。
Shi brought his father's experience of parachuting around to the stage.
与主流华人的看法不同，“我没有把早年打工的经历当成一件凄苦的事情，它就是我所经历一部分。
Contrary to the mainstream Chinese view, "I did not regard my early work experience as a miserable thing. It was part of my experience.
”表演是成功的，不过当时移民的议题并不能成为意大利社会关注的焦点，剧场一度出现运营危机，从人数最多时的90人一度减少到仅剩3人。
The show was a success, but the issue of immigration was not the focus of Italian society at the time, and there was an operational crisis at the theatre, which briefly shrank from a peak of 90 to just three.
21世纪的头十年，正是中国经济起飞的年代，无数中国人漂洋过海，意图追随先辈的足迹，在异域寻得财富。
In the first decade of the 21st century, just as China's economy is taking off, countless Chinese are sailing across oceans in an attempt to follow in the footsteps of their forefathers and find wealth in other lands.
但一些华人为了挣钱排斥社会，甚至无视规则，也不难怪被意大利人视为“封闭”。
But some Chinese even ignore the rules in order to earn money, and it is not surprising that Italians see them as "closed."
2013年1月，普拉托一家华人服装厂发生火灾，当时天色刚蒙蒙亮，大多人还在睡梦中，工厂里存储着大量服装面料，火灾引燃了整个厂房，即便有消防人员施救，大火仍燃烧近四小时，浓烟遮蔽了太阳，普拉托是意大利纺织中心之一，大部分华人都在从事服装加工，当地总人口20多万，其中有来自温州的华人就有3万多。
In January 2013, a fire broke out at a Chinese clothing factory in Prato, just before dawn, when most people were still asleep. The factory was flooded with fabric, the fire ignited the plant for nearly four hours, and smoke obscured the sun. Prato is one of Italy's textile centres.
大火夺走了7人生命，灾难发生后，当地警察以安全原因查封了部分工厂。
The fire killed seven people, and after the disaster, local police shut down some factories for safety reasons.
又接连爆出非法移民丑闻，一些华人用旅游签证入境实则打黑工。
A spate of illegal immigration scandals has erupted, with some Chinese using tourist visas to enter the country illegally.
大火立即引爆了意大利社会的舆论，在对死者表达惋惜的同时，也纷纷谴责华人企业主无视消防安全。
The fire immediately set off public opinion in Italy, deploring the dead and blaming Chinese business owners for ignoring fire safety.
意大利底层民众则更为激进，他们认为是非法居留的华人抢占了他们的就业机会，于是一轮排华风潮开始了，部分华人商店遭到攻击，整个意大利华人社群陷入人人自危的境地。
Even more radical are Italy's underclass, who believe that illegal Chinese are taking their jobs, leading to a wave of Chinese expulsions, attacks on some Chinese shops, and a general sense of insecurity for the entire Italian Chinese community.
看着这一切发生的石洋石没有袖手旁观，他明白自己作为一个华人演员的特殊使命，“不仅要诠释好每一个角色，还要为意大利的华人发声。
Watching all this happen without looking on, he realized his special mission as a Chinese actor, "not only to interpret every role, but also to make a voice for the Chinese in Italy.
“他说，“要在中国和意大利之间，创造出只有这两种文化碰撞才能产生的东西。
"To create something between China and Italy that only the collision of the two cultures can produce," he said.
”他用了“碰撞”一词，这是出于两个相互不了解的文化产生的对峙。
He used the word "collision," a stand-off between two cultures that did not understand each other.
意大利和中国尽管有着悠久历史，上一次友好交流还是在马可波罗时代，中国已经打开国门三十年，“然而在人的内心中还有一道看不见的门，阻隔相互了解。
Although Italy and China have a long history, the last time of friendly exchanges was in the Marco Polo era, China has been opening its doors for 30 years.
”他说。
'he said.
他把几名遇难工人的经历编排成话剧，不但展现了他们的人生轨迹，还有工人身后心态各异的家庭，他相信，“无论中国人还是意大利人，东方人还是西方人，对美好生活的向往是相似的。
He chronicled the lives of several of the workers, showing their lives and families behind them, believing that "Chinese and Italians, Easterners and Westerners alike want a better life.
”他还与朋友在普拉托发起“百面墙”活动。
"He and his friends also launched the" 100-facade "campaign in Prato.
选取100张照片，每张照片上有一个意大利人和一个在普拉托生活的移民，照片上两个人在一起工作、生活、谈恋爱，借此唤起大众对于移民的关注和了解。
Select 100 photos, each of which shows an Italian and an immigrant living in Prato, showing two people working, living and dating together to raise awareness and understanding of immigrants.
另一个少数石阳石1979年出生在济南，回忆起童年生活，他还能清楚记得儿时生活轨迹的细节，“（就我读的）省立医院幼儿园，纬九路小学，省立医院老院址南门那儿有一棵高耸的参天大树。
Another minority, born in 1979 in Jinan, recalled his childhood life and remembered the details of his childhood trajectory. "(As far as I am concerned) Provincial Hospital Kindergarten, Zhoujiu Primary School, and Provincial Hospital has a towering towering tree near the south gate of the old courtyard.
”他印象最深的是一家人在奶奶家包水饺。
"What impressed him most was the fact that the family was making dumplings.
“奶奶家住在五院附近，每个周日我和妈妈都从六里山骑着自行车去奶奶家，奶奶负责调馅儿，其他人分工合作，我的工作就是‘按剂子’。
"Grandma's house lived near the Fifth House. Every Sunday my mother and I rode bicycles from Liuli Mountain to Grandma's house.
”他有着一个山东人的典型性格，耿直、敢闯。
"He had a typical Shandong personality, and he was straightforward and aggressive.
但在内心里，有一个东西他困惑了七年之久，要不要告诉父母，自己是一个同志？自从了解到自己的性取向起，他就陷入了长时间的纠结。
But in his heart, there's something he's been puzzling for seven years about telling his parents that he's gay? He's been stuck in a long row since he learned about his sexual orientation.
“问过自己无数次，对我来说这可能只是关于自己的一件事，但会不会引起担忧或困扰，特别是我的父母和家人。
"I've asked myself countless times that it might be about me, but it's not something that worries or bothers me, especially my parents and family.
”在济南这个保守文化为主流的社会里，无后，意味着家丑外扬。
"In Jinan, where conservative culture is the dominant culture, having no afterthought means that the family is ugly.
如果在中国完成自我认同的过程，这对他而言将是无比痛苦的，他又庆幸自己，“就像我认识的许多中国人一样，我应该逃跑。
It would be painful for him to complete the process of self-identification in China, he said, congratulating himself, "Like many Chinese I know, I should run away.
”但意大利当时的情况也好不到哪里去，作为天主教文明的中心，意大利LGBT权利的进步一直落后于西欧。
But Italy was no better off at the time, with advances in LGBT rights in Italy, the centre of Catholic civilization, lagging behind those in Western Europe.
直到2016年意大利议会才通过法律允许同性伴侣之间的民事结合，但对收养子女只字未提。
It was not until 2016 that the Italian Parliament passed a law allowing civil unions between same-sex couples, but said nothing about the adoption of children.
在他出柜后接受记者采访时，他说：“在意大利做一个同志比在中国做一个同志更加困难。
"Being a gay man in Italy is more difficult than being a gay man in China," he said in an interview after his arrival.
”是父亲帮助他从纠结中走了出来。
"It was his father who helped him get out of the mess.
“他是一个非常乐观的人，就像一个纯种的西西里人。
"He is a very optimistic man, like a pure Sicilian.
”在忐忑不安中向他出柜时，父亲并未有中国传统家庭“天崩地裂”的感觉，石阳石觉得，正是早年在意大利打拼的经历，使得一家人可以轻易理解对方。
When he came out of the cupboard in trepidation, his father didn't feel like the traditional Chinese family had collapsed, and Shi felt it was his early experience in Italy that made it easy for the family to understand each other.
在与男友交往后，石阳石开始关注LGBT议题，比如在中文的YouTube频道以及在各种电视节目中，都有不少通过好玩的方式讲述同性恋的视频。
After dating her boyfriend, Shi has focused on LGBT issues, including YouTube in Chinese and videos on various TV shows featuring gay people in fun ways.
他在自己的表演中也加入同志角色，尤其是华人同志角色，在意大利度过了近三十年岁月，经历了许多不同的身份后，“我想成为一个能够演出很多关于我们角色的演员，包括那些我们曾经刻意隐藏的角色。
He added gay characters, especially Chinese ones, to his performances. After nearly 30 years in Italy and many different identities, "I want to be an actor who can perform a lot about our characters, including those we used to hide.
”石阳石与男友文化调解人不论意大利还是中国之间的，抑或是直人与性少数群体之间的，他明白，相互不了解才会产生对峙。
Whether it's between Italy and China, or between straight people and sexual minorities, Mr Shi knows that a stand-off comes from not knowing each other.
2015年他主演的话剧公演了，在这部话剧取材于自己家族五代人从晚清至1990年代近一百年的中国历史，他用自己家族的几个人物串联起来：裹小脚的童养媳太姥姥，在协和医院学医却在“文革”中备受屈辱的姥爷，以及被时代裹挟的“红卫兵”父亲。
The show, which starred him in 2015, is based on the nearly 100-year-old Chinese history of his family from the late Qing Dynasty to the late 1990s, tying together several figures from his own family: the little-footed child bride-in-law, the humiliated grandpa studying medicine at Concorde Hospital during the Cultural Revolution, and the erstwhile father of the Red Guards.
一个半小时的演出里，他同时用汉语和意大利语表演，是移民的身份给了他启发，“很多不同的概念在我的脑子里翻跟头，移民的生活不止有奋斗，也有一切生活里的酸甜苦辣，（演出）让意大利人觉得，我在沙滩上卖伞也是一件很好的事情，一边卖伞一边在传播中国文化啊。
He performed in both Chinese and Italian for an hour and a half, inspired by his status as an immigrant. "There are many different concepts in my mind, the life of immigrants is not only a struggle, but all the joys and sorrows of life.
”他说，“通过我的表演，可以给底层人以默默无闻的尊严。
'he said.' Through my performances, I can give the lowly a little dignity.
”在他以前，还没有意大利的话剧，“用这样一种方式去把他们自己的生活呈现出来。
Before him, there had been no Italian drama, "to present their lives in such a way.
”他的突破也为自己赢得了掌声，当年的米兰世博会，他被邀请作为表演嘉宾，一个华人在白人统治的意大利话剧界算是火了。
His breakthrough won him applause, too, when he was invited as a guest performer at the World Expo in Milan, where a Chinese was a hit in the white-dominated Italian theater.
除了话剧，他还参与到了其它领域。
In addition to the play, he was involved in other fields.
他参演了一系列电视剧和电影的表演。
He took part in a series of TV plays and movies.
2019年，他参演的电影《多米诺效应》入围第76届威尼斯影展。
In 2019, his film Domino Effect was shortlisted for the 76th Venice Film Festival.
同时他还是意大利各种脱口秀节目的嘉宾。
He was also featured on various Italian talk shows.
他始终热爱自己的角色，“我愿意为他们发声。
He's always loved his part. "I'm willing to speak up for them.
”新冠疫情在意大利爆发之后，当地又出现了新一轮的歧视风潮。
The outbreak of the new crown in Italy was followed by a new wave of discrimination.
华人走在马路上会被指着骂“病毒”。
Chinese walk on the road will be pointed at the "virus."
一家意大利电视台竟公然说“这种病毒会在中国大肆感染，是因为他们的医疗不先进”。
An Italian television station openly said that "the virus will infect China because their medical care is not advanced."
石阳石又“坐不住了”，他开始去多个电视节目分享意见和建议。
Shiyang Shi also "can not sit down", he began to go to a number of television programmes to share ideas and suggestions.
他曾经去过武汉，当时是为了拍电影《消失的星星》，给意大利导演简尼-阿迈里奥当导演助理。
He had been to Wuhan, where he was helping Italian director Gianni Amelio make the movie "The Lost Star."
主持人问他，我们听说这几天有一些关于中国公民在意大利不愉快的事情发生了。
The host asked him what we had heard about Chinese citizens being unhappy in Italy these days.
他说，不是“不愉快”，是“危险”的事情发生了。
It wasn't "unpleasant," he said. "It was a" dangerous "thing.
无论受害者是罗马尼亚移民或巴西移民还是我们华侨，甚至是意大利南方所谓“老土”（terroni），简单用“不愉快”两字是不对的。
Whether the victims are Romanian or Brazilian immigrants or we Chinese, or even the so-called terroni in southern Italy, simply using the word "unhappy" is wrong.
所谓“种族歧视病毒”应该在它还没有爆发的时候及时阻止住。
The so-called "racial discrimination virus" should be stopped before it breaks out.
他继续补充，我们意大利公民应该本着理性对待的精神去建设两国关系。
He added that we Italian citizens should approach our relations in a spirit of reason.
你可以从意大利的角度去批评中国，哪怕批评政府，但是目的一定要清晰，因为最终目的应该是共赢，而不是自残或双败。
You can criticize China from the Italian perspective, even if it is critical of the government, but the aim must be clear, because the ultimate goal should be win-win, not self-harm or double defeat.
从最初只能夸张表演才能进入主流视野，到如今成为一个多层次的公众人物，石洋石认为，一个人只要不局限于自己的身份，他可以做的事情还能有很多。
From exaggerating acting to being a mainstream figure at first, to being a multilevel public figure today, Stone argues that a person can do a lot more than his own identity.
