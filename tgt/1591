在史晋川看来，政府包飞机、包高铁、派专车去接农民工，可以在短期内缓解企业的用工压力。
In Mr Shi's view, government-chartered aircraft, high-speed rail and special cars to pick up migrant workers could ease the pressure on companies to employ workers in the short term.
“但要想从根本上解决用工问题，要深化配套的社会改革，让农民工也享受到当地经济发展的同等好处和权益。
"But to fundamentally solve the problem of employment, we need to deepen supporting social reforms so that migrant workers can enjoy the same benefits and rights as local economic development.
”全文5412字，阅读约需10分钟抗击疫情的斗争仍在继续，经济活动的恢复在有序推进。
Reading the full 5,412 words, it will take about 10 minutes for the battle against the epidemic to continue and the resumption of economic activity proceeds in an orderly fashion.
但受制于人员不齐、产业链不顺畅，一些企业的生产尚未恢复到疫情前的状态。
However, due to irregular personnel, the industrial chain is not smooth, some enterprises production has not returned to the pre-epidemic state.
近期，浙江省多个地方政府采取“包飞机、包高铁、包车”等硬核方法，帮助企业接回外地员工。
Recently, several local governments in Zhejiang Province have adopted hard-core methods such as "charter aircraft, high-speed rail bags and charters" to help companies bring back non-resident workers.
“浙江地方政府硬核做法背后是，这些地区近年来面临着招工难、用工荒的问题，这些做法可以说是当地政府的‘自救’。
"Behind the hard core practices of local governments in Zhejiang, these areas have in recent years faced problems of recruitment and shortage of workers, which can be said to be" self-help "by the local government.
”浙江大学民营经济研究中心主任史晋川说。
Shi Jinchuan, director of Zhejiang University's Center for Private Economics.
在浙江其他地区陆续复工的热潮中，作为湖北以外疫情最严重的区域之一，温州的复工时间一再推迟。
The resumption of work in Wenzhou, one of the worst affected areas outside Hubei province, has been postponed repeatedly in the rush to resume work in other areas of Zhejiang Province.
“和浙江这些硬核复工的地方政府一样，近些年来温州打工的人员数量在不断下滑，温州开工时间一再的延迟会加剧劳动力的流出，未来务工人员可能会更加紧缺。
"Like local governments in Zhejiang, where hard-core workers have returned to work, the number of people working in Wenzhou has been declining in recent years, and repeated delays in the start of construction in Wenzhou will exacerbate the outflow of laborers, who are likely to become more scarce in the future.
”不少温州当地的制造业企业主担忧。
Many local manufacturers in Wenzhou are worried.
除了人员，产业链不顺畅是当前企业复工的另一大难题。
In addition to the personnel, the industrial chain is not smooth is the current business resumption of another major problem.
“每个产业都是由一个环环相扣企业群体组成的长链条，只要链条中一个环节的企业群体停止运行，整个产业链就无法有序运转。
"Every industry is a long chain of interlocking groups of enterprises, and as long as one link in the chain stops functioning, the whole chain cannot function in an orderly manner."
”何路（化名）是某大型石化集团一部门的负责人，他所在的石化行业都是长年连续生产，但受疫情影响，下游大多数企业仍处于停工状态，这导致了大量石化产品全面爆仓，石化企业被迫降低生产负荷。
He Lu (not his real name) is the head of a large petrochemical group whose petrochemical industry has been in continuous production for years, but most of the downstream companies are still out of business because of the epidemic, which has led to a massive explosion of petrochemical products and forced petrochemical companies to reduce production loads.
汽车企业同样面临着产业链未能全面复工的困境。
Automobile enterprises are also faced with the failure of the industrial chain to return to work.
“上游零部件供应商不复工的话，我们就没法全面复工。
"We won't be able to get back to work fully until the upstream suppliers get back to work.
只能向紧缺的零部件供应商提供防疫物资，帮助它们复工，从而恢复我们的部分生产线。
We have been able to rehabilitate some of our production lines only by supplying epidemic prevention materials to short supply parts suppliers to help them get back to work.
”国内某大型车企正在酝酿自己投产防疫物资的生产线，给自家企业和更多的供应商解决防疫物资短缺的问题。
"A large domestic auto maker is brewing its own production line for epidemic prevention supplies to solve the problem of shortages for its own enterprises and more suppliers.
对此，专家呼吁，要衔接好防疫和复工，尽早恢复物流、人员流动和生产活动。
In this regard, experts called for a good connection between immunization and resumption of work, logistics, mobility and production activities as soon as possible.

同一天，湖州市政府出台文件：设立不少于1亿元的企业复工复产补助奖励资金，专项用于企业复工复产；对企业新招员工，给予1000元/人的一次性生活补助；由企业统一组织市外员工包车返回的，包车费用由政府全额补贴等。
On the same day, the government of Huzhou issued documents: setting up an incentive fund of no less than 100 million yuan to encourage enterprises to resume production, and granting them a one-time living allowance of 1,000 yuan per person for newly recruited employees.

Zhejiang Tian Neng Power Energy Co. Ltd. is located in Changxing County, Huzhou City, to manufacture electric vehicles environment-friendly battery-based industry.
公司有1800多外地员工，多来自云南、贵州、河南、四川、安徽等劳动力大省。
The company has more than 1800 foreign workers, mostly from Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, Sichuan, Anhui and other labor force provinces.
按照公司的放假安排，1月30日（农历正月初六）公司全员返岗。
According to the company's holiday arrangements, January 30 (the sixth day of the first month of the lunar calendar) the company's full staff back.
“疫情突然发生，很多地方封村封路，很多云贵川的员工回不来，肯定无法全员返岗了。
"The outbreak of the outbreak, many places closed the village, many Yun Guichuan staff can not return to work, certainly can not return to full-time.
”天能总经理助理许月刚说，公司作为劳动力密集型的制造业企业，员工能否全员返岗尤为重要。
Xu Yuegang, assistant general manager, said it was particularly important for the company, a labour-intensive manufacturing company, to have all its employees back on duty.
2月9日，天能向长兴县政府提出车接员工的申请，长兴县交通运输局主动对接企业，2月11日成功办理浙江省首张政府指定性员工返岗包车通行证。
On February 9, the day before the Changxing County government to apply for car employees, Changxing County Transport Bureau took the initiative to docking enterprises, February 11, the first government-designated staff members in Zhejiang Province to return to work on the charter car pass.
“在政府帮我们派遣专车时，公司防疫指挥中心也主动和云南省德宏州防疫指挥中心取得联系。
"When the government sent us a special bus, the company's epidemic prevention command center also took the initiative to contact Dehong state epidemic prevention command center in Yunnan Province.
对方一个副组长在听到我们的请求后，第一时间帮助我们开通省市县外来车辆专线绿灯，将我们的大巴车调度到员工指定上车地点。
Upon hearing our request, one of the vice-chairmen of the other party immediately helped us to open the green light of the special traffic lines in the provinces and cities, dispatching our buses to the designated places of the employees.
”当地政府的帮助让许月刚尤为感动。
Xu Yuegang was particularly moved by the help of the local government.
员工强烈返工的意愿也让许月刚感慨万千。
Staff strong rework of the will to let Xu Yueh-kwang just moved.
“我们有员工在云南深山里，当地封路封村，他们完全可以以交通堵塞为由不返工，但员工硬是徒步60里山路走到县城大巴车的停靠地点，到达时已是夜里。
"We have people in the deep mountains of Yunnan who have blocked roads and villages, and they can simply not go back to work because of traffic jams, but the staff walked 60 miles to the stop point of the county bus.
”2月14日、15日，载着300多位员工的大巴到达天能的工厂。
On February 14 and 15, a bus carrying more than 300 employees arrived at Danone's factory.
“我们第二批8辆车也陆续要出发，接回云南、贵州两地的员工。
"Our second batch of eight cars will also start to take back the staff of Yunnan and Guizhou.
”许月刚说，在接回外地员工前，长兴县还给企业调配了大量的医疗物资，帮助企业做好开工后的防疫。
Xu Yuegang said Changxing county had also deployed a large amount of medical supplies to enterprises before accepting back non-resident workers to help them prepare for epidemic prevention after construction.
“我们公司自己也做了防疫工作的准备，目前公司90%的生产线已经动起来了。
"Our company has made preparations for epidemic prevention itself. At present, 90 percent of the company's production lines have been activated.
”浙江当地学者、浙江大学民营经济研究中心主任史晋川对当地政府帮助企业硬核复工的做法并不意外。
Shi Jinchuan, a local scholar in Zhejiang University and director of Zhejiang University's private-sector economic research centre, wasn't surprised local authorities helped companies get back to work.
“政企合力留住劳动力，当地政府的做法值得提倡。
"Governments and companies are working together to retain the workforce, and local government practices are worth promoting.
浙江地方政府硬核做法背后是，近年来这些地区面临着招工难、用工荒的问题，这些做法也可以说是当地政府的‘自救’。
Behind the hard core practices of local governments in Zhejiang are problems of recruitment and shortage of workers in these areas in recent years, which can also be described as "self-help" by local governments.
”史晋川指出，2008年之后，浙江多个传统制造业地区招工难问题凸显。
"After 2008, recruitment problems in several traditional manufacturing areas in Zhejiang have come to the fore, according to Mr Shi.
“2008年，新出台的劳动法加大对工人权益的保护。
"In 2008, the new labor law increased the protection of workers' rights and interests.
与此同时，金融危机爆发，江浙地区制造业转型升级缓慢的弊端就暴露出来了，很多企业盈利不佳，工人的薪资水平自然无法得到大幅度提高。
At the same time, the financial crisis, Jiangsu and Zhejiang manufacturing transformation and upgrade slowly exposed the drawbacks, many enterprises profit badly, workers' wages can not be significantly improved.
”史晋川说，在内外部因素的双重驱动下，浙江多个传统制造业地区的劳动力开始出现明显的外流。
"Driven by both internal and external factors, a marked outflow of labor from many traditional manufacturing areas in Zhejiang began, Shi said.
在史晋川看来，政府包飞机、包高铁、派专车去接农民工，可以在短期内缓解企业的用工压力。
In Mr Shi's view, government-chartered aircraft, high-speed rail and special cars to pick up migrant workers could ease the pressure on companies to employ workers in the short term.
“但要想从根本上解决用工问题，要深化配套的社会改革，让农民工也享受到当地经济发展的同等好处和权益。
"But to fundamentally solve the problem of employment, we need to deepen supporting social reforms so that migrant workers can enjoy the same benefits and rights as local economic development.
”━━━━━样本2：用工荒遇到疫情 温州企业担忧招工难加剧在浙江其他地区陆续复工的热潮中，作为湖北以外疫情最严重的区域之一，疫情形势的严峻使得温州企业复工一再推迟。
Sample 2: Job Scarcity Encountered by the Outbreak Enterprise of Wenzhou Worried about the difficulty of finding jobs in other areas of Zhejiang Province resumed work. As one of the worst affected areas outside Hubei, the severity of the epidemic situation has caused Wenzhou enterprises to resume work again and again.
“原来政府说开工不能早于正月十五，后来一再延迟，目前的要求是大部分企业开工日期不得早于2月18日。
"The original government said the construction could not start earlier than the 15th of the first month, but was delayed again and again. The current requirement is that most businesses start no earlier than February 18.
”德首控股集团有限公司（下简称“德首控股”）董事长虞文辉表示。
Yu Wenhui, chairman of the Holdings Group, said.
2月11日，最新公布的浙江全省的企业复工电力指数是25.97，分地区看，最低的温州是12.25，只有正常水平的1/10。
On Feb. 11, the newly released Zhejiang Province's return-to-work electric power index was 25.97, the lowest in Wenzhou was 12.25, only one-tenth of the normal level.
也就是说，目前温州企业复工复产情况还处于维持社会生活最基本需求的状态。
In other words, Wenzhou enterprises are still in the state of maintaining the most basic needs of social life.
虞文辉的企业位于温州下辖的乐清市，疫情之下，公司业绩受影响明显。
Yu Wenhui's enterprise is located in the city of Yueqing, which is under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou.
“我们公司专业生产冷热水用PP-R管材管件、排水用PVC-U管材管件等建筑水电产品。
"Our company specializes in the production of cold and hot water PP-R pipe fittings, drainage PVC-U pipe fittings and other construction hydropower products.
往年春节后，建筑项目开始施工，作为建筑行业用品的供应商，春节前后是我们公司销售的旺季。
After the Spring Festival of previous years, construction projects began, as a supplier of construction supplies, Spring Festival is our company sales peak season.
但受疫情影响，建筑行业基本暂缓开工，我们也受拖累。
But affected by the epidemic, the construction industry basically suspended construction, we also suffered a drag.
”虞文辉说。
"said Yu.
但虞文辉更担心的是公司员工的流失。
But Yu is more worried about the loss of his staff.
“温州属于疫情重灾区，开工时间一再拖延。
"Wenzhou is a disaster area of the epidemic, construction time repeatedly delayed.
考虑到安全状况以及开工日期，可能会促使部分选择留在老家或者到疫情不太严重的地区就业。
Given the security situation and the start date, it may be possible to encourage some to stay at home or to seek employment in areas where the epidemic is less severe.
”虞文辉说，目前公司有员工120人，来自湖北、贵州、四川、安徽等劳动力输出大省。
Yu said his company currently employs 120 people from Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan and Anhui provinces, where most of the workforce is exported.
在虞文辉看来，温州地区疫情结束后，或将面临严峻的招工压力。
In Yu Wenhui's view, Wenzhou after the end of the epidemic, or will face severe recruitment pressure.
“一方面，温州有33万来自湖北的人员，预计今年上半年这33万人全部到岗的难度非常大，尤其是制造业企业的生产线在上半年会面临很大的压力。
"On the one hand, there are 330,000 people in Wenzhou from Hubei Province, and it is expected that all 330,000 of them will arrive in the first half of this year.
另一方面，和浙江一些硬核做法的地区一样，近年来来温州打工的人员数量在不断下滑，此次疫情会加剧劳动力的流出，未来务工人员可能会更加紧缺。
On the other hand, as in some hard-core areas of Zhejiang, the number of people who have come to Wenzhou has been declining in recent years, and the epidemic is likely to exacerbate the outflow of labor and future labor shortages.
”虞文辉说。
"said Yu.
2008年金融危机以来，温州“招工难”、“用工荒”等问题在每年年后不时见诸报端。
Since the 2008 financial crisis, Wenzhou "recruitment difficulties," "labor shortage" and other issues in the annual post-annual press.
据温州晚报2018年3月的报道，温州市人力社保局选取了市内各行业200家企业样本(其中大型企业21家，中型企业56家，小微123家)和200名劳动者就企业用工情况、工资待遇水平、劳动者年龄结构等9大项38小项进行问卷调查、实地走访。
Wenzhou Evening News reported in March 2018 that the Wenzhou Bureau of Manpower and Social Security selected a sample of 200 enterprises (21 large, 56 medium and 123 small) and 200 workers in the city to conduct a questionnaire survey and field visits on 9 major sub-items, such as employment status, wage and salary levels and age structure of workers.
调查显示，样本企业中均存在不同程度的“招工难”问题，其中，我市劳动密集型企业一线普工最为紧缺，普工缺口占缺工总数的58.4%，同比增长3.13%。
The survey showed that all the enterprises in the sample had different degrees of difficulty in finding jobs. Among them, the first-line workers in our city are in most short supply, accounting for 58.4% of the total number of jobs, an increase of 3.13%.

━━━━━样本3：石化企业复工困境：产业全链条难以全部启动除了受制于人员，产业链不顺畅也是多个企业复工面临的另一大问题。
Sample 3: Returning to the Dilemma of Petrochemical Enterprises: Difficulty in Starting Up the Whole Industrial Chain Apart from being restricted by personnel, the lack of a smooth industrial chain is another big problem for many enterprises to resume working.
2月14日，海天石化集团的生产线开始复工。
On 14 February, the production line of Haitian Petrochemical Group resumed work.
海天石化集团成立于2000年，为国家级高新技术企业，主营石化、能源、新材料等业务，公司生产的产品聚丙烯是塑料制品的主要原料。
Founded in 2000, Haitianhua Group is a high-tech enterprise at the national level, specializing in petrochemical, energy and new materials.
“我们的原料供应商一再给我们打电话，要求我们一定要恢复生产，否则他们的机器被憋停后，后果不堪设想。
"Our suppliers of raw materials have repeatedly called us and asked us to resume production, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous if their machines were shut down.
”海天石化集团总经理谢飞说，再三催促他的供应商是某大型石化集团，该公司生产的石油是聚丙烯产品的主要原料。
Xie Fei, general manager of Haitianhua Group, said he had repeatedly urged his supplier, a large petrochemical group, that the oil it produced was the main raw material for polypropylene products.
为何石化集团再三催促下游企业开工？“石化行业特点是连续生产不能停，除了三年一小修、四年一大修，全厂的机器才会停下来。
Why did Petrochemical Group repeatedly urge downstream companies to start work? "Petrochemical industry is characterized by continuous production can not stop, except for three years of minor repairs, four years of major repairs, the entire plant machine will stop.
除此之外，一年365天、每天24小时连续生产。
This is in addition to 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
一旦突然停下生产，会给公司带来巨大的损失。
It will bring great loss to the company once the production stops suddenly.
”上述大型石化集团一部门负责人何路说，在往年春节期间，公司生产的聚丙烯原料放置在前沿仓库，待下游企业春节后开工时，再向下游企业供货。
He Lu, head of one of the group's largest petrochemical groups, said that during the Spring Festival in previous years, the company's polypropylene raw materials were placed in front warehouses to be supplied to downstream companies when they start work after the Spring Festival.
“按照往年，库存容量足够。
"In previous years, there was sufficient inventory capacity.
但受疫情影响，今年下游企业一再延迟开工，库存无法运送给下游企业，同时生产线还在不断出货，现在已经爆仓了，而且这些液体石化产品不能随意堆放。
But because of the epidemic, downstream companies have repeatedly delayed the start of work this year, stocks cannot be delivered to downstream companies, and production lines continue to be shipped and are now out of stock, and the liquid petrochemicals cannot be stacked at will.
”作为下游企业的海天石化集团2月1日停工。
As a downstream company, Haitian Petrochemical Group stopped work on February 1.
谢飞说，“公司生产出来的聚丙烯产品是固体，需要用国外运送来的集装箱装置。
"The polypropylene products produced by the company are solid and require container units to be shipped from abroad," he said.
疫情形势严重后，很多交通线停了，集装箱无法从港口顺利送到工厂。
After the outbreak became severe, many lines of communication stopped and containers could not be delivered from the port to the factory smoothly.
我们生产的产品无法顺利运送给下游客户，产品积压严重，只能停工。
Our products can not be delivered to downstream customers smoothly, the product backlog is serious, can only stop work.
”▲受下游企业未开工的影响，海天石化集团产品积压严重。
Affected by the failure of downstream companies to start work, Haitian Petrochemical Group's product backlog is serious.
2月14日开工的海天石化集团还面临着此前停工时的问题。
The Haitianhua Group, which began work on 14 February, also faces problems with previous work stoppages.
“虽然交通情况在改善中，但省内、省际间的公路铁路运输并未完全恢复，加上宾馆、饭店开业的很少，司机也不愿意跑长途运输，产品积压状态仍高企。
"Although the traffic situation is improving, road and rail transport between provinces is not fully restored, and with few hotels and restaurants open and drivers reluctant to travel long distances, product backlogs remain high.
”谢飞说。
"said Xie.
海天石化集团的产品库存高企背后，更重要的因素是下游企业的复工率不高。
The more important factor behind the high product inventory of Haitian Petrochemical Group is the low return rate of downstream enterprises.
据了解，聚丙烯作为原料，可运用于生产纤维制品、制造管材、汽车、零件、输送管道、水管、饭盒、食品包装等，涉及汽车、建筑、家电等行业。
It is understood that polypropylene as raw materials, can be used in the production of fiber products, tubes, cars, spare parts, pipelines, water pipes, food boxes, food packaging, involving automobiles, construction, household appliances, and other industries.
“生产这些产品的企业多是劳动密集型企业，受交通管制的影响，这些企业的返工率并不高。
"Most of the enterprises that produce these products are labor-intensive and are affected by traffic control, and their rework rate is not high.
加上在今年春节期间汽车销售、建筑开工、家电销售受冲击较大，这些企业的产品没有卖出去，大量积压。
Coupled with this year's Spring Festival car sales, construction work, home appliances sales were more affected, these enterprises did not sell products, a large backlog.
因此，这些下游企业现在的开工意愿并不强，自然无法消耗我们的产品。
Therefore, these downstream enterprises are not willing to start now, naturally unable to consume our products.
”谢飞说。
"said Xie.
在何路看来，和所有产业一样，石化产业链条环环相扣，只要其中一个链条受影响，整个产业链就无法有序运转。
In what way, like all industries, the petrochemical industry chain is linked, as long as one of the chain is affected, the entire industrial chain can not operate in an orderly manner.
“但产业链条最上端的石化企业必须连续生产，而位于下游的不少企业现在处于停工状态，这就导致了各种问题。
"But petrochemical enterprises at the top of the chain must continue to produce, and many enterprises downstream are now out of work, which leads to problems."
”国内石化行业平台龙朴聚烯董事长张文龙呼吁：“目前聚乙烯聚丙烯产品石化库存要将近半年时间才有可能消化完，需要整个行业上下游协同，使得产业链走出困境。
Zhang Wenlong, chairman of Longpu polyene, a platform for the domestic petrochemical industry, called: "Petrochemical stocks of polyethylene polypropylene products will take nearly half a year to digest, requiring the entire industry upstream and downstream coordination, so that the industrial chain out of trouble.
”━━━━━样本4：车企自救：向产业链下游提供防疫物资助复工和石化企业一样，汽车企业的复工也受制于产业链的不顺畅。
Sample 4: Automobile enterprises save themselves: provide epidemic prevention support downstream of the industrial chain As with petrochemical enterprises, the resumption of work of automobile enterprises is also constrained by the lack of smooth industrial chains.
韩声（化名）所在的汽车企业复工时间一再推迟——从最初的2月7日到2月10日，最终在2月14日，公司部分生产线终于复工。
The resumption of work at the company, where Mr. Han works as an alias, was repeatedly delayed -- from February 7 to February 10, and finally on February 14, part of the company's production line was finally back to work.
韩声是国内某知名车企的中层管理人员，在他看来，目前车企复工困难重重。
Han Sheng is the middle management of a well-known Chinese car company, in his view, the current difficulties of the resumption of work.
“虽然各个车企做了很多的复工准备，但是总有众多的制约因素导致复工条件不具备。
"Although the companies have done a lot of preparation for the resumption of work, but there are always a number of constraints resulting in conditions do not exist.
其中，汽车供应链难以全部恢复、防疫物资短缺的问题突出，导致很多车企无法及时复工。
Among them, the automobile supply chain is difficult to restore, epidemic prevention material shortage problem is prominent, resulting in many auto enterprises can not return to work in time.
”汽车供应链难以全部恢复的困境是，汽车行业的产业链条是所有行业中最长的产业。
The dilemma with car supply chains is that they are the longest in any industry.
“比如我们公司生产的乘用车有300多家汽车零件供应商，而公司现在只有部分零部件有库存。
"For example, our company produces more than 300 suppliers of car parts and only some of its parts are now in stock.
如果整个供应链没有全面恢复产能的话，车企即使复工，也不可能推进所有的生产线。
If the entire supply chain does not fully restore capacity, car companies, even if they go back to work, will not be able to advance all production lines.
同时，即使300多家供应商的产能都恢复了，如果物流体系不畅，车企的生产线也不可能全部恢复。
At the same time, even if more than 300 suppliers restore capacity, if the logistics system is not smooth, car-company production lines will not be fully restored.
”韩声说，汽车行业的长链条决定了行业受疫情影响最大，复工最难。
The long chain in the auto industry has determined that the industry is the hardest hit by the epidemic and the hardest to get back to work, he said.
复工后还必须做好疫情的防控，这就需要大量的防疫物资。
After the resumption of work must also do a good job in the prevention and control of the epidemic, which requires a large number of epidemic prevention materials.
“我们公司通过去海外采购、请求各个分公司所在地的地方政府调配等多个方式，来解决复工需要的口罩、防护服等医疗物资。
"Our company has addressed the need for medical masks, protective clothing and other medical supplies through overseas purchases and requests for local government deployment at all branch locations.
”韩声说，目前公司筹措的医疗物资基本上只能解决公司自身的需求。
"At present, the medical supplies raised by the company basically only meet the company's own needs," he said.
“与此同时，我们还必须帮助供应商开工，但无法帮助所有的供应商企业解决防疫物资短缺问题，因此只能向紧缺的零部件供应商提供防疫物资，帮助它们复工，从而使得我们的部分生产线得以恢复。
"At the same time, we have to help our suppliers start work, but we can't help all the suppliers to solve the shortage of epidemic prevention materials, so we have to provide epidemic prevention materials to suppliers of scarce spare parts to help them get back to work, so that some of our production lines can be restored."
”韩声说，为了自救，目前公司正在酝酿投入防疫物资生产线，来给自身和更多的供应商解决防疫物资短缺的问题。
"In order to save itself, the company is brewing a production line for epidemic prevention materials to solve the problem for itself and more suppliers," he said.
实际上，近期上汽通用五菱、比亚迪、广汽等多家车企宣布跨界生产口罩。
In fact, SAIC General Wuling, BYD, Guangqi and other auto companies announced the cross-border production of masks.
一方面，是为了支援抗疫，另一方面，也是在为该企业员工的正常复工做准备。
On the one hand, it is to support the fight against epidemic, on the other hand, it is also preparing for the normal resumption of work of employees of the enterprise.
据韩声介绍，2月14日，公司北京生产基地在复工后生产的第一台汽车已经下线。
According to Han Sheng, on February 14, the company's Beijing production base after the resumption of production of the first car has been off line.
此外，目前合肥、河北、南京等基地的生产线正陆续恢复中，公司有三分之一的生产线开始复工。
In addition, Hefei, Hebei, Nanjing and other production lines are being restored, a third of the company's production lines began to resume work.
但他同时表示，短期内其所在的车企不可能全面的复产。
But he also said that in the short term his car company is unlikely to be able to fully resume production.
“生产线需要的零部件配置短期内不会全部到位，工人也不可能立刻全员返岗。
"The spare parts configuration needed for the production line will not be in place in the short term and workers will not be able to return to work immediately.
同时，疫情带来的不确定性，销售端存在诸多不确定性。
At the same time, the uncertainty of the epidemic, there are many uncertainties on the sales side.

━━━━━专家：衔接好防疫和复工 要恢复物流和人员流动除了企业的自救，政府如何帮助企业复工，破解当前企业复工的困境？中国社会科学院世界经济与政治研究所研究员徐奇渊认为，当前交通运输、物流渠道仍面临阻滞，要尽早恢复物流。
2008-12-12 00: 00 (Xu Qiyuan) (World Economic and Political Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) Xu Qiyuan, a researcher at the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, thinks that transportation and logistics channels still face obstacles and should resume logistics as soon as possible.
“目前市场供求矛盾突出、过剩与短缺同时并存。
"The current market is marked by supply and demand contradictions, surplus and shortages coexist.
在此背景下，政策不宜做总量刺激，应以‘疏通’供求关系为主。
In this context, the policy should not do aggregate stimulus, should 'dredge' the relationship between supply and demand.
而打通供求的关键一环，即是物流畅通。
The key link between supply and demand is logistics.
”当前疫情发展尚在发展，有的地区还无法确定具体复工时间，如何在有效防疫和恢复生产之间取得平衡？对此，徐奇渊建议，要恢复人员流动和生产活动。
In response to the ongoing development of the epidemic and the uncertainty in some areas as to the timing of the resumption of work, how can a balance be struck between effective epidemic prevention and resumption of production?
“可以给出一定的技术标准，根据当地新增病例数、人口流动数量、企业防疫情况等，给出明确的、可量化的复工条件，给企业恢复生产提供参考预期。
"Certain technical standards can be given, based on the number of new cases, population movements, epidemic prevention in enterprises, etc., to give clear and quantifiable conditions for the resumption of production in enterprises to provide reference expectations.
在疫情尚未完全解除的情况下，地方政府还应明确复产后的防护措施。
Local governments should also clarify the protective measures for post-partum recovery in the event that the outbreak has not yet been completely eliminated.
在疫情未完全解除的情况下，政府应指导企业对员工进行必要的防护，并为企业提供防护用品充足市场供给。
In the case of incomplete elimination of the epidemic, the Government should guide enterprises in the necessary protection of employees, and provide enterprises with adequate supply of protective equipment market.
