记者/郭慧敏编辑/石爱华宋建华心理咨询师在接听咨询电话截至2月5日上午，全国新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊人数已达23696例，死亡491例，治愈859例。
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia has reached 23,696, 491 deaths and 859 cures nationwide by the morning of February 5.
1月23日，武汉关闭离汉通道后，一条24小时心理咨询热线开通。
On January 23, Wuhan closed the Han corridor, a 24-hour psychological counseling hotline opened.
杜洺君当天接到湖北心理咨询师协会会长电话邀请，成为首批提供咨询服务的心理医师之一。
Du Jun received a telephone invitation from the head of Hubei Psychological Counsellors Association on the same day and became one of the first psychologists to provide consultation services.
热线开通以来，有510人主动寻求心理干预，其中一些缺少医疗资源的人打来电话，希望得到就医帮助，一些出现轻微症状的人变得敏感多疑：门把手，电梯按键，地铁车厢，好像到处都有“敌人”，有人打一个喷嚏就立刻陷入“我是不是感染了”的担忧中，有人每半个小时就要测量一次体温……深一度对话湖北一线心理咨询师杜洺君，他对人们如何调节情绪给出建议。
Since the hotline opened, 510 people have voluntarily sought psychological intervention, some of whom lack the medical resources to seek medical help. Some people with mild symptoms have become suspicious: doorknobs, elevator buttons, subway cars, as if "enemies" are everywhere.
“恐慌是会传染的，恐慌本身更容易打倒人”，杜洺君说，疫情期间，出现紧张、焦虑、害怕是正常的表现，有力的社会保障可以减少不安情绪，“你也可以尝试举起右手，化掌为刀，用力往下砍，暗示自己负面情绪到此结束。
'Panic is contagious and panic itself is easier to beat, 'says Mr. Du.' During the epidemic, stress, anxiety and fear are the norm, and strong social protection can reduce anxiety.
”热线实行两级心理干预深一度：心理咨询项目是如何开展的？是哪些人在提供心理服务？杜洺君：就像疫情一样，从零开始。
"The hotline operates two levels of psychological intervention: How is a counseling program conducted? Who provides psychological services? Du Zengjun: Like an epidemic, it starts from scratch.
我们向协会和社会同时发出召集令，收到了来全国各地以及海外共900多位心理医生的响应，目前，项目由202名经过严格筛选的心理咨询师组成。
We raised the alarm for the association and society at the same time, and received responses from more than 900 psychologists from all over the country and abroad. Currently, the project is composed of 202 highly screened counsellors.
我们对报名者进行了审核，入选心理咨询师必须持证上岗，年龄在40岁以上，有200小时以上面对面咨询经验，咨询完成后，咨询师需要撰写心理干预报告。
We vetted the applicants and the counselors must be certified to work, be over 40 years of age and have more than 200 hours of face-to-face counselling experience.
每晚，我们都会请专业医生，针对新型冠状病毒的医疗常识和政策进行培训。
Every night, we have medical professionals to train them on the new coronavirus medical knowledge and policy.
深一度：心理干预具体流程是怎样的？杜洺君：我们的热线实行两级工作制，首先要对来电的咨询对象进行一级干预，由资深的心理咨询师在前端做接线员，进行五至十分钟的情绪疏导，如果咨询师发现对方不止有情绪问题，还可能存在累积的心理问题，那么就由分发组对来电进行分发和转接，这就进入了二级干预的流程，由另一位咨询师对其进行半小时左右的疏导，或者时间会更长。
First, the senior counselor acts as a receptionist at the front end. If the counselor finds that the other person has not only emotional problems, but also has accumulated psychological problems, then the distribution team distributes and switches the calls to the secondary intervention process, where another consultant directs them for about half an hour or longer.
心理医师记录咨询者情况，一些没有武汉接触史、无症状的人也出现焦虑情绪每半个小时测一次体温深一度：来咨询的，是哪类人群？杜洺君：来咨询的人分两大类。
The psychiatrist records the consultants, and asymptomatic people who have no Wuhan contact history also show anxiety and take a temperature test once every half an hour: What kind of people do you come to consult? Du Zhoujun: There are two main groups of people who come to consult.
一是寻求就医帮助的人，他们常会说：“打不通其他电话只能打你们这个。
First, people who seek medical help often say, "I can't get through to you.
”碰到这种情况我们一般会转接110、120或者来电所在区域的相关负责机构，通过热线帮他们实现和政府的对接。
In such cases, we usually call 110, 120 or the relevant authorities in the area where the call is made to help them connect to the government via a hotline.
另一类是心理上有困惑的人，他们身体上通常会有一点症状，比如感冒、发烧或者咳嗽。
The other is a psychologically confused person who usually has a few physical symptoms, such as a cold, fever or a cough.
这时候他们会比以往更紧张，来电话就是想知道自己到底是不是纯粹的心理问题，我们称之为“求证”，一旦确认自己只是心理作用，就会接着寻求方法改善，我们称之为“求法”。
They are more nervous than ever, calling to find out if they have a purely psychological problem. We call this "corroboration" and, once we have confirmed that we are only acting psychologically, they will then seek ways to improve it.
深一度：能举个例子吗？杜洺君：之前有个人打来电话，说他经常量体温，每隔半小时或者一小时就要量一次，精神高度紧张。
One degree: Can you give me an exampleDu Zengjun: A man called earlier to say that he always takes his temperature and measures it every half an hour or an hour, which makes him highly nervous.
我们判断这种恐慌是因为他用单一的体温指标，来覆盖自己的判断。
We judge this fear because he uses a single indicator of body temperature to cover his own judgment.
他会不断问：“我体温37.5度，是不是感染了新冠病毒？”我当时给他普及了一些心理健康知识，告诉他所有人在这个情况下，都会出现类似的过度紧张和焦虑，需要冷静，不要用单一的指标来吓自己。
He would keep asking, "Am I getting a new crown virus with a temperature of 37.5 degrees?" I gave him some general mental health information, telling him that all people in this situation experience similar stress and anxiety and need to calm down rather than scare themselves with a single indicator.
深一度：来电人群的地域分布是怎样的？杜洺君：我们有三分之一的电话来自湖北之外的地方。
Once upon a time: What's the geographical distribution of callers? Du Ze Jun: One-third of our calls come from outside Hubei.
他们当地还没有心理咨询热线，他们中的很多人没有过武汉接触史，就是纯粹的恐慌，他们的紧张反映了社会普遍存在的心理状态。
They do not have psychological counseling hotline, many of them have no contact history in Wuhan, is pure panic, their tension reflects the general psychological state of society.
曾经有一个妈妈打电话过来，她看到新闻里一个九个月的孩子感染新型冠状病毒，她很害怕，担心自己三个月的孩子也会被感染。
Once a mother called to see a nine-month-old child on the news infected with the new coronavirus. She was afraid that her three-month-old child would be infected.
我们把这种想法叫做不良的心理暗示，这样的想法引起了更深的恐慌。
We call this a bad mental cue, and the idea is causing a deeper panic.
有人的恐慌来自于实质性的事情，有人的恐慌就如同那位妈妈，来自于恐慌本身，这更容易打倒人。
Some panic comes from the real thing, some people panic like the mother, from the panic itself, which is easier to knock down.
深一度：有疑似或确诊患者过来咨询吗？杜洺君：曾经有一个确诊肺炎的男士打电话过来，他程度比较轻，刚确诊就把自己隔离在乡下的房子里，因为药品和物资都不多，所以打过来倾诉焦虑和担心。
Once upon a time a man diagnosed with pneumonia called and isolated himself in a country house right after being diagnosed with pneumonia, because there was not much medicine and supplies, so he called to talk about his anxiety and worry.
其实他隔离条件很好，有自己独立的房子，在打这个通电话之前，这些客观优势是被他忽略的。
In fact, he is well isolated, has his own independent house, before making this phone call, these objective advantages are ignored by him.
他每天看新闻都会觉得自己好可怜，担心自己病情越来越重，会像每天统计的那些数字一样成为死掉的那个，这就是内在的恐惧本身。
Every day he reads the news and feels sorry for himself, worried that his illness is getting worse and worse, that he will become the one who dies, like the figures that are counted every day, and that is the fear itself.
在陪伴和聆听之后我梳理他的思路，向他提出问题：在现有的条件下你能做点什么让自己平复下来，他思考了一会儿后说了句“我知道了”。
After accompanying and listening, I combed his thoughts and asked him questions: What can you do to calm yourself down under the present conditions? He thought for a moment and then said, "I know."
深一度：有一线医护人员过来咨询吗？杜洺君：比较少，他们的专业素养不允许他们在这个时候过多顾及自己内心的感觉。
Once upon a time: Do frontline health care workers come to consult? Du Zengjun: Less, their professionalism does not allow them to be too concerned about their feelings at this time.
也有很多医院第一时间建立了自己的心理干预和救援热线，我们在线支持好几家医院，他们处理不了的，需要二级干预的都会转到我们这里来。
Many hospitals have first set up their own psychological intervention and rescue hotline, we support several hospitals online, they can not handle, the need for secondary intervention will be transferred to us.
深一度：大家对于疫情的恐惧，是不是也间接说明目前的防控存在一些问题，没能给大家足够的安全感？杜洺君：这个不能直接划等号。
Once upon a time, people's fear of the epidemic does not imply that there are some problems in the current prevention and control, which do not give us enough security?
恐惧情绪肯定来自于现实事件，大家的恐慌一部分来自于当前疫情，还有一部分是个体本身的经历引起的，不能一概而论。
Fear must stem from real events, partly from the current epidemic, and partly from individuals "own experiences, which cannot be generalized.
心理救援是疫情防控的补充。
Psychological assistance is the complement of disease prevention and control.
站在我个人的角度，当然希望政府在医疗等方面救助力度更大一些，对于大多数市民而言，在防控的同时，如果能够保证大家生产和生活的基本需要，人的心里状态自然会平和下来。
From my own point of view, I certainly hope that the government will do more to help people in medical and other fields. For the majority of the public, the state of mind will naturally calm down if we can ensure the basic needs of production and living.
当然，从心理学的角度来说，最好是有一个心理预期，就是告诉大家大概要多久，而且心理预期要适度，不能过短，也不能过长，过短如果达不到会有落差和焦虑，如果过长就会从现在开始又开始焦虑。
Of course, from a psychological point of view, it is best to have a psychological expectation that tells you how long it will take, and that psychological expectations should be moderate, not too short, not too long, too short if not too short and too short.
恐慌本身更容易打倒人深一度：面对疫情，哪些心理应激反应是正常的，哪些是不正常的？杜洺君：紧张，害怕，焦虑都是正常的，而一旦产生自杀倾向或者社会攻击性就属于异常了。
Panic itself is more likely to knock someone down: What psychological stress responses are normal and what are abnormal in the face of an epidemic? Du Zengjun: Stress, fear, anxiety are normal, and when suicidal tendencies or social aggression occur, they are abnormal.
就目前所做工作来谈，求助电话基本都在正常范围内的。
As far as the work done so far is concerned, the calls are basically within the normal range.
深一度：恐慌情绪也会传染吗？杜洺君：会，这就是群体性和社会性特点，即使不用语言表达，通过感觉也完全是可以传递恐慌的。
Once upon a time: Can panic be contagious? Du Zengjun: Yes, this is a group and social characteristic, even if you do not use language, through feelings can be completely transmitted panic.
如果处在恐慌的环境下，需要自我有一个严格的保护机制，包括卫生防护各个方面，也要在内心坚定：至少到目前为止我是健康的。
If you are in a panic environment, you need to have a strong protection system in place, including all aspects of health protection, but also inside: at least so far I am healthy.
深一度：一旦陷入焦虑，普通人应如何调整心态？杜洺君：首先是“少”，即少看手机，少看负面新闻。
Once in a while: Once in anxiety, how should ordinary people adjust their mentality? Du Zengjun: First of all, "less," that is, less mobile phone, less negative news.
因为负面新闻会累积负面感受，这样的感受会给人造成困惑，到一定程度就会影响身体；其次是“多”，可以在现有条件下，在家看书听音乐、打打太极、练练瑜伽，或是进行一些棋牌类活动，以往生活中忽略掉的美好、爱好，都可以在这个时候找回。
Because negative news can accumulate negative feelings, such feelings will lead to confusion, to some extent will affect the body; secondly, "more" can be read at home under the existing conditions, playing tai chi, yoga, or some kind of chess activities, the past life neglected good, hobby, can be retrieved at this time.
深一度：有没有实用的小方法可以缓解情绪？杜洺君：首先推荐腹式呼吸法，除此之外还有一个心理阻断的小技术。
Once upon a time: Are there any practical tips for relieving your moods? Mr. Du: First of all, I recommend abdominal breathing, plus a small technique for psychological block.
当人处在一个极端情绪下，情绪会像一条狗，人会被牵着走，这时是需要喊停的。
When people are in an extreme mood, the mood will be like a dog, people will be led away, it is necessary to stop.
你可以拿出右手，化掌为刀，用力往下“砍”，同时嘴里喊停，把负面的想法停在这里。
You can take out your right hand, turn your palms into knives, chop them down, yell them out and stop thinking negative thoughts here.
深一度：防疫一线的医护人员应怎样调整情绪？杜洺君：医护人员首先要接受，从大的层面到小的层面，大的疫情就在那里，同时你的岗位职责也在那里，接受之后就是面对与解决，扩大到整个疫情来说，我们现在的状态就是在解决，解决以后这一切都会过去的，这叫做放下。
Once upon a time: How should the health care workers adjust their moods? Du: First of all, medical staff should accept that the big epidemic is there, from the big to the small, and your responsibility is there.
然后要做的是转身，才能进入到一个新的周期。
Then what you have to do is turn around and move on to a new cycle.
这是心理学常说的人生循环，碰到任何事情都是这样。
This is what psychology often says about the cycle of life, when it comes to anything.
同时医护人员是需要理解和肯定的，在这个没有硝烟的战争里他们是最伟大也是最艰难的，我在热线里也不能做什么，但是要代表所有的市民和家属向他们表示敬意。
At the same time, health care workers need to understand and affirm that they are the greatest and most difficult in a war without the smoke, and I can do nothing on the hotline, but pay tribute to them on behalf of all citizens and their families.
因为除了职业身份，他们就是一个普通人。
Because apart from their professional status, they are ordinary people.
深一度：有的心理咨询师会因为无法为患者提供实质性帮助而感到无力，对此你怎么看？杜洺君：我们既然是心理咨询师，就做好心理咨询师的事情，各司其职就够了。
What do you think about this: some counselors feel powerless because they can't provide real help to their patients? Du Zhoujun: Since we are psychologists, we should do a good job as counselors.
每个人能力都是有限的，要学会面对自己，清楚自己能做什么，更要明白自己不能做什么，有这个界限才是最好的状态。
Everyone is limited, to learn to face their own, to know what they can do, but also to understand what they can not do, this is the best state.
比如普通民众，好好在家隔离就是贡献了，不要超越自己的界限去做不能做到的事情。
For example, ordinary people, good isolation at home is a contribution, do not go beyond their own boundaries to do not do things.
