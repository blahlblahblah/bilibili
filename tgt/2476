2月19日以来，武汉新增病例在300-500区间出现一个持续10天之久的“拉锯期”，不难想像战况之惨烈。
Wuhan since February 19, the new cases in the 300-500 range of a 10-day "pull-saw period," it is not difficult to imagine the fierce fighting.
但指标显示这种胶着局面将很快结束，进入一马平川阶段文 |《财经》数据研究员 徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心 编辑 | 谢丽容郝洲一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在8万例左右截至2月28日24:00，31个省（自治区、直辖市）和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例79251例，新增病例427例。
But the indicators show that the impasse will soon be over, with Xu Jintu, a Caijing data researcher, and Xu Junzhou, a researcher at Caijing. At 2400 hours on February 28, the country's total number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia totaled 7,9251, with 427 new cases reported by 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
二、新增病例：武汉以外地区全面扫尾，武汉继续平台拉锯图1图2国内武汉以外地区总计新增7例（北京确诊的1例亦出自由24日确诊病例追踪隔离的的178位密切接触者），全面进入零星扫尾阶段。
2007-9-25 21: 48 Wuhan continues to pull saw chart 1 A total of 7 new cases have been added outside Wuhan, China (1 case confirmed in Beijing was also isolated from 178 close contacts on 24-day follow-up) and are in the sporadic finishing stages.
武汉以外地区累计新冠病例总数不会突破31000例。
The total number of new cases outside Wuhan will not exceed 31000 cases.
图3图4 武汉等地新增密切接触者和疑似病例从2月19日以来，武汉阻击战在300例-500例区间出现一个持续10天之久的“拉锯期”，由此不难想像情况之惨烈。
Fig. 3 Wuhan and other places and new close contacts and suspected cases Since February 19, Wuhan blockage in 300-500 cases occurred in a 10-day "pull-saw period," it is not difficult to imagine the fierce situation.
但从同期关键上游数据“密切接触者”和“疑似病例”的流量和存量变动趋势（图4）看，武汉的新增疑似病例已降至114例，将很快结束胶着局面，进入一马平川的阶段。
But judging by the trend in the flow and stock of key upstream data "close contacts" and "suspected cases" over the same period (figure 4), the number of new suspected cases in Wuhan has dropped to 114, which will soon put an end to the stalemate.
小编没什么文化，但还是想发自内心大喊一声：武汉挺住！三、主要上游数据持续全面趋好，说明阻隔措施充分有效全国密切接触者、疑似病例的新增量和存量都在持续明显下降。
Three, the main upstream data continue to improve overall, indicating that the barrier measures fully effective national close contacts, suspected cases of new additions and stocks are continuing to decline significantly.
其中非湖北地区、湖北非武汉地区的新增疑似病例更回落至两位数水平，说明此次疫情的阻隔措施充分有效。
Among them, non-Hubei region, Hubei non-Wuhan area of the new suspected cases fell back to double-digit level, indicating that the barrier measures of the epidemic are fully effective.
四、主要下游数据趋好，说明救治措施不断加强全国现有在治疗人数持续减少，最近一周平均每天减少2500人，不断释放核心医疗资源，为集中力量打好中央领导提出的武汉保卫战创造条件，重要资源不断向武汉调集。
Four, the main downstream data are converging, indicating that treatment measures continue to strengthen the existing number of treatment in the country, an average of 2,500 people a day in the past week, the continuous release of core medical resources, the creation of conditions for concentrating efforts on the defense of Wuhan as proposed by the central government, and the mobilization of important resources to Wuhan.
重症率稳步下降，其中武汉尤其明显。
The rate of serious illness has declined steadily, especially in Wuhan.
治愈率继续以较快速度上升，今明两天将首次跨过50%这个节点。
The cure rate continues to rise at a faster rate, reaching the 50 per cent mark for the first time this year and next.
图5图6总之，大局已定。
Figure 5 Figure 6 Overall, the picture is set.
全国其他地区在保持防控力度、抓紧零星扫尾的同时，都屏住呼吸，期待着武汉保卫战尽早结束其艰难拉锯期。
The rest of the country held their breath as they kept control of the area and held their breath in anticipation of the end of Wuhan's difficult saw-sawing period.
这一天指日可待。
That day is within reach.
为武汉加油！五、海外新增病例加速增长，发现确诊病例国家范围继续扩大，世卫组织将全球疫情风险等级调至“最高”图7.1图7.2小结：国内武汉以外地区新增病例全面趋零，零星病例确诊前多已处在隔离状态，传染病阻隔基本成功。
Five, overseas new cases accelerated growth, found that the national scope of confirmed cases continued to expand, WHO has adjusted the global epidemic risk level to the "highest" figure 7.1 Figure 7.2 Summary: New cases outside Wuhan, China has been more or less isolated before the diagnosis of sporadic cases, infectious disease barrier basically successful.
另一方面，救治能力也在不断增强。
On the other hand, the treatment capacity is also increasing.
武汉有望近日结束艰难拉锯战，海外疫情尚处在早期发展阶段。
Wuhan is expected to end the difficult tug-of-war, the overseas epidemic is still in the early stages of development.
