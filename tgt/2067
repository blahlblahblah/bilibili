“若不能有效阻断社区传播，大邱疫情很可能扩散至全国”2月24日，首尔市举行紧急会议，称将采取“先发制人”的措施遏制疫情，包括设立24小时运行的筛查中心，让医护人员在此检测疑似病例。

中新社发 首尔市政府供图 摄2月25日下午4时许，韩国政府中央灾难安全对策本部公布了新冠病毒最新确诊人数，累计确诊新冠病毒患者已达977例，其中与“新天地教会”大邱教会有关的确诊病例为545例，占确诊总数的56%。
By 4: 00 p.m. on Feb. 25, the Central Government's Central Disaster Security Response Headquarters announced the latest confirmed cases of the new crown virus, with a cumulative total of 977 cases, of which 545, or 56 per cent, were related to the Daegu Church of Xintiandi Church.
“‘新天地教会’教徒集体感染新冠病毒事件发生前后的情况截然不同。
"The situation before and after the New World Church's collective infection with the new crown virus is very different.
”韩国总统文在寅在2月23日的青瓦台工作会议上表示。
"South Korean President Wen Jiabao told a working meeting in Qingwadai on February 23.
1月20日出现首个确诊病例后，韩国的新冠病毒疫情一度较为稳定，至2月18日“新天地教会”出现首例病患时，共31人确诊。
After the first confirmed case on January 20, the outbreak was stable, with 31 people diagnosed on Feb. 18, when the first case appeared in Xintiandi Church.
但随后的一周，因“新天地教会”等聚集性疫情爆发，确诊病例数迅速上升，19日达51人，20日破百，21日超过200人，22日达346人，在23日陡增至602人。
However, the following week, due to the "Xintiandi Church" and other concentrated outbreak, the number of confirmed cases rose rapidly, 19 to 51, 20 break 100, 21 days more than 200, 22 days to 346, 23 days to 602.
同日，韩国政府将新冠病毒疫情预警级别调至最高级别的“严重”级别。
On the same day, the South Korean government raised the alert level for the new crown virus to the highest level of "severity."
韩国中央应急处置本部副本部长金刚立表示，该级别对应的是“全国范围内出现社区传播现象”。
Kim Gang-li, deputy minister of the Central Emergency Management Department, said the level corresponded to "community transmission across the country."
2月25日上午，韩国执政党、政府和总统府青瓦台就当前疫情召开协商会议，决定将大邱划为特别管控区，采取超强“封锁措施”力阻疫情蔓延。
On the morning of February 25, the ruling party, the government and the presidential palace in Qingwadai held a consultative meeting on the current epidemic.
不过，青瓦台发言人康珉硕随后对媒体表示，目前的“封锁措施”并不是“武汉式防疫”，仅指尽快寻找并隔离接触病例的人员，阻断疫情扩散及社区传播，并不是禁止交通出入。
However, Qingwadai spokesman Kang min-suo later told the media that the current "blockade measures" are not "Wuhan-style epidemic prevention," only refers to the quickly find and isolate contact with the case of personnel, block the spread of the epidemic and community transmission, is not prohibited traffic.
当天，文在寅访问大邱市，要求动员一切力量，“争取使疫情拐点在本周之内到来”，并指定韩国国务总理丁世均在当地坐镇指挥工作。
Wen visited Daegu on the same day and demanded that all efforts be made to "make the inflection point of the epidemic come within this week," and appointed South Korean State Minister Ding Se-soo to direct the work there.
早被称为“邪教”，但政府难以干预“新天地教会”是导致韩国疫情骤然加重的“罪魁祸首”。
Known as "cults," the government's difficulty in intervening in the Church of the New World was the "culprit" that precipitated the South Korean epidemic.
这个于1984年建立的教会，创建人为现年88岁的韩国人李万熙，总部位于韩国京畿道果川市。
The church, founded in 1984 by Lee Wanxi, an 88-year-old Korean, is headquartered in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.
在教会内，李万熙被称为“应许的牧师”，信徒则称他是耶稣派来见证《新约 启示录》预言成真的随从。
Within the church, Lee was called the Promised Priest, and believers said he was sent by Jesus to witness the prophecy of the New Testament Apocalypse.
“李万熙具有个人魅力和营销技巧。
"Lee has personal charm and marketing skills.
”韩中友城协会会长权起植对《中国新闻周刊》介绍，“他的营销技巧是从普通教会招募追随者。
"His marketing skills are to recruit followers from the general church," Kwon Yoo-cheng, president of the Korean Association of Friends, told China News Weekly.
他派‘间谍’进入正常的教堂，并向教堂的成员进行宣传。
He sent 'spies' into the regular church and publicized it to the members of the church.
”多位韩国民众对《中国新闻周刊》表示，在此之前就听说过这个团体，“是韩国著名的邪教团体，早就被主流媒体揭露过。
Many South Koreans told China News Weekly they had heard of the group "as a well-known cult in South Korea that has long been exposed by mainstream media."
”据《韩国先驱报》报道，早在2007年，韩国文化广播公司（MBC）就曾报道过该团体。
As early as 2007, the Korean Cultural Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) had reported on the group, the South Korean Herald reported.
但是，曾任韩国总统金大中秘书的权起植坦言：“在韩国，因为宗教信仰自由的保护，政府无法干预他们。
But Mr Kwon, a former secretary of South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung, admitted: "In South Korea, the government cannot intervene because of the protection of religious freedom.
”该教会疫情爆发后，韩国总统文在寅也强调，政府介入“新天地教会”涉疫场所管理，是“为确保社区安全采取的不可避免的举措，并非要限制宗教自由”。
In the wake of the outbreak, South Korean President Wen JY also stressed that the government's involvement in the management of the Xintiandi Church's premises was "an inevitable step to ensure community safety and not to restrict religious freedom."
“新天地教会”官网称，其在韩国和全球拥有超过20万信徒，在韩国有1100多个聚会点和附属机构。
The official website of Xintiandi Church says it has more than 200,000 followers in South Korea and around the world, and more than 1,100 meeting places and affiliates in South Korea.
《南华早报》报道称，在人口250万的大邱市，有1.3万人是新天地的信徒，包括2月18日第一位被确诊的61岁感染者。
The South China Morning Post reported that 13,000 people in Taegu, a city with a population of 2.5 million, were adherents of Xintiandi, including the first confirmed 61-year-old on February 18.
这位感染者近期没有海外旅行史，但在出现发热、咳嗽等新冠病毒肺炎症状后，仍于2月9日和16日参加了周日礼拜活动。
The infected man has no recent history of overseas travel, but attended Sunday services on February 9 and 16 after developing symptoms such as fever and cough.
美联社援引一位知情者的话说，在“新天地教会”，参加与教会有关的聚会“不是一种选择，而是一种要求”。
At Xintiandi Church, attending church-related gatherings "is not an option, it's a requirement," the Associated Press quoted a person familiar with the matter as saying.
同期前往该教堂参加活动的还有近1000名来自大邱及庆尚南道、庆尚北道的“新天地教会”信徒，以及6位来自京畿道的信徒。
During the same period, the church was visited by nearly 1,000 people from Daegu and Gyeongsang-Nam provinces, the Church of Xintiandi in Gyeonggi Province, and six from Gyeonggi Province.
一些知情人士描述了聚会的场景。
Some people familiar with the situation described the party.
据《纽约时报》报道，该教会的集会禁止戴眼镜或口罩，信徒们会挤在一起，坐在地板上。
According to The New York Times, the congregation was banned from wearing glasses or masks and believers would huddle together and sit on the floor.
前教会成员称，他们即使生病也会来教堂。
Former church members said they would come to church even if they were sick.
礼拜结束后，他们分成小组学习圣经，或者到街上去传教。
At the end of the service, they study the Bible in small groups or go into the streets to preach.
《韩国先驱报》援引知情人士的消息称，在礼拜仪式上，信徒会大声喊“阿门”，他们的祈祷会涉及身体的亲密接触，比如用手臂抱住下一个人的肩膀。
People familiar with the matter were quoted by the South Korean Herald as saying that during services, believers would shout "amen" and their prayers would involve close physical contact, such as holding one's arm around the next person's shoulder.
疫情发生后，1000多名参加9日、16日礼拜的信徒被隔离在家中。
After the outbreak, more than 1,000 worshippers attending 9 and 16 days of worship were isolated in their homes.
韩国政府对他们和其他数千名相关人员进行了病毒筛查。
The South Korean government screened them and thousands of others for the virus.
三天后，98人被确诊新冠病毒肺炎。
Three days later, 98 people were diagnosed with pneumonia.
一周后，与该教会有关的新冠病毒肺炎患者已超过500人。
A week later, more than 500 people were infected with Newcastle virus pneumonia linked to the church.
拒绝检测、隐瞒名单据韩联社消息，截止2月25日，除确诊病例外，共有约3.6万人接受了韩国政府组织的病毒检测，其中2.2万人的检测结果呈阴性，其余人员的检测结果尚未出炉。
According to the ROK News Agency, as of February 25, in addition to the confirmed cases, about 36,000 people have been tested for the virus, 22,000 of them negative, and the rest have yet to be tested.
韩国疾病控制与预防中心曾指出，“新天地教会”的第一位感染者最初拒绝进行新冠病毒检测。
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted that the first infected person in Xintiandi Church initially refused to be tested for the new crown virus.
“该教会的信徒不害怕疾病，因为他们相信永生。
"The believers in the church are not afraid of disease because they believe in eternal life.
他们相信那些生病和死亡的人最终会死于缺乏信仰。
They believe that those who get sick and die eventually die of lack of faith.
”有知情者对《韩国先驱报》透露。
People familiar with the matter told the South Korean Herald.
不过，“新天地教会”随后发布声明，否认要求信徒拒绝参与检测。
However, the Church of Xintiandi subsequently issued a statement denying that believers were required to refuse to participate in the test.
对此，2月24日，韩国国务总理秘书室等与“新天地教会”进行磋商，要求教会积极配合卫生部门检测工作，鼓励信徒（包括准信徒）接受检测。
On February 24, the secretary-general of the State Council held consultations with the Church of Xintiandi and asked the church to actively cooperate with health sector testing and encourage believers, including would-be believers, to take the test.
。
.
韩国政府还要求“新天地教会”提供各地信徒的名单和联系方式，包括姓名、身份证号码、联系方式和住址。
The government also asked Xintiandi Church to provide the names and contact details of believers everywhere, including names, ID numbers, contact details and addresses.
但是，权起植对《中国新闻周刊》表示：“由于该教会的机密性，他们可能在提交名单时隐藏了一些特殊的信徒，例如政客、娱乐明星、官员等。
However, Kwon told China News Weekly: "Because of the church's confidentiality, they may have hidden special believers such as politicians, entertainers, officials, etc.
”“若不能有效阻断社区传播，大邱疫情很可能扩散至全国。
"Without effective disruption of community transmission, the Daegu epidemic is likely to spread throughout the country.
”韩国中央应急处置本部副本部长金刚立当天表示。
Kim Gang-li, copy minister of the Central Emergency Management Department, said the same day.
鉴于当地医疗资源不足，文在寅2月23日在工作会议中指出，如有必要将争取民间医疗机构和医务人员的合作参与抗疫。
In view of the lack of local medical resources, Wen pointed out at the working meeting on February 23 that if necessary, the cooperation of civil medical institutions and medical personnel should be enlisted to fight the epidemic.
2月25日，韩国中央灾难安全对策本部宣布，韩国政府将对所有“新天地教会”信徒进行病毒检测，并随时公开检测结果。
South Korea's central disaster security headquarters announced on Feb. 25 that the South Korean government will test all Xintiandi Church members for viruses and release test results at any time.
对策本部表示，若教会方面不积极配合政府防疫，将采取法律手段。
The ministry said it would take legal action if the church did not actively cooperate with the government.
此外，对策本部还要求教会先提供今年访问过大邱教会的信徒、访问其他地区的大邱教会信徒等高危人群名单，目前将先对高危信徒进行病毒检测，并致电询问其余信徒是否出现异常症状。
In addition, the Department for Countermeasures requires the Church to provide a list of high-risk groups such as Taegu believers who have visited the Taegu Church this year and those who visit other areas. At-risk believers will now be tested for the virus and called to ask if the rest of the believers have abnormal symptoms.
首次行使“命令休课权”“新天地教会”疫情发生后，韩国政府并未第一时间提高新冠病毒预警级别。
The South Korean government did not immediately raise the alert level of the new crown virus after it first exercised its "command to suspend classes" and "Xintiandi Church" outbreak.
直至2月22日，政府仍然决定继续维持第二高的“警惕”级别。
