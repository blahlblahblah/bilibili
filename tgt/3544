澎湃新闻记者 薛莎莎“那时让人崩溃的往往不是工作带来的劳累，而是我作为医护人员面对病人束手无策。
"It wasn't the strain of work that broke people, it was my helplessness as a healthcare provider," said Xue Sasha, a journalist.
”武汉市中心医院甲状腺乳腺外科护士廖莹岚没法忘记2月初的那个傍晚：一位31岁的男子，用担架车推着他的母亲，一路哭喊着冲进湖北武汉市中心医院发热门诊。
"Liao Ying, a thyroid surgeon at Wuhan Central Hospital, couldn't forget the evening of early February when a 31-year-old man wheeled his mother in a stretcher and rushed into the hot clinic of Wuhan Central Hospital in Hubei Province.
“医生快来救救我妈，我妈快不行了。
"Doctor, come and help my mother. My mother is dying.
”担架上，老人安静地平躺着，没有任何动静。
On the stretcher the old man lay quite still and motionless.
在发热门诊支援的廖莹岚赶紧帮男子把老人推进抢救室，上了仪器后发现，老人早已没有了心跳和呼吸。
In the fever clinic support Liao Ying Lan hastened to help men push the elderly into the rescue room, on the instrument found that the elderly have no heartbeat and breathing.
抢救室外，老人的儿子跪在地上，一边哭一边拍着玻璃墙喊“我妈是为了照顾我才感染的，我好了，她感染了”。
Rescue outside, the old man's son kneels on the ground, crying while patting the glass wall cried "My mother is to take care of me only then infected, I am OK, she infected."
那天下班后，廖莹岚一个人坐在更衣室里哭了很久。
After work that day, Liao Ying Lan sat alone in the locker room and cried for a long time.
在1月下旬至2月中旬的发热门诊，让人悲痛的事几乎每天都在发生。
Tragic events occur almost daily at the febrile outpatient clinic from late January to mid-February.
廖莹岚脑感觉自己陷入了压抑、无力、无助、内疚之中，一度濒临崩溃。
Liao Ying felt that he was trapped in depression, powerlessness, helplessness and guilt and was on the verge of collapse.
这种情绪几乎要拖垮廖莹岚的身体，为在岗位上坚持下去，她只能逼自己“麻木”，借以反思工作得失和经验，做好工作，救更多的人。
This mood almost drags Liao Ying's body, in order to persevere in her post, she can only force herself to "numb", so that she can reflect on her work and experience, do a good job, save more people.
廖莹岚 本文图片均由受访者供图口 述第一周，最大的感受是压抑这些天在发热门诊受到如此多冲击，体验到太多脆弱无助的时刻。
Liao Ying Lan The biggest feeling of this week was that she felt so much shock and vulnerability in the fever clinic these days.
我是1月28日被领导从甲状腺乳腺外科病房派来支援发热门诊的，领导派我来的时候，我就觉得胜任不了这里的工作。
I was sent to the Fever Clinic on January 28th from the Thyroid Surgery Ward. When the leader sent me here, I didn't feel up to it.
但既然来了，就要做好这份工作。
But since I'm here, I have to do the job well.
我负责导诊分诊、给病人输液吸氧、查CT等工作。
I am responsible for the medical treatment of patients, infusion oxygen, check CT and other work.
人手不够，一个人当几个人用。
There's not enough people, just for a few.
来到这里的第一周，最大的感受就是压抑。
The first week I got here, the biggest feeling was depression.
七八十平方米的门诊大厅，只有二三十个座椅，每天接诊的病人有七八百人，人挨人站着、挤着，有经验的病人会搬个小板凳过来排队，每天排队的人都排出大厅数十米远。
There were only twenty or thirty seats in the seventy-eight square meters out-patient hall, and seven or eight hundred patients were being treated every day. People were standing and crowding. Experienced patients would come in a small bench, and queuing up dozens of metres from the hall every day.
病人来到之后先取号，基本要等上四到六个小时才能看诊，看诊后要等同样长的时间去输液。
After the arrival of the patient to take the number, basically waiting for four to six hours to see a doctor, after the same length of time to wait for transfusion.
很多病人凌晨来排队，看诊开药后，去排队输液，基本上到晚上才能离开。
Many patients line up in the early morning to see if they can take their medicine. They line up for an infusion and can't leave until the evening.
有时候第二天来上班，发现前一天的号还有几十个没看完。
Sometimes the next day came to work, found the day before the number of dozens of left over.
1月底2月初的发热门诊病人，排队排出门诊大厅外数十米病人拥挤加上我带着护目镜和面屏，有病人跟我说话，要贴着、靠得很近才能听见。
Fever outpatients in late January and early February, queued up for dozens of meters outside the outpatient department hall plus I wore goggles and a screen, and patients were talking to me, close enough to be heard.
来这里的病人，基本都是新冠肺炎确诊病人，他们普遍非常焦躁、恐慌、担忧。
The patients who came here were mostly patients diagnosed with Newcomial Pneumonia. They were generally very anxious, frightened and worried.
很多病人来了之后会抱怨“为什么这么大的医院只有四位医生看诊，门诊地方这么小，那么多人挤在这里，你这医院怎么开的？像过家家一样。
Many patients come and complain: "Why is it that there are only four doctors in such a big hospital, so few out-patient places and so many people crowded here?
”我们只能向他们一遍一遍解释，不是门诊小，而是病人太多，不是不安排医生坐诊，而是医护人员已经病倒了很多，能来一线的都来了。
We could only explain to them again and again that it was not the small clinic, but the large number of patients, not the absence of a doctor, but the fact that the paramedics had fallen so much that the first line was coming.
病人增加得太快，改造门诊的速度，跟不上病人增加的速度。
The number of patients has increased too fast and the rate of outpatient modifications has not kept pace with the increase in patients.
医护人员基本都没见过这么多的病人，都已忙到快崩溃。
Health care workers have barely seen so many patients and are so busy that they are on the verge of collapse.
“非典”那年，我还在读书，当时想，如果我已经参加工作了，一定要报名去一线，还是学生时，斗志昂扬。
When I was still at school that year, I thought if I had joined the work force, I would have to sign up for the front line, or be a student.
但当我亲身经历，这种场景会一下子让人很有挫败感。
But when I see it for myself, it can be frustrating.
在无力中做最大的努力让人崩溃的往往不是工作带来的劳累，而是我作为医护人员面对病人束手无策。
It's not the strain of work that breaks down when I try my best in my weakness, but the hopelessness of my work as a healthcare provider.
几乎每天都会遇到，被送来的病人呼吸困难、心慌、气喘，这个时候，我只要能给他们一口氧气吸，就能不那么难受，但是我给不了，没有了。
Almost every day, when the patient comes in with breathing difficulties, panic attacks, and wheezing, all I can do is give them oxygen and suck, but I can't give it. No.
病房床位总是处于饱和状态，收不进任何一个新病人，只能等着病房里有人离世或出院，才能进新病人。
The beds in the wards are always saturated, no new patients are admitted, only waiting for someone in the ward to die or leave the hospital room before new patients can be admitted.
对于病情实在严重的病人，只能让他坐在输液室里先吸氧，看到那些奄奄一息的病人吸上氧气后，表情慢慢舒展，身体变得舒服、放松，开始有劲说话，感觉他们又活过来了。
If the patient is seriously ill, he can only sit in the infusion room and take in oxygen. He sees the dying patients breathe oxygen, their expressions slowly stretch, their bodies become comfortable and relaxed, they begin to talk vigorously, and they feel alive again.
但这种情况少之又少，输液室和发热门诊里只有二十个吸氧接口。
But this is rare, with only twenty oxygen-absorbing interfaces in the infusion room and the fever clinic.
更多的病人，即使已经奄奄一息、生命濒危，我也没办法给他一口氧气吸，我给不出。
More patients, even if dying and dying, I can not give him a breath of oxygen, I can not give.
也许有人会问，那些身体已经好转的病人暂时停一会，先给其他人吸，但现实情况是，不到“吸氧时间到”的那一刻，是不会有人愿意把氧气让给其他病人的。
Some might ask patients who are getting better to stop for a while and give it to others, but the reality is that no one is willing to give up oxygen to other patients until the "oxygen time" has arrived.
医院的医疗资源太有限，面对这类病人，我能做的太有限，真的没办法了。
Hospital medical resources are too limited, in the face of this kind of patients, I can do too limited, really no way.
我至今也还记得，有一位被两个女儿架着胳膊来的老太太，有六七十岁，身体乏力、胸闷，病情挺重，但是医生检查生命体征后判断不是新冠肺炎，大概率是心梗，然而我们是新冠肺炎的定点医院，无法收治其他病人，只能劝离。
I remember, too, that an old woman of sixty or seventy years of age, with arms held by two daughters, was weak, stuffy and very ill, but the doctor examined vital signs and judged it not to be New Crown Pneumonia.
一方面，如果他们在发热门诊继续待着，感染的风险会非常大，而且老太太身体虚弱，一旦感染，随时都有生命危险。
On the one hand, if they stay at the fever clinic, the risk of infection is very high and the old lady is frail and life-threatening if infected.
另一方面，我们也不希望耽误他们去其他医院的救治时间。
On the other hand, we do not wish to delay their treatment in other hospitals.
听到让老人去别的医院，家属很生气，无法接受，坐在地上和我们耗时间。
Hearing the old man go to another hospital, the family was angry and could not accept, sitting on the ground and wasting time with us.
经过苦口婆心的劝导，家属还是带老人离开了。
After painstaking persuasion, the family took the old man away.
每次来的病人，出于医护人员的本能，都是要抓紧时间救人，但是特殊时期，我只能按规定开展工作，这是在那个当下我所能做的最大努力。
Every time the patient, out of the instinct of the medical staff, is to seize the time to save people, but special times, I can only work according to the rules, this is the best I can do at that time.
大哭一场，必须哭出来有的病人是在发热门诊离世，有的病人还没送到医院就已经没有呼吸了。
Some patients die in a fever clinic, while others do not breathe before they arrive at the hospital.
2月初的一天傍晚六点多，一位31岁的男子推着救护担架车冲进发热门诊，哭喊着“医生快来救救我妈，我妈快不行了”。
It was more than six o'clock one evening in early February when a 31-year-old man rushed into the fever clinic with a stretcher, crying, "Doctor come and save my mother. My mother is dying."
担架车上，老太太安静地平躺着，没有任何动静。
On the stretcher the old lady lay still and quiet, making no sign.
那个场景的冲击力很大，当时我就哭了。
The impact of the scene was so great that I cried.
其实，根据老人的面部特征，我当时判断老人离世了。
In fact, based on the facial features of the old man, I judged that the old man had died.
抱着最后一丝希望，还是协助把老人推进了抢救室，上了仪器之后，发现没有心跳、没有脉搏，确实已经走了。
With the last glimmer of hope, or to help push the old man into the rescue room, put on the instrument, found no heartbeat, no pulse, has really gone.
在抢救室外，老人的儿子跪在地上，一边拍着抢救室的玻璃墙，一边声嘶力竭的哭喊着“一定要救救我妈，她是为了照顾才感染的，我好了，她却感染了”。
In the rescue outdoors, the old man's son kneels on the ground, while patting the glass wall of the rescue room, screaming "I must save my mother, she was infected to take care of her, I am OK, she is infected."
我永远也忘不了这一幕。
I will never forget this scene.
听到母亲离世的消息时，老人的儿子已经哭不出来了，拿着那张“死亡证明”沉默着。
Hearing the news of his mother's death, the old man's son could no longer cry and was silent with the "death certificate."
安慰都显得太无力，我们给了他一把椅子，他就一直坐在抢救室外，没有任何言语、安静地呆坐着。
The consolation seemed so weak that we gave him a chair and he sat outside the rescue room, silently and without any words.
其实，老人在当天早上就需要救护车送来抢救的，但儿子预约一天120救护车，到了傍晚才有一辆去接。
In fact, the old man needed an ambulance to come to rescue him that morning, but his son made an appointment for 120 ambulances a day, and only in the evening did one pick them up.
老人的儿子在送母亲来的路上，应该就能判断出母亲已经走了，只不过他无法接受这个事实，不敢相信而已。
The old man's son, on his way to see his mother, should be able to tell that she was gone, but he could not believe it.
之前是儿子感染了新冠肺炎，老母亲把他照顾好了，自己却感染了，年迈病重，没挺过来。
Before his son contracted pneumonia, the old mother took care of him, but he infected himself, old age and serious illness, did not survive.
这位儿子受到自责、内疚，可能长期煎熬。
The son is remorseful and guilty and may suffer for a long time.
我今年36岁，和这个中年男子算是同龄人，我母亲和他母亲差不多年龄。
I am 36 years old, my mother is about the same age as his mother, a middle-aged man of my age.
我想到了自己，如果换作是我，面对这种情况，该是一种怎样的无助。
I think of myself, if it is me, in the face of this situation, what a helpless.
无法想象，也不敢想下去。
I can't imagine, I can't think of it.
那天下班，我脑海中一直回放着这位儿子为母亲求助的场景，我走进更衣室，刚坐下来，眼泪就涌了出来。
As I walked into the dressing room and sat down, tears welled up in my mind as I watched my son ask for help for his mother.
一个人默默地哭，一直哭、一直哭，我无法明确在伤心什么，但就是非常想哭，必须要哭出来。
A person silently cries, has been crying, has been crying, I can not clearly in the sad what, but is very want to cry, must cry out.
也许是觉得沮丧，连抢救都没抢救，病人就离世了；也许是害怕，这个病毒太致命，每天工作在充满病毒的环境中，说不害怕肯定是假的；也许是担心家人，上有老下有小，老人六七十岁，儿子才八岁，他们感染了可怎么办，如果我感染了，他们怎么办？从那之后，每天结束工作后，我都会在更衣室里安静地坐一坐，平复心情，试图消化掉当天的情绪，也反思一天的工作是否有可以做得更好的地方。
It may be that the virus is too deadly to work every day in a virus-ridden environment. It must be false to say no to fear; old people in their sixties and seventies and sons are eight years old. What if they get infected? I sit quietly in the locker room after that, trying to digest the day's emotions and reflecting on whether I can do better at work.
有时会觉得病人的离世，就像是上天在翻牌子，翻到谁就是谁。
Sometimes feel the patient's death, as if God is turning over the brand, turn who is who.
有一次，一个社区养老院里有人感染新冠肺炎，其他老人要送来检查。
In one case, a man in a community nursing home contracted pneumonia and other elderly people had to be examined.
6位七十多岁的老人，在送来的途中就走了一个。
Six people in their seventies left one on the way.
离世前，都没人知道他是不是感染了。
Before he died, no one knew if he was infected.
把情绪藏起来，压下去我也时常会感到内疚，被这种情绪煎熬着。
To hide my emotions, to hold them down, I often feel guilty and tormented by them.
深夜，闭上眼睛眼前就会出现白天没被抢救过来的病人的脸，这让我睡不着觉，失眠到一点、两点、三点、四点。
Late at night, close your eyes in front of the day will not be rescued from the face of patients, which makes me sleep, insomnia to one, two, three, four.
迷迷糊糊睡一会后，第二天又接着上班。
After sleeping in a daze, I went back to work the next day.
知道这种情绪会慢慢侵蚀我的身体，直到把我拖垮，但抗疫是个持久战，身体是革命的本钱。
Knowing that this mood will slowly eat into my body until it drags me down, but fighting it is a long battle, and the body is the capital of the revolution.
去找过医院专为医护人员排解情绪的心理医生，也许是我太不会表达，也许是心理医生的那一套对我不管用；面对心理医生时，怎么也说不出自己此前所经历的种种脆弱。
I went to the psychiatrist of the hospital to deal with the emotion of the medical staff, maybe I was too unable to express, maybe the psychological treatment of my failure; when faced with the psychiatrist, how can not describe their previous experience of vulnerability.
自来到一线，我一个人在医院附近租房住。
Since the first line, I alone in the vicinity of the hospital rental housing.
平时同事们的工作已经非常辛苦，他们的情绪也很压抑，不能再向同事传递这些负面情绪，更不敢和家人说。
Colleagues are already working very hard, and their emotions are depressing. They can no longer convey these negative feelings to their colleagues, much less to their families.
丈夫春节前去广州出差，因“封城”至今都回不来，家里只有老人和孩子，我说了他们会更担心。
My husband went to Guangzhou on a business trip for the Spring Festival. I said they would be even more worried because the city was still closed to the old and children.
情绪没有释放的出口，为了完成好岗位上的工作，只能逼自己变得“麻木”。
Emotions do not release the outlet, in order to complete a good job on the job, can only force themselves to become "numb."
让自己不去想这些，更不和别人提起这些，每天全身心投入工作中，把那些情绪都藏起来，压下去。
Don't think about it, don't mention it to others, put yourself into your work every day, hide those emotions and keep them down.
必须这样，要不然我就干不下去了，就彻底崩溃了。
I have to, or I won't be able to go on, and I'll be completely destroyed.
这么多天在发热门诊的经历，颠覆了我对生死的观念，受到这些冲击后，觉得自己变坚强了，也必须要变得坚强。
So many days in the fever clinic experience, overturned my concept of life and death, these shocks, feel that they have become strong, must become strong.
读书时，是父亲选的护理专业，起初我并不是很满意，直到临床实践，护理的病人转危为安时，我才真正感受到这个职业的高尚，从此爱上这份工作。
When I was a student, my father chose the nursing profession, at first I was not very satisfied, until the clinical practice, nursing patients turned to safety, I really feel the noble professional, love the job.
工作十多年了，一直保持“零投诉”，这就是病人对我最大的肯定。
Working for more than a decade, has maintained a "zero complaints", this is the biggest affirmation of my patients.
从2月中旬开始，火神山、雷神山和各家方舱医院陆续开放，很多病人都有了床位，有医护人员照顾，很大程度上分流了在定点医院的病人量。
Starting in mid-February, Mount Fire, Mount Raytheon and various cabin hospitals have been opened, and many patients have beds and are being attended by medical personnel, largely diverting the number of patients in designated hospitals.
病人逐渐减少，我们的工作也相对轻松一些。
As the number of patients dwindled down, our work was relatively easy.
排班也从前段时间变成上班一天休息一天。
Scheduling also changed from the previous period to one day off work.
领导看我们这一批医护人员辛苦，说要把我们换下来休息，我倒觉得我身体和情绪还行，可以继续坚持。
The leader sees us this batch of medical personnel hard, said wants to replace us to rest, I actually feel I am physically and emotionally OK, can continue to insist.
如今，回想这段时间，虽然经历这些让人心碎的时刻，但对我来说也蛮好，算是职业生涯中经验的积累吧。
Now, looking back on that time, despite these heartbreaking moments, it was good for me, as a career experience.
这里的病人和我以前在病房照顾的病人不一样。
The patients here are different from those I used to take care of in the ward.
以前病房里的病人你可以持续性地观察病情，但这里的病人需要你快速观察后一两分钟就要做判断，要么让病人平躺、要么吸氧，要么做心肺复苏。
Patients in the former wards can be observed continuously, but patients here need a minute or two of quick observation before being judged, either lying down, breathing oxygen, or CPR.
这是一个成熟的护士必备的技能，以前在普通病房工作，是没办法锻炼自己这方面能力的。
This is a mature nurse must-have skills, before working in the general ward, is not able to exercise their ability in this regard.
这段时间，虽然苦，也从来没想过不干了。
This time, although bitter, but also never thought not to do.
去支援一线，就像是消防员去救火，没有把火灾晾在一边，自己逃走的道理。
To support the line is like a firefighter going to the fire and not leaving the fire to dry and escape.
在这个岗位上，就要完成好这份工作。
In this position, we should finish the job well.
支援一线前期确实非常痛苦，但好在我能正确认识自己的情绪，克制它，激发出后来正面、积极的情绪。
The early days of support were really painful, but I was able to recognize my emotions correctly, restrain them, and spark positive, positive emotions later on.
我不知道疫情结束后，彻底放松下来，那些负面情绪会不会又找上来，但至少现在这个阶段我情绪管理得还好。
I don't know if I can completely relax after the outbreak and find out if those negative emotions will come back, but at least I'm in good mood at this stage.
这段时间，从来没有和别人说过这些话，今天说了这么多，倒也是一种释放。
This time, has never said these words with others, today said so much, but also a kind of release.
