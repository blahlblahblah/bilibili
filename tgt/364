记者/颜星悦编辑/石爱华宋建华菲律宾首都马尼拉的SanLazaro医院，一位感染新冠病毒的武汉游客在此离世2月2日，菲律宾当局宣布该国首宗因新冠病毒感染引发肺炎的死亡病例，这也是中国境外第一例死亡病例。
Authorities in the Philippines announced on February 2 that the country's first case of pneumonia caused by a new crown virus was the first death outside the country.
据世卫组织的菲律宾代表透露，死者44岁，来自中国武汉。
According to a WHO representative from the Philippines, the deceased was 44 years old from Wuhan, China.
据悉，该名患者确诊前出现发烧、咳嗽及喉咙痛等症状，在马尼拉圣拉萨罗医院（San Lazaro）确诊后隔离治疗。
The patient, who developed fever, cough and sore throat before diagnosis, was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila for isolation.
菲律宾卫生部长杜克说，患者接受治疗期间，情况稳定且有好转迹象，但在其生前最后的24小时，病情急剧恶化，最终死亡。
Philippine Health Secretary Rick Doek said the patient was in stable condition during treatment and showed signs of improvement, but his condition deteriorated sharply in the last 24 hours of his life and eventually died.
菲律宾卫生部2月5日通报，除了这位死者，菲律宾监测到的疑似新冠病毒感染者总数达133人，其中115人已被隔离观察，包括54名中国公民。
In addition to the dead, the Philippines has detected a total of 133 people suspected to be newly infected with the virus, 115 of whom have been quarantined, including 54 Chinese citizens, the Health Department said on Tuesday.
董宁是被隔离在菲律宾医院的中国游客之一，今年30岁。
Dong Ning, 30, is one of the Chinese tourists quarantined in a Philippine hospital.
1月21日他从南京经厦门到达马尼拉，没有武汉接触史。
January 21, he arrived in Manila from Nanjing via Xiamen, no contact with Wuhan history.
1月31日，他吹了一夜空调后出现咳嗽、流鼻涕等症状，之后他被送往医院要求隔离，“我觉得自己只是感冒”，董宁说。
On January 31, after a night of air-conditioning and coughing and runny noses, he was taken to the hospital to be quarantined. "I think I'm just catching a cold," Downing said.
由于菲律宾没有核酸检测试剂盒，确诊筛查过程周期长，虽然董宁的CT检查、血检、尿检均无异常，但他还要等待口腔和鼻腔黏膜的检测结果才能解除隔离，他了解到，至少有20余名华人正在菲律宾接受隔离，其中已有确诊病例。
Since the Philippines did not have nucleic acid test kits, the diagnostic screening process was long, although Dong Ning's CT, blood test and urine tests were normal, but he had to wait for the results of oral and nasal mucosa tests to be released. He learned that at least 20 Chinese were being quarantined in the Philippines and that there had been confirmed cases.
截至发稿，董宁仍在等待检查结果，他以口述的方式记录了他在菲律宾医院隔离期间的经历。
At the time of writing, Dong Ning was still awaiting the results of the examination and he had verbally recorded his experiences during his isolation in a hospital in the Philippines.
救护车赶到酒店，将董先生送到医院隔离因咳嗽被隔离看护1月31日我们一行六人，1月21日从南京经厦门转机到菲律宾首都马尼拉。
An ambulance rushed to the hotel and took Mr Dong to hospital to be quarantined with coughing. January 31 Six of us travelled from Nanjing to Manila via Xiamen on January 21.
当时江苏和福建未有确诊病例，我也没有出过南京。
There were no confirmed cases in Jiangsu and Fujian at that time, nor had I been outside Nanjing.
我们在马尼拉机场测量了体温，顺利过关，当时马路上已经有很多人戴口罩了。
We had our temperature taken at Manila airport and got through, and there were already a lot of people wearing masks on the road.
马尼拉并不是我们的目的地，我们在酒店睡了一晚，第二天就飞到菲律宾西南部的度假胜地巴拉望岛，在这里我们六人分散，各自住不同的酒店。
Manila was not our destination. We slept overnight at the hotel and flew the next day to the resort of Palawan in the southwestern Philippines, where we were scattered and stayed in separate hotels.
1月30日，我出现了咳嗽的症状。
On January 30th, I developed symptoms of a cough.
当日白天，我穿着防晒服在海里游泳，上岸后没有及时换，这可能是我感冒的原因。
During the day, I was swimming in a sun-proof suit. I didn't change it when I got ashore. This may be the reason for my cold.
酒店里的空调开得很低，被子只有一层床单，夜里我被冻醒，今天（31日）扁桃体就开始发炎，流鼻涕，嗓子里有痰。
The air-conditioning in the hotel is very low, the quilt is only a bed sheet, I was frozen at night, today (31) tonsils began inflammation, runny nose, sputum in the throat.
在我看来，这点小感冒不算什么，但非常时期，还是注意一点好。
In my opinion, this little cold is nothing, but the extraordinary period, or pay attention to a little better.
于是我一边咳嗽，一边下楼找口罩。
I coughed and went downstairs to look for a mask.
下楼时，酒店大堂的工作人员没有戴口罩，等我转了一圈回来，发现大厅十多个人突然全都带上口罩了，他们看着我，离我远远的。
Downstairs, the hotel lobby staff did not wear masks, and when I returned from a tour, I found that more than a dozen people in the hall suddenly put on masks, they looked at me, away from me.
我觉得有点奇怪，回客房后，电话立刻响了，是前台打来的。
Strange to me, when I got back to the guest room, the call immediately rang. It was from the front desk.
他们问我从哪里来，这时我才意识到，他们怀疑我感染了新型冠状病毒。
They asked me where I was coming from before I realized that they suspected me of having contracted the new coronavirus.
我赶忙解释自己不是来自湖北，对方询问我是否咳嗽、发烧，我如实讲了情况，前台很直接地跟我说：“你需要去医院看一下。
I hastened to explain that I was not from Hubei, and was asked if I had a cough or a fever. I told the truth and the front desk said directly to me, "You need to see the hospital.
”我再次下楼，酒店经理递给我一瓶矿泉水和几副口罩，我测了三次体温，都是36.4度。
I went downstairs again ， and the hotel manager handed me a bottle of mineral water and a couple of masks ， and I took my temperature three times ， all 36.4 degrees ．
我按照工作人员要求，在一张纸上写下我抵达菲律宾后的全部行程，包括航班、餐厅信息。
As requested by the staff, I wrote down on a piece of paper the full itinerary of my arrival in the Philippines, including flight and restaurant information.
我认为自己只要配合他们，去医院检查，拍个CT，没有病就没问题了。
I think as long as I cooperate with them, go to the hospital, take a CT, no disease will be no problem.
正要出发去医院，经理留住我，让我先回自己的房间等待，他们说会安排医生过来先看一下。
Just as I was leaving for the hospital, the manager stopped me and asked me to wait in my room first. They said they would arrange for the doctor to come and have a look.
我还是那个想法：等医生过来检测，确认我不发烧，我就可以继续自己的行程了。
I still think: when the doctor comes to check that I don't have a fever, I can continue my journey.
我在房间等待一个多小时后，前台突然通知我带着行李下楼。
After I had been waiting in my room for over an hour, the front desk suddenly told me to come downstairs with my luggage.
这次下楼，大厅里多了很多人，他们都“全副武装”，护士穿着防护服，门外有一辆警车一辆救护车，都是来接我的。
Down stairs, there were many more people in the hall. They were "heavily armed," nurses were wearing protective clothing, and there was a police car and an ambulance outside the door, all of whom had come to meet me.
我上车时，酒店经理跑来给了我一把钱，当时也没数。
When I got into the car, the hotel manager came and gave me a handful of money, which I didn't count at the time.
我心里琢磨，这是给我应急的钱吗？这个经理对我还是很好的，在房间等候的时候，他来给我送了餐和饮料。
I thought to myself, is this for me emergency money? This manager is still very good to me, while waiting in the room, he came to bring me a meal and drinks.
很多人都不敢靠近我。
A lot of people are afraid to come near me.
到了医院，我直接被安排入住病房。
Arriving at the hospital, I was placed directly in the ward.
我很懵，问医生接下来的安排，医生告诉我要在菲律宾待14天。
I was stunned and asked the doctor what I would do next. The doctor told me to stay in the Philippines for 14 days.
我有点崩溃，14天，我签证都过期了，岂不是要“黑”在菲律宾了？后来我才知道，这间病房是专门用来隔离的，有空调，但不允许开，而且必须开窗通风。
I was a bit crashing. For 14 days, my visa had expired. Didn't I want to "black" in the Philippines? Later I learned that this ward was specially designed for isolation, air-conditioned, but not open, and had to be ventilated by a window.
窗户没有纱窗，但是加了栏杆。
There were no screens on the windows, but they were railed.
窗户对面是一些病房，偶尔看到一些病人起身。
Across the window were wards, and now and then some patients rose.
门口有一块门帘，上面英文写着：“ 拜托！请不要离开这个区域！谢谢。
There is a curtain at the door. It says in English: "Please! Please don't leave this area! Thank you."
”隔离病房里有两张很窄的床，一张病床，一张检查用床，不管哪张，都不舒服。
The isolation ward had two narrow beds, a bed and a bed for examination, and neither was comfortable.
房间没有无线网，4G流量不便宜，想看视频打发时间有点奢侈。
The room has no wireless network, 4G traffic is not cheap, want to see video to pass the time a little extravagant.
洗手间配有一个马桶、一个淋浴喷头、一个洗手池，洗手池的水龙头和抽水马桶都没水，需要从一个黑桶里舀水冲厕所。
The toilet is equipped with a toilet, a shower nozzle, a sink with no water from the faucet and the flush toilet, which needs to be dipped from a black bucket.
沐浴没有热水，只能用冷水洗，我害怕冷水洗澡会加重感冒，忍着不洗。
Bathing without hot water, can only be washed in cold water, I am afraid cold water bath will aggravate the cold, not wash.
这天晚上护士给我送来了一盒泡面（可是没有热水），一只N95口罩，也是我唯一领到的N95口罩，一直用着。
That night the nurse brought me a box of noodles (but no hot water) and a N95 mask, the only N95 I had received, was still in use.
董宁隔离病房实景，门帘上写着：“拜托！不要离开这片区域！谢谢！”检查无恙不能出院2月1日我一夜没睡，昏昏沉沉地被热醒，枕头上一大片汗渍。
Dong Ning isolation ward real scene, the door curtain said: "Please! Do not leave this area! Thank you!" No discharge from the hospital on February 1, I did not sleep, drowsily woke up, a lot of sweat on the pillow.
早上6点，护士打电话来给我送药，说是治疗咳嗽的，我拿到一看，是泡腾片。
At 6 a. m., the nurse called and gave me the medicine, saying it was for my cough. I got it and it was a bubble wrap.
一个白色的泡腾片冲在水里，没有完全化开，喝一口，酸得呛人。
A white piece of effervescent rushed into the water, not completely opened, a drink, acrid acid.
我向护士要一些阿莫西林（消炎药），没有给。
I asked the nurse for some amoxicillin, but not for it.
两个护士找了辆医用车，开车带我去隔离楼外不远的地方拍了CT，CT室是透明的，隔壁输液室里好多当地人趴在玻璃窗上看我。
The two nurses found a medical car and drove me out of the isolation building for a CT scan, which was transparent and where a lot of locals were looking at me through the window next door.
因为医生还没来上班，肺部的CT结果还要等一会。
Since the doctor is not here yet, the CT findings of the lung will have to wait.
我问护士，如果情况良好是否能离开，她低声说抱歉。
I asked the nurse if she could leave if it was all right and she whispered sorry.
我跟她解释，在国内，如果没有亲密接触过感染者，没有发烧等症状，是可以基本排除的，我很希望他们能多问问医生，多了解中国（的情况），让我走，我可以自我隔离。
I explained to her that at home, if there is no intimate contact with infected people, no fever, and other symptoms can be basically ruled out, I would like them to consult more doctors, learn more about China, let me go, I can isolate myself.
菲律宾的医护人员非常有礼貌，今天抽血、取鼻腔和口腔粘液，因为把我弄疼了，他们一直跟我道歉。
Filipino health care workers are very polite. Today, they take blood, nasal cavity and oral mucus, because it hurts me, they always apologize to me.
中午，护士给我送了午餐，是牛肉和一袋粉丝一样的汤。
At noon, the nurse brought me lunch, beef and a bag of soup like a bag of fans.
我中午测了体温、血压，一切正常。
I took my temperature and blood pressure at noon. Everything is OK.
酒店的经理大老远来到医院，送了水和一大包的零食水果给我，还给我写了一封信，好感动。
The manager of the hotel came all the way to the hospital, gave me water and a big bag of snacks and fruit, and wrote me a letter.
我回信谢过他，并告诉他不要担心，我觉得自己只是感冒而已。
I wrote back to thank him and told him not to worry. I thought I was just catching a cold.
因为昨晚没睡好，我下午睡了一觉。
I slept away in the afternoon because I didn't sleep well last night.
醒来时，医生来了，他告诉我CT和血检、尿检结果都OK，如果政府同意的话可以让我早点回去，明天就可以让走。
When I woke up, the doctor came. He told me the results of the CT and blood and urine tests were OK.
想到明天可以回家，我很激动，他们还祝福中国可以早点战胜疫情。
I was excited to think that I would be able to go home tomorrow. They also wished that China would overcome the epidemic earlier.
但是医生很快又回来反馈，说政府暂时不能让我走，要等鼻腔检测。
But the doctor was quick to report back that the government could not let me go for a while, waiting for a nasal exam.
今天是我来菲律宾的第13天，明天，我的签证就过期了。
Today is the 13th day of my visit to the Philippines. Tomorrow my visa will expire.
酒店老板的信进隔离室后才穿防护服2月2日菲律宾的电视台正在轮番报道新型冠状病毒的新闻，菲国政府官方今天通报，一名武汉籍中国游客，因感染新型冠状病毒在马尼拉圣拉萨罗医院离世。
Chinese tourist dies in Manila's San Lassaro hospital with a new coronavirus, Philippine government officials reported today (Feb. 2) as Philippine television aired news of a new coronavirus.
菲律宾因此提高了预防措施，航班停飞，签证停办。
As a result, the Philippines increased precautionary measures, flight suspensions and visa suspension.
民众也是一窝蜂抢购口罩，很多药店挂着醒目的“口罩售罄”。
People are also rushing to buy masks, and many pharmacies wear eye-catching "masks sold out."
菲律宾的口罩平日里只卖5比索，约等于0.7元人民币，疫情出现后，口罩涨价到100多比索，约十几元人民币，对当地人来说，已经很贵了，而且有钱也未必可以买到。
Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the price of face masks has risen to more than 100 pesos, or about 10 yuan, which is already expensive for local people and not necessarily affordable.
昨天，一对和我同航班飞来的母子，被隔离在马尼拉圣拉萨罗医院，通过微博给我发了私信。
Yesterday, a mother and son from my flight were quarantined at Manila's San Lassaro Hospital and sent me personal letters via microblog.
她的孩子5岁，发烧了。
Her child is 5 years old and has a fever.
这位母亲告诉我，那边的医护人员不敢碰他们，直到孩子退烧才给他补打液盐。
The mother told me that the paramedics there didn't dare touch them until the baby was out of fever and salted him.
他们所在的这家医院出现了第一个“武汉肺炎”的海外死亡病例，这位母亲因此心情不好，她有些恐慌，问我：“如果真的感染，在马尼拉是不是就等死了？”我安慰她，不要乱想了，多喝点水。
The mother of her first overseas death from Wuhan Pneumonia, who was in a panic, asked me, "If the infection is real, is it just waiting to die in Manila?" I comforted her by not thinking about it and drinking more water.
今天，护士再次给我的口鼻腔进行粘液取样，医院条件有限，只能把样本送到首都马尼拉的医院去化验。
Today, the nurse again took mucus samples from my mouth and nose. Conditions in the hospital were so limited that they had to send samples to a hospital in the capital, Manila.
护士说，除我之外，还有一个中法家庭在这里被隔离，妈妈是中国人，爸爸是法国人，小孩在发烧。
The nurse said that in addition to me, there is a Sino-French family isolated here, mother is Chinese, father is French, the child is feverish.
我心里一颤。
My heart quivered.
我有点担心自己被间接感染，他们的防护服一直放在隔离病房内，护士进门才穿上，只有薄薄一层。
I was a little worried that I was being indirectly infected. Their protective clothing had been kept in the isolation ward until the nurse came in and put it on only one thin layer.
我的消毒卫生用品是一块肥皂，不是专用的洗手液。
My disinfectant is a bar of soap, not a special hand sanitizer.
他们对于确诊病例和疑似病例没有明确的区域划分，这很容易引发交叉感染。
They do not have a clear regional division between confirmed and suspected cases, which can easily lead to cross-infection.
午饭没心情吃，我全天在病房里哪里都不能去，两个床来回躺，没有运动，大便不通畅。
Lunch is not in the mood, I can not go anywhere in the ward all day, two beds lying back and forth, no exercise, feces not open.
医生告诉我，已经帮我搞定了签证，叫我不要担心，但我担心的真不只是这个。
The doctor told me I had got my visa done and told me not to worry, but I was worried about more than that.
隔离期间，医院提供的食物没有核酸试剂诊断难2月3日我联系到的在菲律宾隔离的中国人有20多个。
During isolation, hospitals provided food without nucleic acid reagents difficult to diagnose February 3 I contacted over 20 Chinese in isolation in the Philippines.
我觉得菲律宾的医护人员还不能全面了解这个病毒。
I don't think health care workers in the Philippines know all about the virus yet.
对病患的确诊，他们没有核酸试剂，靠CT或者鼻腔黏膜的化验。
To diagnose the patient, they do not have nucleic acid reagent, rely on CT or nasal mucosa test.
从昨天开始，菲律宾再次提升了防控级别。
Since yesterday, the Philippines has again raised the level of control.
最近14天去过中国内地和港澳地区的人，无论哪国国籍，都被禁止入境，菲律宾籍的除外。
People who have been to China, Hong Kong and Macao in the last 14 days, regardless of their nationality, are prohibited from entering the country, except those of Filipino nationality.
从中国入境的人，一下飞机就要被隔离14日。
People entering China will be quarantined for 14 days after they get off the plane.
菲律宾与中国大陆的多个航班陆续取消，最先取消的是菲律宾的航空公司。
Several Philippine flights with China have been canceled, with Philippine airlines being the first to cancel them.
我乘坐的厦航也被取消了。
My Xiamen was also canceled.
今天中午吃的猪肉沫和牛肉汤，妈妈微信提醒我，我已经几天没吃蔬菜了。
Today lunch of pork foam and beef soup, my mother reminded me that I have not eaten vegetables in a few days.
医院蚂蚁特别厉害，食物残渣没有及时清理一会儿就吸引了一大群，护士看到地上的蚂蚁，开玩笑说，“我马上让它们搬家。
The ants in the hospital were so bad that the food scraps didn't clear up in time to attract a large crowd. The nurse saw the ants on the ground and joked, "I'll let them move right away.
”菲律宾医院的隔离病房是免费的，我不需要花任何钱，只需要配合他们的工作就可以。
The isolation ward at the Philippine hospital is free, and I don't need any money, just to work with them.
菲律宾的医生都非常友好，对我很耐心，我也常常和医护人员聊天，跟他们说武汉肺炎在中国的情况，让他们加强防护措施。
Doctors in the Philippines are very friendly and patient with me, and I often talk to doctors and nurses about the situation of Wuhan pneumonia in China and ask them to take more protective measures.
现在让我感到迷茫的有两件事，一个是不确定什么时候解除隔离，第二是解除隔离后不知道坐什么航班回家。
Now I'm confused by two things, one is not sure when the isolation will be lifted, and the other is that I don't know what flight to go home from isolation.
菲律宾这边不能直飞，肯定要转机，可能要从香港和曼谷的机场飞回家，想到其他国家和地区也可能会有临时的出入境政策和隔离政策，回家必定要一波三折了。
The Philippines can not fly directly, sure to turn the corner, may have to fly home from Hong Kong and Bangkok airports, think of other countries and regions may also have temporary immigration policies and isolation policies, will have to go home.
护士来帮我测体温、血压、心跳，一切正常。
The nurse came to take my temperature, blood pressure and heartbeat. Everything was fine.
他们送来了麦片和热水，帮我整理了床铺、丢了垃圾，非常体贴尽责。
They brought me oatmeal and hot water, helped me make my bed, lost my garbage, and was very considerate.
护士告诉我，鼻腔黏膜检测结果出来后，如果无异常我就可以回家，现在就等结果了。
The nurse told me that after the nasal mucosa test results came out, if there were no abnormalities I could go home and wait for the results.
编者注：截至2月6日发稿，董宁已经被隔离7天，因为还没等到检测结果，尚不能解除隔离。
Editor's Note: As of February 6, Dong Ning has been isolated for 7 days, because the test results have not yet been released.
