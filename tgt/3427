3月13日，我亲历了疫情下的“美国紧急状态” | 口述实录。
On March 13, I witnessed the "American emergency" or "oral record" of the epidemic.

深度和角度——这就是我们能做的。

这次的“紧急状态”恰好在13号星期五，触了美国人的大霉头文 | 马纶鹏阳光普照的下午，似乎一切都慵懒了。
The "state of emergency" happened to be on Friday the 13th, touching the American with its ugly head and peng peng, and everything seemed to be languid.
美国没有杨柳，便分外地想念“沾衣欲湿杏花雨，吹面不寒杨柳风”。
There is no willow in the United States, they miss "wet apricot rain wet clothes, blowing face not cold willow".
特朗普在3月13日下午三点宣布了“国家紧急状态”，这是迄今为止美国应对新冠肺炎疫情最大的举措。
Trump declared a "state of emergency" at 3 p.m. on March 13, the largest US response to the outbreak of pneumonia so far.
看着已经是一片空荡荡的政府和学校办公区，而镇上的缅因街(Main Street, 直译过来就是主街)的车子却依然穿梭不停，时不时还有人隔着车窗和你友善打个招呼。
Look at the already empty government and school districts, and the town's Main Street car keeps shuttling around, occasionally greeting you friendly through the windows.
这种戏剧化的对比，前方的紧张，而日常又如此惬意，不仅有些莞尔。
This dramatic contrast, the tension ahead, and the daily contentment, is not only somewhat gusty.
这恐怕堪比任何好莱坞大片的开头，又是最好的超现实主义投射。
This is probably the beginning of any Hollywood blockbuster and the best surrealist projection.
“Virus is more democratic” 病毒更民主看着如此巨大的反差，我先想到了齐泽克在评价武汉封城之后对于意识形态和种族主义的批评，特别是那种末世感，犹如《我是传奇》里面高楼林立，却人影都不见一个的冲击：“我们中的有些人，包括我自己，偷偷地遐想身处于当前的武汉，体验一种后末世（post-apocalyptic）电影设定的真实生命。
The Virus is more democratic, and I think of Zizek's criticism of ideology and racism after his evaluation of the Wuhan Sealing, especially the sense of end-of-life, as if "I am Legend" was full of buildings, but none of us: "Some of us, including myself, secretly fantasize about being in the present Wuhan and experiencing a post-apocalyptic life.
城市里空荡荡的街道提供了一幅怡然自在的非消费主义世界图景”。
The empty streets of the city provide a comfortable, non-consumerist picture of the world.
中美国情不同，再深挖，也是东西方文化与价值观的迥异。
Chinese and American situations are different, and digging deeper is also the difference between East and West culture and values.
所以美国不会封城，也完全做不到，从资源上，从法律上，从所谓捍卫人权上。
So the United States will not close its cities, nor will it be able to do so at all, in terms of resources, the law, the so-called defence of human rights.
但中国，特别是武汉这么大代价换来的两个月的缓冲期、积累经验以及应对措施，却都一一在西方完美落空，没有得到重视和使用。
But the two-month buffer period, the accumulated experience, and the response that China, and Wuhan in particular, have bought at such a high price, have all been fizzled out in the West and have not been taken seriously and used.
疫情刚开始时候的14天防疫期没有，刚传播的时候意大利人还是聚会、派对不断，美国到现在还是把很多轻症患者送回家，自我隔离。
The epidemic did not begin with a 14-day epidemic, when Italians were gathering and partying, and the United States is still sending home many light cases and isolating themselves.
摩洛哥的一个同事跟我说，“Virus is more democratic”，病毒才更民主：它不欺生，不怕强权，不分老少，不问国籍，不辨贵贱，更没有种族主义、民族主义，性别歧视，它的对象就是一个个活生生的人，血肉之躯。
A colleague from Morocco told me that "Virus is more democratic" and that the virus is more democratic: it does not deceive, it does not fear power, young or old, nationality, class, racism, nationalism, sexism, and it is aimed at human beings, human beings, flesh and blood.
这话里太多苍凉和无奈。
There was too much desolation and helplessness in this.
走在“斜阳画角哀”的街头，想想两个月以来中国经历的种种，再努力想未来美国人，在美国的华人可能会有的经历。
Walk through the streets in the oblique sun, think about what China has been through for the past two months, and then try to think about what future Americans, Chinese in the United States, might have experienced.
1. 要赶紧在这个周末在做好防护的前提下去看场电影；2. 明天就在镇上小费收得巨高的理发店把长发变成板寸，下一次还不知道什么时候；3. 周一图书馆开门就去借些小说和历史书，不能总是靠电脑屏幕来打发时间。
2.Turn your long hair into an inch tomorrow at the big-tipped barber shop in town. The next time you don't know when, the library will open its doors and borrow some novels and history books.
4. 要向中国的朋友们讨教在线工作和在线课程的经验，美国大部分人还是没有完全融合到在线时代，这当然有利有弊。
To learn from their Chinese friends about online jobs and courses, most Americans are still not fully integrated into the online age, which has both advantages and disadvantages.
至于抢购食品，暂时不了吧，美国人的冰箱都很大，就像这个国家Costco的量贩货物，一般家庭都会有一两周的存货。
As for snapping up food, not for a while, Americans have large refrigerators, just like Costco's peddlers in this country, and the average family has a week or two of stock.
中国人爱的大米、面粉都还有，水也够。
Chinese love rice, flour and enough water.
口罩早在一个月前各种药店比如CVS、Walmart都售罄了，据说都被爱国华人买了捐回中国。
The masks were sold out a month ago in pharmacies like CVS and Walmart, and are said to have been bought back by patriotic Chinese.
美国人都没有人戴，据说像纽约、洛杉矶这样的城市密集的地方也极少，戴了也会被认为异类。
It is said that urban agglomerations like New York and Los Angeles are rare and can be considered alien if worn.
他们没有这种文化，全是裸奔，这时候只能选择深居简出，说话靠吼。
They do not have this culture, all run naked, this time can only choose to live in seclusion, yell.
但，这很快就会随着紧急状态的深入而改变。
However, this will soon change as the state of emergency deepens.
CNN已经刊文，“Take this seriously. Coronavirus is about to change your life for a while”这不是开玩笑，新冠肺炎将改变美国人的生活。
CNN has published, "Take this seriously. Coronavirus is about about to change your life for a while." It's not a joke. The new crown pneumonia will change the lives of Americans.
紧急状态下的美国美国现有的“政府紧急状态”源于1976年美国总统福特签署的《美国全国紧急状态法》。
The existing "state of emergency" in the United States stems from the National Emergency Law signed by President Ford in 1976.
法案规定了总统宣布国家进入紧急状态下拥有的至少一百多项紧急权力，涉及生产方式调控、向国外派兵、实行国内戒严、管制企业运营等，甚至可以在一定条件下重新使用化学和生物武器。
It establishes at least 100 emergency powers that the President has to declare a state of emergency, including the regulation of production methods, the sending of troops abroad, the imposition of internal curfews, the regulation of the operation of enterprises, and even the reintroduction of chemical and biological weapons under certain conditions.
历史上美国非战而宣称“紧急状态”的并不多，20世纪主要有1933年总统罗斯福为了应对经济危机和大萧条，宣布紧急状态，靠着特殊授予权，美国制定了《全国产业复兴法》，对于经济生产方式、企业运营等进行了部署，著名的“凯恩斯主义”和“国家扩张理论与充分就业”走上了世界舞台。
In 1933, when President Roosevelt proclaimed a state of emergency in response to the economic crisis and the Great Depression, the United States enacted the National Industrial Revival Act, the deployment of economic production methods, business operations, and the famous "Keynesian" and "State Expansion Theory and Full Employment" onto the world stage.
而1979年伊朗发生伊斯兰革命，伊朗扣留了美国52名人质，人质危机发生之后，总统卡特宣布国家进入紧急状态，准备各种方法进行斡旋和营救，过程漫长而惊险。
In the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, in which Iran held 52 American hostages, President Jimmy Carter declared a state of emergency and prepared various methods for mediation and rescue, a long and dangerous process.
多年之后，根据此事改编的《逃离德黑兰》获得第85届奥斯卡最佳影片。
Years later, Escape from Tehran, based on the story, won the 85th Academy Award for Best Picture.
这次的紧急状态是有强大的法理支撑的，那就是1988年签署的“Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act” 罗伯特·斯塔福德灾难救助和紧急援助法。
The state of emergency is backed up by a strong jurisprudence: the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, signed in 1988.
该法案构成并赋予了大多数联邦灾难响应活动的法定权力。
The Act constitutes and confers statutory powers on most federal disaster response activities.
喜欢美剧的朋友们，也许不会陌生，因为在Netflix的《纸牌屋》就有Underwood总统利用The Stafford Act含混的条文，宣布“紧急状态”，绕过国会直接从FEMA（美国联邦应急管理署）拿到应急救灾的钱。
Friends who love American dramas may be familiar, because in Netflix's House of Cards President Underwood used The Stafford Act to declare a "state of emergency," bypassing Congress and getting emergency money directly from the FEMA.
换一个角度看，“国家紧急状态下”的美国可能从自由竞争的市场经济临时转成一个准社会主义国家形态，政府有权调动各种资源打赢一场战役，包括物资、人力、资源等等的管控，以及国民卫队的使用等。
In other words, the US, "in a state of national emergency," could be transformed temporarily from a free-competitive market economy into a quasi-socialist state, with the government empowered to mobilize resources to win a battle, including material, human, resource, and other controls, and the use of the National Guard.
根据Fox News的推测，这一次特朗普的“紧急状态”可以至少为国家解冻“高达500亿美元的资金”。
This time, according to Fox News, Trump's "state of emergency" could unfreeze at least "as much as $50 billion" for the country.
有了钱，自然好打仗。
Money makes for war.
特朗普已经下令各个州设立应对新冠病毒的中心，并启动应急计划，还敦促各州立即设立紧急行动中心。
Trump has ordered states to set up centers to deal with the new crown virus, and to activate contingency plans, and has urged states to establish emergency operations centers immediately.
美国疾控中心CDC也配合说，下周将提供多达50万份新冠病毒测试盒，同时还将有数百万份新冠病毒测试紧随其后。
The CDC also said it would offer up to 500,000 new crown virus test kits next week, with millions more to follow.
而美国创新的病毒测试途径就是其特有的“drive through”——开车顺路检测。
America's innovative approach to testing for viruses is its unique "drivethrough" test of driving by the way.
美国的“drive thru”文化简直是遍地开花，各种快餐店、洗车店，甚至银行都有，让你坐在车上，经过服务店的特殊窗口，就买到食物，完成交易。
Fast food restaurants, car wash shops and even banks all have them. They let you sit in a car, pass a special window in a service store, and buy food and complete a deal.
“drive thru”在国内也有，但很少见，中文音译“得来速”，因为这种大而粗的方式只适合建立在“车轮上的国家”。
Chinese transliteration is rare in China because this large and crude method is only suitable for countries built on wheels.
之后美国可能有的检测程序是红外量体温— 开车测试(drive-through）—实验室送检—24-36小时出检测结果。
The next possible test procedure in the United States would be an infrared temperature-driving test - a laboratory test - with 24-36 hours of test results.
这次的“紧急状态”恰好在13日星期五，触了美国人的大霉头，所谓的黑色星期五，说法既来自宗教，比如耶稣门徒的犹大就是第13人，也有历史原因，比如美国著名的“十三俱乐部”，近年来的各种流行文化和恐怖电影也让黑色星期五深入人心。
"The state of emergency" on Friday 13th touched the head of the American people, the so-called Black Friday, saying that Judas, a disciple of Jesus, was the 13th person, and there were historical reasons, such as the famous "13th Club," and the popular culture and horror films of recent years had made Black Friday popular.
选择在这么一个节点宣布，特朗普考虑的一定是疫情控制，而不是“好日子”。
The choice at such a point is to announce that Trump must be thinking about epidemic control, not "good days."
果不其然，3点宣布，马上纳斯达克和道琼斯应声大涨。
Sure enough, 3 o'clock announced that immediately Nasdaq and Dow Jones jumped.
而对于每一个生活在美国的人，每一个还在疫情威胁下的我们，什么时候才能欢快、无碍地过上周末？征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
And for everyone living in the United States, every one of us is still under the threat of the epidemic, when can we happily, without hindrance over the weekend? Call for March, the recovery of everything.
