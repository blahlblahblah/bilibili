本报记者 高瑜静 北京报道对战新冠病毒的潜在药物瑞德西韦（Remdesivir）尚处于临床试验中，宣布成功仿制开发瑞德西韦的上市公司却股价跌宕，落得一地鸡毛。
Reevesivir, a potential drug for the new crown virus, is still in clinical trials, and the listed company that announced its successful imitation of Rhetsevir has seen its share price tumble.
近日，上交所分别作出对博瑞医药（688166.SH）予以监管关注的决定和时任董秘王征野予以通报批评的决定，对物产中大（600704.SH）及时任董秘陈海滨予以通报批评。
Recently, the Shanghai Stock Exchange decided to pay attention to the supervision of BORI Medicine (688166.SH) and then Secretary-General Wang Zheng-no by notice, and criticized the timely appointment of CUHK (600704.SH) as Tung Secretary-General of the Waterfront.
深交所则对海南海药（000566.SZ）出具警示函。
The Shenzhen Stock Exchange issues a warning letter to Hainan Hai Medicine (000566. SZ).
三家上市公司被监管处罚，导火索均与不准确披露瑞德西韦研制近况相关，违反了《股票上市规则》。
Three listed companies were subject to regulatory penalties, all of which were linked to inaccurate disclosure of Rhetsevier's development status, in violation of the Stock Listing Rules.
公告在前，处罚随至。
Before the announcement, the punishment is available.
前后之间，A股市场情绪被瑞德西韦概念准确“点燃”。
Before and after, A-share market sentiment was precisely "ignited" by Rhett's concept.
博瑞医药2月14日创下72.38元/股的股价峰值，相比披露公告前2月11日的收盘价涨幅达66.66%。
Berry's shares peaked Feb. 14 at 72.38 yuan, up 66.66% from February 11, the day before the announcement.
海南海药公告后的首个交易日，开盘不久即以34.9万手封死涨停板，2月18日股价攀升至10.29元/股的峰值。
Hainan's first trading day after the announcement, shortly after the opening day of 349,000 hand block trading, February 18 rose to 10.29 yuan / share peak.
物产中大2月13日在“上证 e 互动”平台回答投资者提问时提及子公司生产瑞德西韦项目后，公司股价在当天创历史新高至5.82元/股。
The company's share price hit a record high of 5.82 yuan a share on the day after answering questions from investors on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Interactive platform.
暗潮涌动间，专利授权及合格生产的考验，横贯在有意仿制瑞德西韦的中国药企面前。
Underwater surges, patent licensing and qualified production tests run across the face of Chinese pharmaceutical companies intent on imitating Rhettigrew.
专利强制许可交易所在对博瑞医药、物产中大、海南海药监管处罚时，均在相关文件中指出，涉事上市公司没有获得美国Gilead公司授权。
The compulsory patent licensing exchange, when imposing penalties on the supervision of Boreal medicine, CUHK and Hainan, all pointed out in relevant documents that the listed companies involved had not been authorized by Gilead Corporation of the United States.
所谓授权，指的是美国吉利德（Gilead）研发瑞德西韦过程中所申请专利的授权。
The so-called delegation refers to Gilead's authorization to apply for a patent in the process of developing Rhettigrew.
根据国家知识产权局2月14日公布的《抗击新型冠状病毒肺炎专利信息研报》，在2011年至2018年间，吉利德公司就瑞德西韦共申请了9项专利。
According to the State Intellectual Property Office's February 14 Patent Information Study on Fighting New Coronavirus Pneumonia, Geely filed nine patents for Rhettigrew between 2011 and 2018.
此前，北京务实知识产权发展中心主任程永顺告诉《中国经营报》记者：“一般而言，一个新药需要经过国家药监局对安全性、可靠性及生产稳定性等技术性指标进行严格审查批准后才能生产上市。
Earlier, Cheng Yongshun, director of the Beijing Practical Intellectual Property Development Center, told China Business News: "In general, a new drug needs to go through rigorous examination and approval by the State Administration of Pharmacy before it can be marketed.
如果是有专利的新药，仿制药企只有在专利权人的专利药品获准上市后，才能考虑向权利人提出相关药品的专利授权许可。
In the case of a patented new medicine, a generic pharmaceutical company may only consider granting a patent license to the holder of the patent right after the patented medicine of the patentee has been approved for the market.
”不过，随着新冠肺炎疫情在全球持续蔓延扩散，世界贸易组织（WTO）成员国一致通过的“多哈宣言”中的专利药品强制实施许可制度，也被越来越多提及。
But as the global outbreak of pneumonia continues to spread, so too is the compulsory licensing of patented medicines in the Doha Declaration unanimously adopted by members of the World Trade Organization.
据一位熟悉全球生物制药业务的业内人士称，“很多国家都有药品专利强制许可的法律，即当与公共健康相关的重大灾难发生，药品生产企业可以申请免除专利限制，由国家授权来进行仿制，这是各个国家通用的做法。
According to one industry source familiar with the global biopharmaceutical business, "many countries have laws that make drug patents compulsory, meaning that when a major public-health-related disaster occurs, drug-producing companies can apply for exemption from patent restrictions and state-authorized copying, a common practice in every country.
”事实上，上一次我国出于公共健康目的，实施专利强制许可的药品，是吉利德研发的抗病毒药物磷酸奥司他韦（Oseltamivir Phosphate，商品名“达菲”）。
Indeed, the last drug for which a patent in our country is compulsory for public health purposes was the antiviral drug Oseltamivir Phosphate (trade name "Tamiflu") developed by Geely.
磷酸奥司他韦是由吉利德研发、罗氏全球商业化的一种专利原研药，对甲型流感，乙型流感，H5N1、H9N2等亚型禽流感病毒引起的流行性感冒有治疗和预防的作用。
Oseltamivir phosphate is a proprietary drug developed by Geely and commercialized worldwide. It has therapeutic and preventive effects against influenza A, influenza B, H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes of avian influenza.
2005年流感大规模暴发时，磷酸奥司他韦一度被世界卫生组织推荐用于高致病性禽流感防治中，世界多国将其列为储备药物之一。
When the influenza pandemic broke out in 2005, oseltamivir phosphate was once recommended by the World Health Organization for use in the prevention and treatment of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
彼时，在政府强制生产许可的压力下，罗氏制药分别于2005年、2006年将磷酸奥司他韦的生产销售授权给上海医药集团和深圳市东阳光实业发展有限公司。
At that time, under the pressure of the government's compulsory production license, Roche authorized the production and sale of oseltamivir phosphate to Shanghai Pharmaceutical Group and Shenzhen East Sunshine Industry Development Co. Ltd.
根据当时的协议，两家中国企业生产的磷酸奥司他韦只能供应国家收储和政府采购，而罗氏制药的原研产品则继续在商业渠道销售。
Under the agreement, two Chinese companies produced oseltamivir phosphate only for state storage and government procurement, while Roche's original research products continued to be sold commercially.
实际上，按照制药界的国际惯例，授权生产时，授权方需向专利拥有方支付一定的“权利金”和“生产许可费”。
In fact, according to international practice in the pharmaceutical industry, when authorizing production, the authorizing party is required to pay a certain "royalty" and "production licence fee" to the patent holder.
但在通过专利强制许可方式获得磷酸奥司他韦生产、销售权的两家中国药企，对这一期间的许可费一直语焉不详。
But the licensing fees for the two Chinese pharmaceutical companies that have obtained the right to manufacture and sell oseltamivir phosphate through a compulsory patent license have been unclear.
不过，深圳市东阳光实业发展有限公司旗下的东阳光药（01558.HK）2017年2月9日披露的一份公告中称，“公司根据销售额向磷酸奥司他韦许可方支付专利费。
However, the Dongsun Medicine (01558.HK) of Shenzhen East Sunshine Industry Development Co., Ltd., disclosed on February 9, 2017, that "the company pays patent fees to Oseltamivir phosphate licensors based on sales.
控股股东获许可使用相关磷酸奥司他韦专利，直至期限届满（核心专利已于2017年到期）或已宣布无效。
Controlling shareholders are licensed to use the related oseltamivir phosphate patent until the expiry of the term (the core patent expired in 2017) or have been declared invalid.
最后一份专利将于2024年3月10日届满。
The last patent expires on 10 March 2024.
”一位不愿具名的药品专利研究人士告诉记者，近两年来，国家知识产权局和药监局就药品专利强制许可，做了具体实施细节的课题研究，但没有出台新规定。
In the past two years, the State Intellectual Property Office and the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision have been working on specific details of compulsory licensing, but no new regulations have been introduced, a pharmaceutical patent researcher who declined to be named told reporters.
现有规定源于《中华人民共和国专利法》及2012年施行的《专利实施强制许可办法》，法规细则在国家知识产权局的官网上有公示。
The existing regulations are derived from the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China and the Measures for Compulsory Licensing for the Implementation of Patents, which came into force in 2012.
记者查阅公开资料发现，2012年5月1日施行的《专利实施强制许可办法》中，第二章“强制许可请求的提出与受理”中第六条、第七条涉及公共利益及药品情况。
In the Measures on Compulsory Patent Licensing, which came into force on 1 May 2012, journalists found that articles 6 and 7 of Chapter II, "Presentation and Acceptance of Compulsory License Requests," dealt with the public interest and the situation of pharmaceuticals.
第六条规定，“在国家出现紧急状态或者非常情况时，或者为了公共利益的目的，国务院有关主管部门可以根据专利法第四十九条的规定，建议国家知识产权局给予其指定的具备实施条件的单位强制许可。
Article 6 stipulates that "In times of state of emergency or exceptional circumstances, or for the purpose of public interest, the competent department of the State Council may, in accordance with the provisions of Article 49 of the Patent Law, recommend the State Intellectual Property Office to grant a compulsory license to the entity designated by the State Intellectual Property Office.
”上述法规中提及的专利法，实为2009年10月1日施行版本，其第四十九条与上述规定基本一致。
The Patent Law referred to in the above-mentioned regulation is in effect as of October 1, 2009, and its Article 49 is basically in line with the above-mentioned provisions.
“实施药品专利强制许可的主要程序是，有企业提出申请，国家审批是否符合公共健康危机规定的条件，如果审评通过，由实施方和权利人商定许可费，然后实施，危机消除后即停止使用。
"The main procedure for enforcing compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents is for enterprises to apply, for State approval of compliance with the conditions set out in the public health crisis, and, if so, for the licensor and the right holder to agree on the licence fee, which is then implemented and then stopped after the crisis has been resolved.
如果有争议还可以提出行政诉讼”，上述药品专利研究人士说道。
If a dispute arises, an administrative lawsuit can be filed, "the drug patent researcher said.
厦门大学知识产权研究院院长林秀芹等人在《利用专利强制许可应对当前公共健康问题的建议——以新型冠状病毒（2019-CoV）疫情为例》中指出，“我国启动强制许可有两种渠道：第一，具有生产能力的企业向国家知识产权局申请强制许可；第二，公共健康主管部门建议，国家知识产权局决定向公共健康主管部门指定的单位签发强制许可。
According to Lin Xiuqin, director of the Institute of Intellectual Property at Xiamen University, and others, in his proposal to use patent licensing to address current public health problems, "Taking the new coronavirus (2019-CoV) epidemic as an example," China has two channels: first, productive enterprises apply to the State Intellectual Property Office for compulsory license.
”仿制程序存疑除专利授权外，被监管处罚的三家上市公司的商业化批量生产资质存疑。
The imitation program has doubts about the commercial mass production qualifications of the three listed companies subject to regulatory penalties, except for patent licensing.
博瑞医药2月12日披露的《关于抗病毒药物研制取得进展的公告》称，“公司成功开发了瑞德西韦原料药合成工艺和制剂技术，并已经批量生产出瑞德西韦原料药，瑞德西韦制剂批量化生产正在进行中。
"The company has successfully developed the Rhetsevir bulk drug synthesis process and formulation technology, and has mass-produced Rhetsevir bulk drug production," the company said in its February 12 announcement on progress in the development of antiviral drugs.
”海南海药2月15日公告称，“公司已经完成瑞德西韦制剂的第一批生产，并已具备年产 350 万支的规模化生产能力。
"The company has completed the first batch of Rhetsevir preparations and has a scale production capacity of 3.5 million units a year," Hainan medicine said in a statement on February 15.
”物产中大2月13日上午，在“上证 e 互动”平台回答投资者提问时称，公司控股子公司江苏科本药业有限公司的“抗新型冠状病毒肺炎特效药瑞德西韦10T/制剂1000万支”项目处于政府行政审批备案后开工前阶段。
In response to questions from investors on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Interactive platform on the morning of February 13, the company's holding subsidiary Jiangsu Copperhead Pharmaceuticals Ltd. said the project, "Rhetsevir 10T / formulation 10m tablets," is in the pre-construction stage after government administrative approval and filing.
某药企医药研究院负责人告诉记者，一般情况下，仿制药研究申报流程包括至少八个步骤，分别是：一、确定参比制剂（即“被仿制的原研药或同类仿制药”）；二、获得权利人的专利授权；三、向药审中心提交参比制剂遴选申请；四、进行非临床研究，包括处方工艺研究（小试初步验证工艺、中试验证工艺、适用于商业化生产的大规模生产验证工艺）、质量研究、稳定性研究、药理毒理研究；五、向药监局递交药品临床试验申请；六、进行临床生物等效性实验；七、接受现场核查（包括动态三批现场工艺检查，以确认全部工艺过程符合提交的注册工艺）；八、临床试验数据合格后，申请药品注册上市批件。
Under normal circumstances, the filing process for generic research includes at least eight steps, namely: (i) determining the reference preparation (i.e. "generic or generic"); (ii) obtaining patent authorization from the owner; (iii) conducting clinical bioequivalence studies; (vi) conducting clinical bioequivalence studies; (v) conducting clinical bioequivalence studies; (v) conducting clinical bioequivalence tests; (h) conducting clinical trials.
根据交易所的监管处罚文件所述，博瑞医药、物产中大进行的瑞德西韦研制，均属于非临床研究阶段。
According to the regulatory punishment documents of the exchange, the development of Rhetsevier by BORI and Rhetsevir is a non-clinical research stage.
具体地，博瑞医药正在进行的是，瑞德西韦研发中小试、中试等批次的试验性生产。
In particular, what BORI is doing is developing pilot production of pilot and pilot batches of Rhetsevier.
物产中大子公司进行的，则是瑞德西韦研制的项目立项备案（包括产品研发、临床试验阶段）。
The major subsidiary of the product is Rhetsevier development of the project record (including product development, clinical trials phase).
记者从某药企研发事业部项目管理部总监处了解到，仿制药研发的前期准备中，都会采购参比制剂及原料，在实验室条件下用实验系统进行试验，包括处方工艺摸索、小规模试生产验证工艺、中试生产及工艺验证以及评价药物安全性、稳定性有关的其他试验。
From the Director of Project Management, Research and Development Division of a pharmaceutical company, the reporter has learned that reference preparations and raw materials are purchased in advance of the development of generic drugs. Experiments are conducted in laboratory conditions using experimental systems, including prescription trial runs, small-scale trial production validation, pilot production and process validation, and other tests related to the evaluation of drug safety and stability.
一般来说，这些试验产品不涉及商业化生产、销售，所以不在原研药专利维权机制内。
Generally speaking, these experimental products do not involve commercial production, sales, so it is not in the original patent protection mechanism.
根据国家药监局2019年3月发布的《化学仿制药参比制剂遴选与确定程序》规定，仿制药生产及研发企业在研究前，应通过参比制剂遴选申请平台向国家药监局药品审评中心提出申请。
According to the Procedures for Selection and Determination of Chemical Generics Reference Formula issued by the State Administration of Pharmacy in March 2019, manufacturers of generic medicines and research and development enterprises should apply to the Drug Review Center of the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Administration through the reference preparation selection application platform prior to the research.
记者查询国家药监局药品审评中心平台上的公示信息，未发现与瑞德西韦相关的参比制剂申请登记。
The reporter inquired about the public information on the platform of the Drug Evaluation Center of the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration and did not find any reference preparations related to Rhetsevir to apply for registration.
《化学仿制药参比制剂遴选与确定程序》规定，仿制的原研药品主要由以下几类：一是国内上市的原研药品，二是经审核确定的国外原研企业在中国境内生产或经技术转移生产的药品，三是未进口原研药品。
The Procedures for Selection and Determination of Chemical Generics Reference Preparation stipulate that the primary research pharmaceuticals manufactured under imitation include the following categories: first, domestically-listed original research drugs, secondly, medicines produced or transferred within China by foreign research enterprises as determined by the audit, and, thirdly, non-imported raw pharmaceuticals.
上述熟悉全球生物制药业务的业内人士分析指出，国内药企如果要合规仿制瑞德西韦，那很可能是通过吉利德公司技术转移授权给中国药企进行仿制。
The analysis, by industry insiders familiar with the global biopharmaceutical business, suggests that if domestic companies are to comply with Rhetsevier's imitation, it is likely to be licensed to Chinese pharmaceutical companies through Geely's technology transfer.
如果是通过技术转移渠道来做瑞德西韦的仿制药，获得授权的中国药企，只需要在预备生产瑞德西韦的工厂进行稳定性研究，通过试验了解制剂在温度、湿度、光线照射等各种环境因素的影响下的变化，经过药监部门现场工艺检查合格后，才能最终向药监局申报上市，再投入生产。
If Rhettiver's generic drugs are made through technology transfer channels, authorized Chinese pharmaceutical companies only need to conduct stability studies at the plant that is preparing to produce Rhetsevir. Experiments to understand changes in the formulation under the influence of various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, light exposure, etc. Only after passing the on-site technical examination by the pharmaceutical supervisory department can they finally report to the Drug Administration for listing and re-entry into production.
“学徒能否出师要通过考试。
"Apprentices can pass examinations.
”该业内人士说道。
"said the industry insider.
据悉，瑞德西韦抗新型冠状病毒的两项临床试验目前仍在武汉进行，受试者在陆续入组。
It is reported that Rhetsevir anti-new coronavirus two clinical trials are still under way in Wuhan, the participants in a series of groups.
两项试验的设计完成时间分别在4月底和5月初。
The design completion dates for the two trials were in late April and early May, respectively.
