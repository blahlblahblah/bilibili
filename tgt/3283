谁都无法准确预测危机何时到来，尤其科技类公司，保持抵御风险能力与开拓新市场两大能力非常重要。
No one can predict exactly when a crisis will strike, and it is important for technology companies, in particular, to remain resilient and tap into new markets.
股市下行之际，唯有充裕的现金流能够帮助企业抵御风险刘以秦 陈潇潇 | 文谢丽容 | 编辑Barrons Alvaro Dominguez 制图提要点：1. 科技创新是当下经济发展的主赛道，也是过去数年中美股市上涨的主要获利者，美股持续上涨了11年，中国股市上，科技股也连续上涨了2年。
When the stock market is down, only ample cash flow can help companies weather risks. & nbsp; Edit Barrons Alvaro Dominguez: 1. Technological innovation is the main track of economic development and the main gainer of U.S. stock market gains in the past few years.
美股大跌，科技行业的发展不可避免受到影响。
U. S. stocks fell sharply, the development of the technology industry is inevitably affected.
2. 美股熔断后，美国五大科技公司中，苹果公司的跌幅最大，市值缩水996亿美元。
After the meltdown, Apple fell the most among the top five U.S. technology companies, losing $99.6 billion in market value.
3. 在美股上市还有不少中国科技公司，中概股的表现会略强于美国科技公司，原因是它们依托于中国市场，有收入保障。
3.There are also many Chinese technology companies listed on US stock exchanges, and the Chinese stocks will outperform US technology companies slightly because of their reliance on the Chinese market and their income security.
4. 美股下跌短期内对A股影响有限。
The fall in US stocks will have limited impact on A shares in the short term.
A股不跟外盘走，美股上涨的11年期间A股波动并不明显。
A shares do not go with the outside, the United States shares rose during the 11-year period A-shares volatility is not obvious.
5. A股之所以目前走势相对独立，是因为最近居民储蓄转移, 新老基建发力等政策都在相继铺开。
A shares are relatively independent because of the recent shift in household savings and the deployment of new and old infrastructure.
这尤其利好中国科技公司。
This is especially good for Chinese technology companies.
6. 回购股份、稳定股价可以支撑企业渡过艰难的市场周期。
Share buybacks and price stability can prop up companies through difficult market cycles.
但谁都无法准确预测危机何时到来，尤其科技类公司，保持抵御风险能力与开拓新市场两大能力非常重要。
But no one can predict exactly when a crisis will strike, and it is important, especially for technology companies, to maintain resilience and tap new markets.
受到新冠病毒蔓延和石油价格战的双重影响，美国东部时间3月9日上午9时34分，美国三大股指跌幅均超7%，触发熔断。
At 9: 34 a.m. EDT, three major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 7 percent, triggering a meltdown, affected by the spread of the new cap virus and the oil price war.
所谓熔断机制，通俗地说，就是当股市跌到一定幅度之后，市场自动停止交易一段时间，可能是几分钟，也可能是全天交易就此终止。
The so-called fusing mechanism, colloquially, is when the stock market reaches a certain level and the market automatically stops trading for a period of time, either for a few minutes or for a full day.
这样做的主要目的就是，防范恐慌情绪进一步扩散给市场带来更大的冲击。
The main purpose of this is to prevent panic from spreading further and bringing more shocks to the market.
美国在1987年的“黑色星期一”的3个月之后推出了股指熔断机制，分为7％，13％，20％的三档下跌熔断。
Three months after Black Monday in 1987, the U.S. introduced the stock-index fusion mechanism, which splits 7%, 13% and 20% of the way down.
三十多年来的美股市场，这次之前，美股真正触发熔断仅有一次：1997年10月27日，道琼斯工业指数暴跌7.18％，收于7161.15点，那次创下自1915年以来最大跌幅。
The three-decade-old U.S. stock market followed only one real meltdown: on October 27, 1997, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 7.18% to 7161.15, the biggest drop since 1915.
3月9日，投资者再次见证历史。
On March 9, investors once again saw history.
受美股大盘影响，占据龙头地位的美国科技股持续下跌，截止3月10日收盘，Facebook下跌6.4%，亚马逊下跌5.29%，苹果下跌7.91%，谷歌下跌6.17%，奈飞下跌6.09%。
Leading U.S. technology stocks continued to tumble, with Facebook down 6.4%, Amazon down 5.29%, Apple down 7.91%, Google down 6.17% and Naifei down 6.09% by March 10.
五家最有价值的科技巨头市值一夜间缩水了3216亿美元。
The value of the five most valuable technology giants fell by $321.6 billion overnight.
在美股上市的中国科技公司也受到波及，其中阿里巴巴下跌3.45%，百度下跌6.23%，京东下跌5.34%，蔚来下跌7.04%。
US-listed Chinese technology companies were also affected, with Alibaba down 3.45 per cent, Baidu down 6.23 per cent and Jingdong down 5.34 per cent, down 7.04 per cent.
科技创新是当下经济发展的主赛道，过去一年，中美在科技领域展开竞争，包括5G、芯片、人工智能等。
Technology innovation is now the main circuit of economic development, the past year, China and the United States in the field of technology, including 5G, chip, artificial intelligence, and so on.
科技股也是过去数年中美股市上涨的主要获利者，美股持续上涨了11年，中国股市上，科技股也连续上涨了2年。
Technology stocks have also been the main gainers of the U.S. stock market rally over the past few years, with U.S. stocks continuing to rise for 11 years and Chinese stocks rising for two consecutive years.
美股大跌，科技行业的发展不可避免受到影响。
U. S. stocks fell sharply, the development of the technology industry is inevitably affected.
天灏资本(T.H. Capital)创始人侯晓天告诉《财经》记者，股市下行之际，唯有充裕的现金流能够帮助企业抵御风险。
Hou Xiaotian, founder of T. H. Capital, told Caijing that only ample cash flow can help companies weather risks as the stock market falls.
美科技股11年牛市将终结？南方基金首席策略分析师杨德龙告诉《财经》记者，此次熔断，对于美国的大多数股票都影响巨大，对于科技股的影响尤其大，因为科技股过去十年涨幅非常大，获利最多。
The 11-year bull market in U.S. tech stocks will end? The meltdown has had a huge impact on most U.S. stocks, especially tech stocks, which have gained the most money over the past decade, Yang Dalong, chief strategic analyst for the South Fund, told Caijing.
美股已经连续上涨了11年，多位资本市场分析人士告诉《财经》记者，到了该调整的时刻了。
U.S. stocks have risen for 11 years in a row, and several capital-market analysts told Caijing it was time for a correction.
这是合理的调整阶段，但同时叠加新冠疫情的全球蔓延，可能会让市场陷入恐慌。
This is a reasonable phase of adjustment, but at the same time the global spread of the new crown epidemic may send the market into panic.
此次美国五大科技公司中，苹果公司的跌幅最大，市值缩水996亿美元。
Apple suffered the biggest drop of all of America's top five technology companies, losing $99.6 billion in market value.
美国五大科技公司中，苹果是唯一一家硬件消费类公司。
Apple is the only hardware consumer company among the top five U. S. technology companies.
当然，如果将苹果股市行情下跌的的板子完全打在美国大盘上，这并不公允。
Of course, it would not be fair if the board that sent Apple's stock market down were to hit the U. S. market entirely.
今年2月18日，苹果公司就宣布，受疫情影响，全球iPhone供应紧张，此前发布的第二财季的营收目标630-670亿美元无法实现。
On Feb. 18, Apple announced that global iPhone supplies were tight because of the epidemic, and it had previously announced revenue targets of $63 billion to $67 billion for the second quarter.
2月1日-2月9日，苹果关闭中国大陆所有零售店整整9天，截止3月10日，38家中国大陆苹果零售店恢复营业，营业时间限制在11点到18点（正常营业时间为10点到22点），还有4家仍处于关门状态，包括天津和苏州的门店，苹果公司并未对外公布具体原因。
From Feb. 1 to Feb. 9, Apple closed all retail stores in mainland China for nine days. As of March 10, 38 Apple stores in mainland China were open between 11 and 18 (normal business hours are between 10 and 22), while four others remained closed, including stores in Tianjin and Suzhou, for which Apple did not disclose the reasons.
受到疫情影响，苹果公司不仅销售难，生产也难，包括富士康在内的多家苹果供应链公司还未能完全复工。
Apple is not only hard to sell but also difficult to produce because of the epidemic, and many Apple supply-chain companies, including Foxconn, have yet to get back to work.
在中国疫情即将进入尾声之时，美股熔断又给了苹果另一重打击。
As China nears the end of the epidemic, the meltdown has dealt another blow to Apple.
侯晓天的观点是，资本市场下跌，经济活动放缓，会影响到个人消费，“刚需类的个人消费不会受到太大影响，高价电子产品的消费会受打击。
Mr Hou argues that falling capital markets and slowing economic activity will hurt personal consumption, "just-in-demand personal consumption will not be affected too much and high-priced electronics will suffer."
”一位中金公司分析人士告诉《财经》记者，科技公司的业务模式各不相同，“纯线上消费且客单价不高的，影响较小，苹果受到的影响会很大。
One CICC analyst told Caijing that the technology companies have different business models and that "Apple will be hit hard by pure-line consumption and low unit prices."
”除了消费电子，以谷歌、Facebook为代表的美国科技公司，主要收入来自广告，侯晓天认为，广告主会受到股市下行，经济活动收缩的影响，缩减广告开支。
Apart from consumer electronics, US technology companies such as Google and Facebook, which generate most of their revenue from advertising, Mr Hou believes advertisers will be hit by a downturn in the stock market and a contraction in economic activity, cutting advertising spending.
近年来，科技公司的主航道开始向科技赋能转移，主要面向需要做新技术改造的行业客户，包括人工智能、大数据、云计算等。
In recent years, technology companies have begun to shift their main shipping lanes to technology, targeting industry customers who need to make new technological changes, including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, etc.
这一新兴业务同样会受到客户缩减开支的影响。
The new business will also be hit by cutbacks in customer spending.
除了美国科技公司，在美股上市还有不少中国科技公司，包括阿里巴巴、百度、京东、携程等。
In addition to US technology companies, there are also many Chinese technology companies listed in the United States, including Alibaba, Baidu, Jingdong, Ctrip, etc.
杨德龙认为，中概股的表现会略强于美国科技公司，原因是它们依托于中国市场，有收入保障。
Mr Yang thinks the equity stakes will outperform US technology companies slightly because they are income-secure because of their reliance on the Chinese market.
对于中概股公司来说，一个潜在的风险是，美国资本市场会减少对中国公司的投资。
There is a potential risk that US capital markets will reduce investment in Chinese companies.
美国海银资本首席策略官陈凯丰近期参加了不少美国金融行业的活动，发现不少美国投资机构的高层人士都对中国有微词，他判断，“疫情蔓延，不光是美国，全球各国可能都会减少对中国的投资，普通投资者会减少购买中国公司的股票。
Chen Kaifeng, chief strategist at Silver Capital, recently joined a number of events in the US financial industry and found that many senior figures in US investment agencies were critical of China. He concluded that "the epidemic is not just spreading in the US, but the world is likely to reduce investment in China and the average investor will buy less shares in Chinese companies."
A股短期影响不大相比几乎一片全绿的美股及中概股，A股表现平稳得多。
A-share short-term impact compared to almost all-green U. S. stocks and mid-stock, A-share performance much more stable.
3月10日开盘，上证指数涨幅0.5%左右，其他两个指数的涨幅略高于上证指数。
The Shanghai index was up about 0.5 per cent when it opened March 10, while the other two were up slightly more than the Shanghai index.
综合多位投资人的观点，美股下跌短期内对A股影响有限。
Combined with the views of many investors, the U. S. stock decline short-term impact on A shares.
一位券商人士告诉《财经》记者，虽然疫情引发了全球范围内的资金流动性危机，但A股不跟外盘走，美股上涨的11年期间A股波动并不明显。
A broker told Caijing that while the outbreak triggered a liquidity crisis around the world, Class A shares did not follow the offer, and volatility in A shares during the 11-year rise in U.S. stocks was not significant.
此外，目前油价处于低位，有利于经济复苏和货币政策灵活性，增加了降息空间，对A股而言其实更加有利。
In addition, the current low oil prices, which are conducive to economic recovery and monetary policy flexibility, have increased the scope for interest rate cuts and are actually more favourable for A-shares.
一位二级市场投资人对《财经》记者表示，A股之所以目前走势相对独立，是因为最近居民储蓄转移, 新老基建发力等政策都在相继铺开。
A secondary market investor told Caijing that the A-share trend is relatively independent because of the recent shift in household savings, new and old infrastructure capacity and so on.
这尤其利好中国科技公司。
This is especially good for Chinese technology companies.
政府正在源源不断的为科技行业提供有利政策，并启动了高达25万亿以上的基建计划。
The government is providing a steady stream of enabling policies for the technology sector and has launched infrastructure projects worth more than $25 trillion.
相对于美股和中概股，A股目前的稳定性较好，尤其是科技股。
A-shares are now more stable than U.S. stocks and mid-capitalization stocks, especially technology stocks.
今年春节假期后恢复交易以来，A股科技股大幅上行。
A-share technology stocks have jumped since trading resumed after this spring holiday.
尤其是5G、半导体、新能源汽车等领域。
Especially in the field of 5G, semiconductor, new energy vehicle and so on.
今年2月末，工信部召开电视电话会议，一个重要议题是加快推进5G发展，做好信息通信业复工复产工作。
In late February, the Ministry of Industry and Communications held a teleconference. An important agenda was to speed up the 5G development and get the information and communications industry back to work.
此后，5G概念全线大涨。
Since then, the 5G concept has soared.
其中，中兴通讯涨停，股价创历史新高50.11元，年内已累涨41%；其他涨停的还有宜通世纪、路通视讯、广和通、武汉凡谷、奥维通信、烽火通信和通宇通讯等。
Among them, ZTE rose to an all-time high of 50.11 yuan, up 41% this year. Other trading included Yitong Century, Pascom Video, Kwong Wo Tong, Van Gogh Wuhan, Orvey Communications, Beacon Communication and Tong Yu Communication.
多数投资人对《财经》记者表示，过去两年A股科技股一直处于牛市状态，累计涨幅较大，估值普遍偏高，如果结合这个因素，长期来看，全球股市大跌依然会引发这些股票的调整。
If combined with the fact that A-share technology stocks have been in a bull market for the past two years, with large aggregate gains and generally high valuations, most investors told Caijing, a sharp fall in global equity markets would still trigger a correction in these stocks over the long term.
“因为外盘跌了，所以A股成了避风港，这个逻辑其实很弱。
"Because the outside offer fell, so A shares became a safe haven, this logic is actually very weak.
”一位投资人对《财经》表示。
One investor told Caijing.
上述投资者认为，受疫情影响，投资者的风险偏好降低，会更加谨慎。
These investors believe that the epidemic will affect investors less risk preferences, will be more cautious.
这意味着，如果将观察维度放到更长期，会加速这些科技股的分化，“也就是好的涨、坏的跌，完全看业绩了。
This means that if you put the observation dimension into the longer term, it will accelerate the divergence of these tech stocks, "that is to say, good and bad, depending on performance."
”前述中金公司分析师则提到，如果全球性需求不足，中国的进出口类科技公司也会受到很大影响，而且，“中国早晚也会面临像美国一样需求不足、贫富差距扩大、债务水平过高的问题。
Analysts at CICC mentioned earlier that China's import and export technology companies would also be badly affected if global demand were to fall short, and that "sooner or later China will face the same problems as the US of insufficient demand, a widening gap between rich and poor and excessive debt levels."
”杨德龙认为，对于科技股而言，主要看的是未来业绩增长，而这取决于技术、管理、研发等优势能否帮助企业在未来释放业绩。
Mr Yang thinks the main focus for tech stocks is future growth, which depends on whether technology, management and research and development help unleash earnings in the future.
如果仅仅是炒概念或者技术上无法突破，不能打开市场，股价还会跌回去。
If only the concept or technology can not break through, can not open the market, stock prices will fall back.
充足现金流是抵御短期风险的良药对于企业来说，资本市场波动最大的影响就是募资渠道收缩。
Adequate cash flow is the antidote to short-term risk. For companies, the biggest impact of capital market volatility is the contraction of fundraising channels.
此外，疫情蔓延会让部分行业的收入受到打击，此时，企业现金流能力至关重要。
In addition, the spread of the epidemic will hit revenue in some sectors, at a time when corporate cash flow capacity is crucial.
杨德龙认为，包括苹果在内的美国科技巨头，账上有大量现金，为保持短期内稳定股价，可能会加大回购自家股票。
Mr. Yang believes the U.S. technology giants, including Apple, have large amounts of cash on their books and may buy back more of their own shares to keep stock prices stable in the short term.
而且，过去十年这些科技龙头股涨幅很大，储备了大量流动资金。
And, over the past decade, these tech champions have risen sharply, hoarding a lot of liquidity.
公司回购股票是一项常规操作。
Repurchase of shares by the company is a routine operation.
一般来说，公司会在股价被低估的时候回购股票，对于大型巨头而言，这是一种很有效的股东回报手段。
In general, companies buy back shares when they are undervalued, which is an effective way for big giants to reciprocate.
“现在价格低，回购便宜，比较划算。
"It's cheaper to buy it back now because it's cheap.
”杨德龙表示。
Mr Yang said.
公司加速回购股票，也有助于抵消对增长放缓的担忧。
Accelerated share repurchases by companies also helped to offset concerns about slowing growth.
整个2019年，苹果在股票回购上花费了660多亿美元，是微软、谷歌、亚马逊以及脸书的综合的三倍。
Throughout 2019, Apple spent more than $66 billion on share buybacks, three times more than Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook combined.
分析人士普遍认为，苹果股票回购股票的用意是为了抵消增长疲软。
Analysts generally believe Apple's stock buybacks are intended to offset weak growth.
这期间iPhone作为苹果的支撑型业务，依然持续放缓。
The iPhone continued to slow during this period as Apple's mainstay business.
苹果2019年第3财季净利润为100.44亿美元，较上年同期的115.19亿美元下降13%。
Apple reported a net profit of $10.044 billion for the third quarter of 2019, down 13% from $11.519 billion a year earlier.
其中，收入占比最大的iPhone销售收入为259.9亿美元，较上年同期的294.70亿美元下降12%，收入占比为48.3%，首次低于50%。
Sales of the iPhone, the largest component of revenue, fell 12% to $25.99 billion from $29.470 billion a year earlier, while revenue accounted for 48.3%, down from 50% for the first time.
不仅仅是苹果，从2018年3季度开始，科技巨头们已经开始了回购潮。
Apple isn't the only company that has had a buyback boom since the third quarter of 2018.
据第三方企业财务信息机构S&P Capital IQ发布的数据统计，2018年第3季度到2019年第3季度，20家科技公司在股票回购的资本支出上超过2610亿美元，是美股股票回购最活跃的领域。
Between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019, 20 technology companies spent more than $261 billion on share buybacks, according to S & amp; P Capital IQ, a third-party financial information firm.
回购股份、稳定股价也可以支撑企业渡过艰难的市场周期。
Repurchase of shares and stabilisation of share prices can also prop up companies through difficult market cycles.
阿里巴巴和百度现金流状况良好。
Alibaba and Baidu cash flow is good.
财报数据显示，截至2019年12月31日，百度有现金、现金等价物、限制性资金及短期投资共1359亿元人民币，自由现金流101亿元人民币。
As of December 31, 2019, Baidu had 135.9 billion yuan in cash, cash equivalents, restricted funds and short-term investments, with free cash flow of 10.1 billion yuan, according to the results.
同期，阿里巴巴现金、现金等价物和短期投资金额达到3519亿元人民币，较上一季度上涨约1200亿元人民币，主要原因是11月底在香港上市，募资超过900亿元人民币。
During the same period, Alibaba's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments reached 351.9 billion yuan, up about Rmb120bn from the previous quarter, mainly because it raised more than Rmb90bn in Hong Kong at the end of November.
京东的现金流能力相对较弱，财报显示， 京东2019年全年营收为5769亿元，同比增长24.9%，自由现金流增长至195亿元。
The company's cash flow capacity is relatively weak, with profit results showing annual revenue of 576.9 billion yuan, up 24.9 percent year on year, with free cash flow rising to 19.5 billion yuan.
京东是重资产公司，依赖现金周转，因此不会预留太多现金。
Jingdong is a heavy asset company, dependent on cash flow, so will not reserve too much cash.
不过疫情对京东这类电商平台有正面刺激。
However, the outbreak of such electrical business platforms such as Jingdong has a positive stimulus.
2020年3月3日，京东零售集团CEO徐雷在财报会议上表示，“京东自营模式在这次疫情当中相对来说表现非常好。
On March 3, 2020, Xu Lei, CEO of Jingdong Retail Group, told the Financial Reporting Meeting: "The Beijing-East self-operation model has performed relatively well in the face of the epidemic.
”并预计，今年一季度净收入同比将增长10%以上。
Net income is expected to grow by more than 10 per cent year on year in the first quarter.
3月6日，老虎证券发布报告称， 依托自建物流配送体系，京东成为疫情下少数能保证用户正常下单配送的电商平台。
On March 6, Tiger Securities issued a report, relying on the self-built logistics distribution system, Jingdong has become an epidemic under the few can ensure the normal distribution of customers under the electric business platform.
还有一些科技公司正在各种想方设法缓解现金流压力。
Still others are trying to find ways to ease cash flow pressures.
以携程为代表的旅游行业公司，受疫情冲击巨大，3月9日，携程集团CEO孙洁发布员工内部信称，从本月开始，她和携程集团联合创始人、董事局主席梁建章开始0薪，同时公司高管层也提出自愿降薪，最低半薪，直至行业恢复；其他员工暂缓涨薪。
China Travel Industry Co., represented by Ctrip, was hit hard by the epidemic, with Ctrip Group CEO Sun Jie releasing an internal staff letter on March 9 saying that starting this month, she and Ctrip Co-Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors had been offering a voluntary pay cut with half pay until the industry recovers.
疫情爆发初期孙洁对外表示，携程电话呼入量增长了一二十倍，上亿人次退订，公司退款垫资超10亿量级。
At the beginning of the outbreak, Sun Jie said the volume of Ctrip phone incoming calls increased by a factor of one to 20, with hundreds of millions of cancellations and corporate refunds of more than 1 billion orders of magnitude.
3月5日，携程推出“预约未来旅行”预售产品，携程CMO孙波在发布会上表示，希望通过预售的方式帮助产业链上的合作伙伴提前回流现金，度过疫情带来的最艰难时期。
On March 5, Ctrip launched a "pre-sale booking travel" products, Ctrip CMO Sun Bo said in the press conference, hope to help partners in the industry chain through the pre-sale cash reflux, through the most difficult period of the epidemic.
3月9日，携程股价下跌9.18%，市值158亿美元。
On March 9, Ctrip shares fell 9.18% to $15.8 billion.
截至2019年9月30日，携程网的现金、现金等价物、限制性现金及短期投资余额为人民币610亿元（约合85亿美元），截至目前还未发布四季度的财报。
As of September 30, 2019, Ctrip had a balance of 61 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, with no fourth-quarter results yet.
新技术需要持续投资，为了能够快速发展业务，抢占市场，不少科技公司在过去几年都选择增加投入，或是用补贴来吸引新客户。
New technologies require continued investment, and many tech companies have in the past few years opted to invest more or use subsidies to attract new customers in order to be able to grow quickly and capture the market.
在资本市场资金充裕，或是现金流业务表现稳定时，这样的做法可以增加先发优势。
When capital markets are flush with capital, or cash-flow businesses are stable, such an approach can add a first-mover advantage.
但危机何时到来，谁也无法准确预测，保持抵御风险能力与开拓新市场同样重要。
But no one can predict precisely when a crisis will strike, and maintaining resilience is as important as tapping new markets.
