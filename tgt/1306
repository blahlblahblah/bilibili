I'm Battle of Pneumonia in Wuhan, "" My Vagrancy "Spring Festival," Pneumonia in the Country ".
作者 | 黎明 闫丽娇 孔明明金玙璠孟亚娜 唐亚华 苏琦 赵磊编辑 |凌远川今天是正月初七，本来应该是春节后全国人民开工的日子，但因为新型肺炎，大部分人的假期被延长至初十（或更晚）。
Yan Yan-ya Hua Suqi Zhao Lei at the beginning of the seventh day of the first month, which should be the start date for the whole nation after the Spring Festival. But because of the new type of pneumonia, most people's holidays are extended to the tenth (or later).
不过，还是有那么一些人，或出于对工作的热爱，或担心回不了北京，或想赶在老家封城之前“出逃”，他们匆匆买好了回北京的车票，想要提前回到工作城市。
Still, there are those who rush to buy their return tickets to Beijing and return to work early, either out of love for their jobs or afraid they won't get back to Beijing or want to "run away" before their hometown is closed.
然而，这些提前返京或正打算返京的人，突然惊讶地发现，回去并没有那么容易。
However, those who returned to Beijing early or were planning to return to Beijing were suddenly surprised to find that it was not so easy to return.
北京市政府官网1月30日发布《北京市新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情社区(村)防控工作方案(试行)》，要求实施群防群治、联防联控，网格化、地毯式管理，对返(来)京人员进行分类管控，督促其他疫情高发地区来(返)京人员主动自行隔离14天。
Beijing Municipal Government on January 30 issued the "Beijing New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Community (Pilot) Program," called for the implementation of group control, joint control, grid, blanket management, back to Beijing personnel control, urging other high-incidence areas to come to Beijing to voluntarily isolate themselves for 14 days.
确诊数量还在提升。
The number of diagnoses is increasing.
截至1月30日24时，全国31省（区、市）和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告确诊新型肺炎病例9692例（四川省累计确诊病例核减1例），疑似病例15238例，累计治愈171人，累计死亡213人。
As of 2400 hours on January 30, a cumulative total of 9,692 new cases of pneumonia (1 case of confirmed cases in Sichuan Province) had been reported by 31 provinces (districts, cities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and 15,238 suspected cases had been cured, with a cumulative total of 213 deaths.
在疫情扩散、防控升级的背景下，对于北京这样的超大型城市而言，迎接返京大潮是一个艰巨任务。
Against the background of the spread of the epidemic and the escalation of prevention and control, it is a difficult task for a mega-city like Beijing to meet the tide of returning to Beijing.
有人在外地收到了北京房东发来的短信，被通知所有外地返京人员及车辆都不能进村；有人在外地得知自己在北京的小区已被封锁，不得已退掉了返京的车票；有人回京了被拦在小区门外；还有人在老家被父母阻止回京，说大不了就辞职在家考事业单位。
Some people received a text message from the landlord in Beijing and were told that no one from Beijing could enter the village. Some people were told that their small area in Beijing had been blocked and had to return their tickets to Beijing. Some returned to Beijing to be barred from the community.
在这样的特殊时期，从城市返乡后，如今是否返京、什么时候返京、如何返京，成为了一个问题。
In such a special period, from the urban return home, whether to return to Beijing, when to return to Beijing, how to return to Beijing, has become a problem.
回北京住所前要先去市医院开具健康证明担心被交叉感染但也愿意接受吕强 27岁 市场BD我本来订的是2月1号的返程高铁票，但昨天（1月30日）早上7点的时候，收到了房东发给我的村委会发布的紧急通知，说从1月29日20:00起，所有外地返京人员及车辆都不能进村，必须在外面隔离14天、并出示在京14天身体健康证明，才能进村。
Before returning to my residence in Beijing, I had to go to the city hospital to issue a health certificate fearing cross-infection but also accept Lu Qiang's 27-year-old market.
北京白庙村村委会发布的紧急通知来源/受访者收到通知后，我赶紧给房东打了一个电话，询问具体情况，房东当时回复我说，他会去村委会开会，商量是否能让我们到北京当地医院开具身体健康证明。
After receiving the notification from the source / interviewee of the emergency notice issued by the village committee of Baimiao Village in Beijing, I called the landlord immediately to enquire about the details. The landlord told me that he would go to the village committee to discuss whether we could go to the local hospital in Beijing to issue a certificate of good health.
我在公司群里跟领导反应了一下情况，他们临时开会决定，可能会给我们这些返程比较困难的员工提供宿舍等便利，因为现在北京的很多宾馆和旅店也不让外来人员入住。
I had a meeting with the leaders of the company and decided that it might be possible to provide accommodation and other facilities for those of us with more difficult return journeys, as many hotels and inns in Beijing are now out of bounds to outsiders.
下午两点钟，我们收到了村委会的通知：如果确实需要回京，需要本人到北京市医院做新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎检查，开具身体健康证明，方可进村。
At 2: 00 pm, we received a notice from the village committee that if we really need to go back to Beijing, we need to go to Beijing Hospital for a pneumonia test for a new coronavirus infection and issue a certificate of good health before entering the village.
村委会紧急开会之后的最新通知来源/受访者我老家是哈尔滨市下面的一个村子，我是1月23号回的老家。
www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cn www.youtheme.cnMy hometown is a village below Harbin city.
从北京回家的时候我买了很多口罩和消毒液，在家也会时不时地监测下体温。
I bought a lot of masks and disinfectant when I got home from Beijing, and I monitored my temperature at home from time to time.
我们村子比较小，总共100多人，基本都是从北京、山东等省市回来的，目前问题不大。
Our village is relatively small, a total of more than 100 people, are basically from Beijing, Shandong and other provinces and cities back, the current problem is not big.
现在我就希望能够返京回到我住的地方，我可以自我隔离、不与外界接触、线上办公。
Now I want to be able to go back to Beijing and go back to where I live. I can isolate myself, stay away from the outside world and work online.
公司虽然已经通知开工延迟，但到2月3日马上也要开始工作，我不想影响自己的工作。
The company has given notice of the delay, but I don't want to interfere with my work, which will start on February 3.
我也有想过推迟回京，但如果大家都推迟的话，公司可能就会比较艰难，一些客户可能也要放弃，影响比较大，最好还是能正常工作。
I also thought about postponing my return to Beijing, but if we all put it off, the company might have a hard time, and some customers might have to give up.
我是做市场BD的，现在这种情况会更多用网销和电销的方式进行工作。
I do the market BD, now this kind of situation will use the net sale and the electricity sale way to work more.
根据村委会的通知，虽然担心去医院会有被交叉感染的风险，但我觉得能开健康证明也可以，这样对白庙村现在居住的人来说，也更安全一些，是对双方都负责的一个表现。
According to the village council notice, although there is a risk of cross-infection if we go to the hospital, I think it is possible to issue a health certificate, which is safer for the people who live in Baishimaocun and is a sign of responsibility to both sides.
返京人员禁止入内未离京也要办临时出入证宋辞 24岁互联网公司销售我在北京工作两年了，租住在北京市昌平区北七家镇平西府村里的小区，原本计划1月31号返京，票已经买好了。
I have been working in Beijing for two years and I have rented a small area in a village of seven Zhenping Xifu, north of Changping District, Beijing. I had planned to return to Beijing on January 31 and my tickets have been bought.
30号房东在微信群里通知房客：返京人员一律不让进村，需要到北京清华长庚医院开健康证明，在指定地点隔离14天。
30 landlord in the micro-letter group to inform tenants: Returnees are not allowed to enter the village, need to Beijing Tsinghua Changpong Hospital issued a health certificate, isolation in designated locations for 14 days.
也就是说，现在外地人员回京也不让回家，没有地方住，甚至可能在医院隔离。
In other words, people from outside the city are not allowed to return to Beijing, have no place to live, and may even be isolated in hospitals.
我犹豫再三，把票退了。
After much hesitation, I returned the ticket.
我认为，现在村子里对外地人的这些要求，就一个目的：禁止返京。
In my opinion, these demands on foreigners in the village now serve one purpose: to prohibit their return to Beijing.
其实，平西府村不只针对外地返京人员，对未离京人员一样严格管控。
In fact, Pingxi Province Village is not only for the return of foreign personnel, not leaving the Beijing personnel as strict control.
“返京潮”马上开始了，30号村里紧急发了通知，外地返京人员禁止入村，未离京人员要办理临时出入证。
"Back to Beijing Tide" began immediately, the village 30 issued an urgent notice, non-residents prohibited from entering the village, not to leave Beijing personnel to obtain a temporary pass.
据说，现在但凡出村，都会被问询缘由，举个例子，如果是出去买菜，会限定回村时间，晚回来还不行。
For example, if you go out to buy some vegetables, you may limit your time back to your village.
平西府村发布的通知 来源 / 受访者我是1月20号回老家黑龙江哈尔滨的，路上一切都没问题，现在老家这边也封道了，正常客运不通车，想出来只能坐黑车，原来车费50元现在黑车涨到了200元，整整翻了4倍，即便是这个价格，很多黑车也不愿意拉。
I returned to Harbin in Heilongjiang Province on January 20th and everything is fine on the way home. Now it is closed on this side of the country. The normal passenger traffic is not open to traffic.
房东说这两天村里的“政策”一时一变，唯一能确定的就是，不让外地返京人员回去，其他具体情况，房东也无法确定。
The landlord said that the two-day village "policy" change, the only certainty is that the return of non-residents, other circumstances, landlords can not determine.
其实，如果出具健康证明就让回家，我就回京了，但是现在的情况是，要去指定医院做检查，开健康证明，到指定地点隔离。
In fact, if the health certificate to go home, I returned to Beijing, but now the situation is to go to the designated hospital for an examination, a health certificate, to the designated location to isolate.
疫情当前可以理解，不理解也没办法，大家都没得选。
The epidemic is now understandable. There is no way to understand it, and no one has a choice.
买不到车票提前返京但被拦在小区门外陈菲24岁 游戏美术我老家是山东的，我在北京租的房子位于房山区稻田回迁楼南区。
Can not buy tickets to return to Beijing in advance but was blocked outside the residential area Chen Fei 24-year-old game art my hometown is Shandong, my rental house in Beijing is located in Fangshan rice fields back to the southern part of the building.
29号下午返京，我在火车上收到一条陌生短信，说是小区已封闭，除了本村村民，一律禁止进入小区。
Back in Beijing on the afternoon of the 29th, I received a strange text message on the train, said that the community has been closed, except for the villagers, all prohibited access to the community.
晚上9点半到北京西站下火车，10点多到小区，果然小区封了，保安不让我进，因为我是返京回来的租户。
9: 30 p.m. to the Beijing West Station to get off the train, 10: 00 to the community, as expected, the residential block, security not to let me in, because I am back to Beijing tenants.
我发现小区门口的牌子上，写的是要进行登记和在家隔离，并没说不让进。
I found a sign in front of the neighborhood that said "to register and segregate at home," not to say no.
但是大门保安坚决不让进，怎么说都不管用。
But the gate guards would not let it in, and it didn't work.
大晚上的，我进去拿点换洗衣服都不行。
In the evening, I can't go in and get some laundry.
当时我感到很无助，跟保安争论了一番，我打电话报警了，但是警察说他们管不了，让我拨打政府热线12345。
I felt helpless and had an argument with the security guard, and I called the police, who said they couldn't, and asked me to call the government hotline 12345.
我打了12345，并让警察出警到现场，警察说互相谅解，有损失可以起诉。
I called 12345 and told the police to come to the scene. The police said there was mutual understanding and that there were damages to be prosecuted.
12345第二天给物业打了电话，说让我找业主，但业主说也没有办法，因为小区房子是当地6个村的回迁房，这是6个村的事情，所以将小区封锁是当地村委会的决定。
12345 The following day, a call was made to the property saying that I should call the owner, but the owner said there was nothing to do, as the house was the home of six villages in the area, which was a matter for six villages, so it was the decision of the local village council to block it.
在警察来之前，保安跟我说有一男一女偷偷跑进去了，但是被他看到了。
Before the police arrived, the security guard told me that a man and a woman had sneaked in, but he saw it.
警察来了之后，保安带着警察，去楼里又把人给赶出来了，当时那俩人还拉着行李箱。
When the police arrived, the security guard took the police and drove them out of the building again, while the two men were carrying suitcases.
我是因为买不到返程的卧铺票，才选择提前返京，但没想到遇到这种情况。
I can not buy the return of sleeper tickets, just choose to return to Beijing early, but I did not expect to encounter this situation.
还好在第二天下午，物业跟我打电话说，除了湖北籍的，如果体温37度以下，可以联系房东签字进小区，但必须在家隔离14天，每天两次报告体温给物业。
Fortunately, the property called me the next afternoon, except Hubei nationality, if the temperature below 37 degrees, can contact the landlord to sign into the community, but must be isolated at home for 14 days, twice a day to report temperature to the property.
费了这么大周折，总算是进小区了。
After all this trouble, I finally got into the community.
北京好多小区都实施了封闭措施但每个小区的松严程度不同旖旎 27岁 互联网从业者我住北京图景嘉园小区，是公司提供的公租房。
Many neighborhoods in Beijing have imposed closures, but each has a very different degree of laxity. Looking at the 27-year-old Internet worker, I live in the Beijing Landscape Gardener, a public rental housing company.
初四，小区物业给我打电话，说外地返京人员要在定点医院开一个无发热证明，才能进小区。
Junior 4, residential property to me to call, said that people returning to Beijing in the designated hospital to open a non-febrile certificate, can enter the community.
定点医院离小区比较近的，有上地医院、西苑医院等，具体怎么定义，我本来打算昨天早上问的，结果得到了不让进小区的消息。
Destination of the hospital is relatively close to the community, there are hospitals on the ground, Xia Yuan Hospital, and so on, the specific definition, I had intended to ask yesterday morning, the results of the denial of access to the community.
昨天，我给物业打电话问具体政策，他们表示，目前小区全封闭，外来返京人员一律不许进门。
Yesterday, I called the property to ask for specific policies, they said that the current residential area is completely closed, the people are not allowed to enter the door.
物业的说法是，我们的公租房是村集体土地，属于村民自治。
Property is said that our public rental housing is village collective land, belonging to villagers' self-government.
村民一致同意，不让外地返京人员进门，那就可以不让外地返京人员进门。
Villagers agreed to keep people out of Beijing out of the city, so they wouldn't let them in.
我另一个同事也给物业打电话，得到的说法是小区遵照西北旺镇政府的通知，所以不让进门。
Another of my colleagues also called the property and was told that the neighborhood was not allowed to enter, following a notice from the government of the northwestern town of Wang.
最终他们也没有给一个明确的说法，不知道到底是因为什么不让进门，也不知道是谁做出的决策。
In the end, they did not give a clear statement, do not know exactly why not to enter the door, and do not know who made the decision.
之后我也给西北旺镇政府打了电话，工作人员回复说，他们只是建议指导小区注意防控，具体措施是物业执行。
Then I called the government in the northwestern town of Wangwang, and the staff replied that they were simply advising the neighborhood to take care of prevention and control, specifically, property enforcement.
目前政府已经接到多个反映图景嘉园小区问题的电话，具体如何解决，工作人员只是回应，他们会记录下来，向领导反映，并与小区协调。
At present, the Government has received a number of telephone calls reflecting the problems in the Landscape Garden area. The staff have only responded by recording them, making comments to the leadership and coordinating with the district.
至于结果如何，怎么给大家反馈，工作人员也没直接说明白。
As for the results, how to give feedback to you, the staff did not directly say.
这个房因为是通过公司的公租房，我也和公司反映了。
This house is through the company's public rental housing, I also and the company to reflect.
但是公司说，这是属地化管理，公司也没办法，让我暂时别回京。
But the company said it was part of local management and the company had no way to keep me away from Beijing for a while.
我现在人在山西，票已经退了。
I'm in Shanxi now and the tickets have been refunded.
我觉得封村、居家隔离都可以理解，但是小区不让进门，就没法理解了。
I think the isolation of villages and homes can be understood, but the community is not allowed to enter the door, there is no way to understand.
听说正月初五晚上九点多，有妈妈带着孩子回去也不让进去，报了警，最终也没有解决问题。
I heard that the first month on Friday night more than 9: 00, there is a mother with the children to go back also not to go in, reported to the police, and ultimately did not solve the problem.
北京有很多小区都在同一时间，开始实施封闭小区策略，但每个小区的松严程度也是不一样的。
Beijing has many small areas at the same time, began to implement the closed plot strategy, but the severity of each area is not the same.
我们紧邻着的小区，只是规定了返京人员要自我隔离两周，起码还能回自己的家。
Our neighborhood, except for a two-week self-imposed isolation, at least to return to their homes.
领导对我说“不是矫情的时候，疫情再大也要照常上班”但归京进不了家门李瑾 26岁广告策划这是我20几年经历过最魔幻的一个春节，等疫情结束，我要写一部小说把今年发生的事情记录下来。
The leader said to me: "When not affectionate, even if the epidemic situation is too big to work," but returned to Beijing can not enter the house Li Jin 26-year-old advertising planning This is I experienced more than 20 years experienced the most magical Spring Festival, when the end of the epidemic, I will write a novel to record this year's events.
我原本买了初四的票，晚上十一点半到北京的高铁。
I originally bought the tickets for the fourth day of junior high school.
买票的时候，就知道疫情比较严重了，但公司群里一直没动静，身边有朋友已经通知了延迟上班。
When I bought the ticket, I knew that the epidemic was serious, but the company has been quiet, around a friend has informed the delay to work.
我一直不敢退票，因为比较了解公司的风格。
I've been afraid to refund tickets because I know the company's style better.
初三早上我问领导，领导只是说去争取延迟。
On the morning of the third day of junior high school, I asked the leader.
一直等到初三晚上，我果断把票退了，心想大不了就辞职。
Until the evening of the third day of junior high school, I decisively returned the ticket, think big quit.
初四中午公司通知，说初七要正常上班，在家办公，且初七早上要把工作规划发过去。
At noon on the fourth day of the company notice that the seventh day to work normally, and work from home, and the work plan to send the past morning.
领导在群里一一提醒了每个人。
The leader reminded everyone in the group.
初六白天，北京开始传出封闭小区的消息，与此同时，领导开始追着大家回北京，并且要求下周一每个人都必须到岗。
During the day, word of the closure began to circulate in Beijing, while leaders began chasing everyone back to Beijing and demanding everyone be on duty next Monday.
我也担心疫情，但是领导在群里一直催，他告诉我们越早赶回北京越安全，还和我们说不是矫情和享受的时候。
I was also worried about the outbreak, but the leader kept urging us on, telling us that the sooner we got back to Beijing, the safer it would be, and he told us it was not a time for affectation or enjoyment.
我问了所有我能想到的汽运和拼车，拼车群里20多个去北京的师傅最近都不去了，没办法，我买了初七回去的高铁票，正常点的没有了，买了一张早上7点多的。
I asked all I could think of for bus transportation and carpooling. More than 20 teachers from the carpool who went to Beijing recently did not go.
从我们县到高铁站，还有一个小时路程，拼车的人倒是去，一问280元一个人。
From our county to the high-speed railway station, there is an hour's journey, the carpool is to go, a 280 yuan a person.
就在我说服自己无论怎么样也要回去的时候，有邻居发了消息，说我们小区也封了。
Just as I was persuading myself to go back anyway, a neighbor sent word that our neighborhood was closed, too.
因为身在北方，且我们县的疫情不怎么严重，所以我其实对疫情没有那么大的焦虑，当得知我回到北京也回不了家的那一刻，我开始能渐渐理解“武汉人”的心情。
Because I was in the north and the situation in my county was not so serious, I wasn't so worried about the outbreak. When I learned that I could not go back to Beijing, I began to understand the feelings of "Wuhan people.
起初我还存着侥幸心理，心想进不了小区大不了晚上翻墙悄悄溜进去。
At first I was left with nothing to chance, thinking that I could not get into the neighborhood at night.
但邻居说，有人这么干了以后，被居委会喊来警察带走了。
But neighbors said that after someone did so, the neighborhood committee called the police to take them away.
我彻底放弃了挣扎，并意识到了问题的严重，从邻居发来的图片看到，小区规定，凡是返京人员，一律不准入内。
I gave up the struggle completely, and realized the seriousness of the problem, from the neighbors from the picture, the neighborhood regulations, all returned to Beijing, all people are not allowed to enter.
小区封锁了除大门以外的所有小门，且大门口有一排人站岗。
The neighborhood sealed off all but the main gate, and a line of people stood guard at the gate.
公司群里还在不停催着大家回去，我问了几个在北京的亲戚，他们的小区也被封闭了，外地人进不去。
The company is still urging people to go back, I asked several relatives in Beijing, their community was also closed, outsiders can not enter.
我再次退掉了回京的高铁票，春节前前后后光退票手续费就花了三百多。
I returned the high-speed train ticket back to Beijing, before and after the Spring Festival on the cost of refund more than 300.
现在还不知道什么时候能回去。
I don't know when I'll be back.
河南老家封路北京房东不让返京刘凯 29岁 某互联网知识产权公司员工我现在在老家河南洛阳，我是1月21日回家的，当时开始关注到肺炎疫情，但刚开始感觉疫情是可控的。
I am now in my hometown of Luoyang, Henan Province. I came home on January 21st and started to pay attention to the pneumonia epidemic, but at the beginning I felt the epidemic was manageable.
本来准备春节回家串串亲戚就回北京，结果在家躺到了现在。
I was going to visit my relatives in Beijing for the Spring Festival, so I lie at home now.
老家这边年前并没有什么动静，初二才开始各种宣传，还封掉了出去的路，目前只留了一条生命线，供急救车通行。
Home this side of the year did not move, the beginning of the second day of publicity, but also closed out the road, there is only a lifeline for emergency vehicles to pass.
我住在北京市昌平区北七家镇，本来是打算昨天（初六）返京的，但上午突然收到房东通知说不让回去了。
I live in Changping District, Beijing, seven towns, was originally intended to return to Beijing yesterday (sixth day), but the morning suddenly received notice from the landlord that not to return.
房东发布的通知 来源 / 受访者房东那边没有说什么时候可以回去，只是说不允许返京人员入住了。
The landlord issued a notice to the source / interviewee Landlord there did not say when can go back, only said do not allow the return personnel to live in Beijing.
老家这边也是，本来找朋友帮我联系了个私家车，昨天晚上也临时告知不让上路了。
Home side is also, originally found a friend to help me to contact a private car, last night was also temporarily advised not to go on the road.
我联系了一个在汽车站的亲戚，他说目前河南疫情严重，具体什么时候开通还得等待上级指示。
I contacted a relative at the bus stop, who said the outbreak is serious in Henan province.
河南有个别地区疫情确实非常严重，但其实我们这一例都没有。
It is true that there are some very serious outbreaks in Henan Province, but we have none in this case.
我现在是既出不了河南，又回不去北京上班了。
I can't get out of Henan and go back to work in Beijing.
公司那边建议我们早点回京，然后自我隔离，如果没问题，就可以回去上班了。
The company advised us to go back to Beijing early and isolate ourselves. If there is no problem, we can go back to work.
但我现在也不知道什么时候能回去，家里人也和我说安全第一，再等等吧。
But I do not know when I can go back, the family and I said safety first, and so on.
我希望可以的话，公司最好可以安排远程办公。
I'd prefer the company to arrange telecommuting if I could.
公司要求上班，房东不让回去只能退了票再协调文文 24岁 北京某公司员工我家在河北省，在北京上班。
My home is in Hebei Province, and I am working in Beijing. My family is in Hebei Province, and I work in Beijing.
老家这边村里已经封了，可以出但是不能进。
The village on this side of our hometown is sealed off, but we can't go in.
公司规定初十上班，我按照之前买好的票打算昨天（初六）回北京，但是早上突然接到房东通知，说回去以后不能直接住，要先去北京别的地方隔离观察14天。
I plan to go back to Beijing yesterday (June 6), but in the morning I was told by the landlord that I could not live there directly. I had to go to another place in Beijing for 14 days.
我住在北京北五环外的白庙村，属于村里的小区，也对外出租。
I live in the village of Baimiao outside Beijing's North Fifth Ring Road, which belongs to the village and also rents it out.
这几天我们房东一天一个说法，前两天跟我们说可以回去，但是要待在家里不能出门，昨天又说不能去，然后又说要去医院开一个肺部检查，确定没有问题，拿着医院检查才能回村。
These days our landlord said one day, two days ago we can go back, but to stay at home can not go out, and yesterday said can not go, and then said to go to the hospital to open a lung examination, sure there is no problem, take a hospital examination before returning to the village.
现在因为回了北京没地方待，只能先退票了。
Now that I have no place to stay in Beijing, I have to refund my ticket first.
我跟公司汇报上去了，看看公司和房东这边各自有什么解决办法。
I'll report back to the company and see what the company and the landlord can do about it.
我这边得再跟房东沟通一下，他们也是根据村政府的通知来做的，可能根据疫情的变化来定，下一步看他们怎么解决。
I'll have to talk to the landlord again. They did it at the behest of the village government. It may depend on how the epidemic changes and what they do next.
再就是看看公司能不能协调一下住的地方，不然我这没法回去。
And see if the company can coordinate where we live, or I can't go back here.
其实前几天我还是觉得这种行为挺过分的，但这两天觉得可以理解。
In fact, a few days ago I still think this kind of behavior is quite excessive, but these two days feel understandable.
新闻上好多说有人返程上班，大巴上一个人感染了肺炎，传染半个车的人，确实还是待在家更安全一点。
On the news so many people back to work, a man on a bus infected with pneumonia, infect half a car, or really stay at home a little safer.
另外，回了北京以后其实生活也会挺不方便的，因为我住的那一片是村里，离地铁口还有点距离，如果公交等方式都不方便出行的话，日常来往交通可能也有点困难。
In addition, life will be very inconvenient after returning to Beijing, because I live in the village, a little distance from the subway entrance, if the public transportation and other means are not convenient to travel, daily traffic may also be a bit difficult.
饭店肯定也都没开，还要自己做饭。
The restaurant must have been open, and it had to cook its own meals.
而且现在疫情也是一天比一天严重，我也比较担心。
And now the epidemic is getting worse every day, and I am more worried.
父母倒是没有强制，但是建议我待在家里。
My parents were not forced, but I was advised to stay at home.
下一步我只能是等着公司和房东的通知了，我自己是想早一点回去上班。
The next step is to wait for the company and the landlord to notify me. I want to go back to work earlier myself.
小区不接受外地返京人员就怕抢不到回京的票张明 27岁 市场营销我本来准备1月30号回北京，却接到了中介打来的电话，说他也是上午刚接到政府的红头文件，从1月30号上午8点开始，所有外地返京人员不得进宏福苑小区。
I was planning to return to Beijing on January 30th, but I received a phone call from an intermediary saying that he had just received the government's red-letter document in the morning. From 8: 00 a.m. on January 30, all non-resident returnees would not be allowed to enter the Hongfu Yuan area.
宏福苑是挺大的一个小区，在昌平区，可能因为这两天属于返程高峰，想控制一下人数，小区就被封了。
Hong Fu Yuan is quite a large community, in Changping District, probably because these two days belong to the return peak, to control the number of people, the small area was closed.
具体哪天解封还没说，我只能把票退了。
The exact date of release has not been said, I have to return the ticket.
中介本来也是准备30号回北京的，现在他自己也不能回去。
The intermediary was also preparing to return to Beijing on the 30th, and now he himself can not go back.
我老家是黑龙江哈尔滨的，因为现在黑龙江已经有一例死亡人数，大家都有点慌张。
My hometown is Harbin of Heilongjiang, because now there is a death toll in Heilongjiang, we are a bit flustered.
有的小区甚至不让人出去，封路的封路，收费站挨个量体温，村里子拉满条幅，连经过的车辆都要登记，所有的饭店、大型超市、商场、洗浴中心和娱乐场所全部关门。
Some neighborhoods don't even allow people to go out, seal off roads, collect tolls to measure body temperature, fill the villages with banners, even passing cars, and close all restaurants, large supermarkets, shopping malls, bathing centres and entertainment establishments.
父母也很担心，不让我回北京。
My parents were worried too. They wouldn't let me go back to Beijing.
这次火车票退了的话，再买也挺麻烦。
If the train ticket is returned, it will be troublesome to buy it again.
等到国家统一规定了复工时间，大家都会一窝蜂的抢，还不能提前预定。
When the national reunification of the resumption of work time, everyone will be scrambling, can not be booked in advance.
哈尔滨到北京的票，本来就特别难抢，那天看新闻应该是属于难买城市的TOP10。
Harbin to Beijing tickets, originally very difficult to grab, that day to see the news should be a difficult to buy the city of Top10.
虽说现在有电脑在哪都可以办公，关键是，现在连我的客户也都没有上班，我们也就没法开工。
While computers are now available everywhere, the key is that even my clients are not at work now, so we can't start.
大家都要推迟开工，都拖着，我们急也没有用，但心里也为今年整个的行情发愁，在家呆着反而更焦虑。
We all have to delay the start of the work, we are in no hurry, but the heart of the whole market this year worried, stay at home instead more anxious.
就算回北京了也是问题，我打开外卖一看，现在接单的店变少了，外送费最起码8元起，贵的要二三十块，而且现在有的小区根本不让外卖小哥进门，回去吃饭都成难题。
Even back to Beijing is a problem, I opened take-out, now orders of the shop is fewer, the cost of delivery at least 8 yuan, the expensive to 20 and 30 dollars, and now some of the small community do not allow take-out brother to enter the door, back to eat is a difficult problem.
我平时本来就不做饭，外卖没了很难想象自己要怎么活，最近还是在家先跟爸妈学做饭吧。
I usually do not cook, takeaway is difficult to imagine their own way of life, recently at home with my parents to learn to cook bar.
父母阻止我回北京说大不了就辞职在家考事业单位陈志 25岁 互联网公司运营我在北京一家互联网公司上班，在放假前好不容易抢到了初六返京的火车票，打算初七准时上班，但没想到疫情这么严重，假期延长了三天，初五那天我正要改签，我妈却让我直接退票，不想让我回北京。
My parents prevented me from returning to Beijing and said I would quit my job at home. Chen Zhi, a 25-year-old Internet company, worked for an Internet company in Beijing. I managed to get the train ticket back to Beijing before the holiday.
我父母本来是对这个病没什么概念的，但我回来之后反复和他们讲这个病的情况，慢慢他们自己也害怕了，朋友叫吃饭都拒绝了，也没有串门拜年。
My parents had no idea about the disease, but I came back and told them about it again and again. They grew afraid of it themselves.
他们在家没事干，每天开着央视13台新闻频道，不断听着疫情新闻，念叨哪里又增加了多少病例，还对微信群里的各种谣言深信不疑，越来越觉得疫情严重。
They have nothing to do at home, driving CCTV's 13 news channels every day, listening to news of the epidemic, reading about how many cases have been added, and believing in rumors in the micro-mail community that the epidemic is getting worse.
这几天，我们县城封闭了进出道路，除货运车外一切车辆禁止出入，小道消息不断传来，我妈听说过了正月十五才会安全一些，坚决让我退票。
In the past few days, our county closed access roads, except for the freight car all vehicles are prohibited from entering and leaving, rumors continue to come, my mother heard that the first 15 months will be safer, firmly let me refund tickets.
初五那天晚上吃饭的时候，他们两人一唱一和，说这场疫情不知道要持续到什么时候，劝我留在家里，以前他们总给我转发市里一些机关单位的招聘启事，让我考公务员或者参加事业单位招录，但都被我拒绝了，这次他们要我向公司请假到正月十五，如果公司不批准就让我辞职，等疫情过去再考虑工作的事情。
On the evening of the fifth day of junior high school, they sang with each other that I was not sure when the epidemic was going to last. They used to send me job notices from some city offices, asking me to take an examination for civil servants or public institutions.
除了疫情本身，他们还列了其他理由，说我不会做饭，回北京后点外卖、食堂吃都不安全，我说可以囤一些干粮，他们坚决反对；另外，他们听说返京人员要去医院检查开健康证明，怕我感染，觉得现在回去不确定性太多，让我老老实实待在家里。
Besides the outbreak itself, they cited other reasons why I couldn't cook, that it was unsafe for me to order takeaway food and eat in the cafeteria after returning to Beijing. I said they could hoard some dry food, they said.
我现在还在等公司通知，很多互联网公司都推迟了复工时间或者在家办公，网上说北京有些小区不让外地返京人员进入，我还得观望小区会不会通知我别回去，另外还有口罩、食品等物资，我都没有储备，也不容易买到，这些都构成了一些风险，我是独生家庭，不想父母太担心，确实有些为难，只希望疫情能快点过去，不要给人们的生活造成太大的影响。
I am still waiting for the company to inform me that many Internet companies have postponed working hours or working from home. The Internet says that some communities in Beijing are closed to foreign visitors. I have to see if the community will not tell me not to go back.
