回溯新型冠状病毒在武汉的蔓延过程，“超级传播者”的出现，几乎是一种必然1月21日，国家卫健委高级别专家组成员、香港大学微生物学系讲座教授袁国勇提出“超级传播者可能已经出现”，称当时公布的武汉15名被感染医护人员当中，14人是被同一病人传染的。
Yuan Guoyong, professor of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the high-level group of experts of the National Health Council, raised the issue of "super-disseminators may have appeared," saying that 14 of the 15 infected medical personnel in Wuhan were infected by the same patient.
随后，武汉市长周先旺在媒体上的发言直接将“超级传播者”锁定在了华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院神经外科。
Later, Wuhan City Chang Zhou Sang-wang in the media speech will be "super communicator" locked in the Tongji School of Medicine affiliated with the Hospital Neurosurgery.
1月21日，他在接受央视记者采访时说：“在华中科技大学附属协和医院出现的交叉感染是出现在脑神经外科的一个病人，而不是在传染科。
"The cross-infection at the Concorde Hospital, an affiliate of the Central University of Science and Technology, is a patient in neurosurgery, not in the department of infection," he told CCTV on January 21.
因为脑神经外科忽视了这位病人入院之前有这种新型冠状病毒的感染。
Brain neurosurgery ignored the patient's infection with the new coronavirus before admission.
所以做完手术以后，病人出现发烧，这个时候，一个医生、13个护士被感染了。
So after the operation, the patient developed a fever, at which time a doctor, 13 nurses were infected.
”“绝不存在‘忽视’一说！”武汉协和的一位神经外科医生对此发文写道：患者术前没有任何呼吸道症状，术后三天出现肺部感染，术后第五天考虑“疑似不明原因肺炎”，积极上报，并在院感办专员和感染科、呼吸科专家指导下进行隔离、消毒和治疗。
"There is no such thing as' neglect '!" A neurosurgeon from Wuhan Concorde wrote: The patient did not have any respiratory symptoms before the operation, developed lung infection three days after surgery, considered "suspected pneumonia" on the fifth day after surgery, and reported it actively and isolated, disinfected and treated under the guidance of the hospital sentinel and infection and respiratory specialists.
并声明，确诊感染的14人其实是10名神经外科护士，和小儿外科、妇科、心外和心内科的4名医务人员。
The 14 people diagnosed with the infection were in fact 10 neurosurgical nurses and 4 medical personnel in pediatric surgery, gynaecology, cardiology and cardiology, it said.
1月21日16时，在广东省政府新闻办举办的新闻发布会上，钟南山透露，“在武汉就出现了一个病人影响了14个医护人员的案例，这个并没有出现在传染病医院，而是出现在不是收传染病人的地方——神经（外）科。
"At 16: 00 on January 21, Zhong Nan-shan revealed at a press conference organised by the Guangdong Provincial Government Information Office." There was a case in Wuhan where 14 medical personnel were affected by a patient.
所以我们要关注所有的医护人员（的防疫问题）。
So we have to pay attention to all the health care workers.
”北京大学的一位专家在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时指出，这位感染多位医务人员的患者可以被认定为超级传播者。
In an interview with China News Weekly, an expert at Peking University said the patient, who was infected with several medical staff, could be identified as a "super-communicator."
该专家说，在感染人数判断上，如果感染人数超过三个，就可以考虑在超级传播者的范围内；如果感染人数超过十个，就应该是比较确切的超级传播者。
In terms of the number of people infected, the expert said, if the number of infections exceeds three, it could be considered to be in the super-transmission range; if the number of infections exceeds 10, it should be a more accurate super-communicator.
“超级传播者”一个月前，患有脑垂体瘤的赵军实终于住进武汉协和神经外科，69岁的他心脏功能不太好，有冠心病、窦性心动过缓等毛病，为此住了12天院，进行术前检查和评估。
A month ago, Zhao Junsheng, who had a pituitary tumor, was admitted to Wuhan Concorde Neurosurgery. At the age of 69, he suffered from heart failure, coronary heart disease and sinus bradycardia.
据该院神经外科的一名医护人员回忆，赵军实首诊应该是在住院前十几天，这位医护人员强调说，“患者没有华南海鲜市场接触史”。
"The patient had no history of exposure to the South China seafood market," the hospital's neurosurgeon recalled, noting that Zhao's initial visit should have taken place a few days before hospitalization.
手术前，赵军实没有任何呼吸道症状，体温正常，白细胞和淋巴细胞值正常。
Before the operation, Zhao Junshi did not have any respiratory symptoms, normal body temperature, white blood cells and lymphocytes normal value.
术前常规胸片显示，他的“左肋膈角区见条片影”，考虑到他年龄较大，又有吸烟史，肺部有炎症或肺纹理增粗是正常的。
A routine chest X-ray revealed that his "left ribbed diaphragm area was seen in a strip," which was normal given his age and smoking history, inflammation of the lungs or thickening of the lung.
据医护人员回忆，赵军实当时中气十足，精神状况很好，几乎没有任何理由怀疑他有“不明原因肺炎”感染可能。
Zhao, the hospital staff recall, was so angry and in good spirits that there was little reason to suspect he might have contracted pneumonia for unknown reasons.
不过，1月7日手术当晚，也有医生相互转告，“小心防护”。
But on January 7, the night of the surgery, doctors told each other, "Be careful."
一周前的2019年12月30日，医院收到了内部通知，武汉《市卫生健康委关于报送不明原因肺炎救治情况的紧急通知》要求：立即清查统计近一周接诊过的具有类似特点的不明原因肺炎患者。
A week ago, on December 30, 2019, the hospital received an internal notification that Wuhan's "Emergency Notice from the Municipal Health Commission on the Treatment of Unexplained Pneumonia" required that an immediate check-up be made of patients with unexplained pneumonia with similar characteristics who had been treated in the past week.
2020年1月5日，卫健委再次通报，符合不明原因的病毒性肺炎诊断患者59例，未发现明确的人传人证据，未发现医务人员感染。
On 5 January 2020, the Wei Jianghuang Commission again informed that 59 cases of patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia for unknown reasons had not been found with clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection by medical personnel had been found.
“在这种情况下，怎样未卜先知地去隔离病人、上三级防护？”上述医护人员说。
"In this case, how do you isolate the patient from the tertiary level of protection?" said the paramedics.
根据相关规定，医疗防护分为一级、二级、三级。
Medical protection is divided into levels I, II and III in accordance with the relevant regulations.
二级防护要求相关医务人员进入隔离留观室和专门病区必须戴12层以上棉纱口罩，穿工作服、隔离衣、鞋套，戴手套、工作帽，每次接触病人后立即进行手清洗和消毒。
Secondary protection requires the relevant medical personnel to wear a cotton mask of 12 storeys or more, work clothes, protective clothing, shoes, gloves, working cap and hand washing and disinfection immediately after each contact with the patient.
三级防护，适用于为病人实施吸痰、气管切开和气管插管的医务人员，在二级防护基础上，还应当加戴全面型呼吸防护器。
Level-III protection for medical personnel who perform sputum, tracheotomy and trachea intubation for the patient, in addition to secondary protection, full-scale respiratory protection should be added.
但对于当时武汉协和神经外科的医护人员们来说，很难说服一个还没有任何呼吸症状的患者做隔离，而且三级防护装备属于医疗耗材，还涉及费用和报销等问题。
But for Wuhan Concorde neurosurgery staff at the time, it was difficult to convince a patient who did not have any respiratory symptoms to be isolated, and level III protective equipment was a medical consumable with costs and reimbursement implications.
按医院常规操作，病人总共转了三次病房，手术前住在神经外科19层病房。
According to the hospital routine operation, the patient was transferred to the ward three times and stayed in the neurosurgery ward on the 19th floor.
手术完成的很顺利，1月8日凌晨，术后转至神外二号楼3楼的监护室，病情稳定后又被转到神外18层普通病房。
The operation was completed smoothly. In the early morning of 8 January, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit on the third floor of the Shenwen-2 building.
在此期间，1月9日，中国卫生专家组通报，武汉不明原因病毒性肺炎的病原体初步判定为新型冠状病毒。
Meanwhile, on January 9, the China Health Expert Group reported that the pathogen of the unidentified viral pneumonia in Wuhan had been tentatively identified as a new coronavirus.
1月11日，赵军实突然出现发热症状，但这在临床上极难判别原因，造成非感染性的术后发热的因素包括机体应激改变、脑血管刺激、颅内压力变化、病灶吸收热等等。
On January 11, Zhao Junxian suddenly developed febrile symptoms, but it is very difficult to identify the causes of non-infectious postoperative fever, including changes in body stress, cerebrovascular stimulation, intracranial pressure changes, lesion heat absorption and so on.
神经外科医生立即开具了肺部CT检查，影像显示：双肺多发片状模糊影伴右侧胸水，磨玻璃改变考虑间质性肺炎。
The neurosurgeon immediately performed a pulmonary CT scan, which revealed multiple-slice blurring of the lungs with right pleural effusion, and molded glass to account for interstitial pneumonia.
已经出现明显的肺部感染表现。
There have been clear signs of pulmonary infection.
与此同时，赵军实的白细胞明显升高，以中性粒细胞升高为主，淋巴细胞正常偏低，这些并非病毒感染的典型改变。
At the same time, the leucocytes of Zhao Junsheng were obviously elevated, the neutrophils were elevated and lymphocytes were normally low.
主治医生马上按相关规定上报院感科，请各专科会诊，对患者的痰液、咽拭子标本进行了采样病检，由于此时新型冠状病毒试剂盒还没有到位，患者一系列病毒检查如呼吸道合胞病毒RNA等均为阴性，只能考虑“疑似不明原因肺炎”。
The attending physician immediately reported the matter to the Department of Sensation in accordance with the relevant regulations. Specialty consultations were conducted to examine samples of the patient's sputum and pharyngeal swab samples. As the new coronavirus kit was not in place, a series of virus tests such as RNA were negative and only "suspected pneumonia" could be considered.
那么问题来了：患者是在什么时候被感染的？如果是住院前感染，则患者潜伏期已经超过15天，这与专家给出的新型冠状病毒潜伏期最长为12天不符。
The question then arises: When was the patient infected? In the case of a pre-hospital infection, the incubation period exceeded 15 days, which is not consistent with the experts' indication of a maximum incubation period of 12 days for the new coronavirus.
如果考虑是住院后感染，病人术后换过3次病房，“几个病房位置（相隔）很远，没办法厘清是在哪里感染的。
If postoperative infection is considered, the patient changes the ward three times after surgery. "Several wards are too far apart to be able to determine where the infection occurred.
”前述医护人员表示，在3楼监护室附近的两位患者后来也被确诊为新型冠状病毒肺炎。
The two patients in the vicinity of the third-floor intensive care unit were later diagnosed with the new coronavirus pneumonia, paramedics said.
但另一位受访医生则指出，“除了这位患者，后来被隔离的还有其他患者和医生。
But another doctor interviewed said: "In addition to the patient, other patients and doctors were later isolated.
”术后第五日，赵军实的肺炎症状呈现难以逆转的恶化态势，肺部CT为“双肺多发模糊影”，与他接触的多名医护人员也陆续出现发热症状。
"On the fifth day of surgery, Zhao's pneumonia showed signs of irreversible deterioration, with pulmonary CT" multiple blurring of the lungs, "and a number of doctors and nurses he came in contact with developed febrile symptoms.
在感染科、呼吸科的指导下，医院立即把病人转移进扩建的感染病房，进行隔离、消毒和治疗。
Under the guidance of the Department of Infection and Respiratory Department, the hospital immediately transferred the patient to the expanded infection ward for isolation, disinfection and treatment.
这时赵军实已经转移到了术后的第四个病房。
By this time Zhao Junsheng had moved to the fourth ward after the operation.
针对发热的医护人员，医院立即开辟了专门的隔离病房进行隔离安置。
For febrile medical personnel, the hospital immediately opened a special isolation room for isolation placement.
到1月15日，赵军实被确诊新型冠状病毒感染，按要求立即转诊至武汉金银潭医院。
On January 15, Zhao Jun was diagnosed with a new coronavirus infection and was immediately referred to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital as required.
前述医护人员说：“医生能做到的防护都已经做到最好了，并不是所谓的‘疏忽了’。
"Doctors have done their best to protect themselves, not so-called 'negligent'," said the aforementioned paramedics.
”在武汉市卫健委16日23:55分发布的通告中，仍未提及医护人员感染情况。
The notice issued by Wuhan Health Commission at 23: 55 on the 16th did not mention the infection among medical staff.
被压制的信息回溯新型冠状病毒在武汉的蔓延过程，赵军实这样的“超级传播者”的出现，几乎是一种必然。
Suppressed information traces the spread of the new-style coronavirus in Wuhan, Zhao Junshi such as the emergence of "super communicators," is almost a certainty.
2019年12月30日，网上流传出一份盖有武汉市卫生健康委员会医政医管处公章的红头文件，紧急通知“武汉市华南海鲜市场陆续出现不明原因肺炎”。
On December 30, 2019, a red document bearing the official seal of the Medical and Medical Administration Office of Wuhan Municipal Health Commission was circulated on the Internet, urgently notifying "the unexplained pneumonia in the south China seafood market in Wuhan."
武汉协和医院的医生林羽回忆说，疫情刚开始的时候，武汉市的策略都是“冷处理”。
Lin Yu, a doctor at Wuhan Concorde Hospital, recalled that when the outbreak first started, Wuhan's strategy was "cold handling."
他所在的医院就通知，在没有单位授权的时候，不允许私自在公众平台谈论病情，不允许私自接受媒体采访，不仅仅是临床系统，包括院感、CDC那边消息管控更严重，“整个就不让说”。
His hospital has informed him that it is not allowed to talk about the disease on a public platform or to give private interviews to the media without the permission of the organization, not only the clinical system, including hospital feeling, but also the CDC side of the message control more serious, "the whole no talk.
当时，医生们唯一能做的就是一再嘱咐就诊患者：“口罩、口罩、一定要买口罩、戴口罩”，甚至半开玩笑地嘱咐“不要去华南海鲜市场买东西，那里东西不新鲜。
At the time, the only thing doctors could do was repeatedly order patients: "masks, masks, masks," or even half-jokingly, "Do not go to the South China seafood market, where things are not fresh.
”12月31日，武汉市政府公告称，共发现27例病例，其中7例严重，未发现明显人传人现象，未发现医务人员感染。
On December 31, the Wuhan municipal government announced that 27 cases had been found, seven of them serious, with no apparent human-to-human transmission and no cases of infection by medical personnel.
人民日报官方微博发消息：“目前病因尚未明确，不能断定是网上传言的SARS病毒。
"The cause is not clear and it cannot be concluded that it was the SARS virus rumored on the Internet," the official Weibo People's Daily said.
”武汉市公安机关经调查核实，还传唤了8名在网络上发布、转发不实信息的违法人员，依法进行了处理，并在2020年第一天通过官方微博发布了这条消息。
After an investigation, the Wuhan public security organs also summoned eight people who broke the law by publishing and forwarding false information on the Internet, handled the case according to law and posted the news on an official Weibo on the first day of 2020.
从1月6日至1月10日，武汉市卫健委没再就“不明原因肺炎”发布通报。
From January 6 to January 10, Wuhan city health committee on the "unknown causes of pneumonia" no longer issued a notice.
“12.31通报疫情，当天我去买口罩，药店排长队，而且断货。
"12.31 To inform of the outbreak, I went to buy a mask that day, long queues at pharmacies and stock-outs.
后面几天官方要我们“不传谣”，而且说“未见人传人”，我们松懈了。
After a few days of official "no rumors", and said "no one to the other", we relaxed.
再后面一周多，病例一个没有增加，我们以为事情就这样结束了。
More than a week later, the number of cases did not increase, and we thought it was over.
”一位武汉网友在在个人社交平台上写道。
A Wuhan netizen wrote on his personal social networking platform.
1月11日更新的通报中，武汉市卫健委继续表示：“自2020年1月3日以来未发现新发病例。
"There have been no new cases since January 3, 2020," Wuhan city health committee Wei said in an update on January 11.
目前，未发现医务人员感染，未发现明确的人传人证据。
At present, no infection by medical personnel has been detected and no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.
”而就在此后几天，泰国、日本纷纷报出确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎病例。
In the days that followed, Thailand and Japan reported a new case of coronavirus pneumonia.
1月12日～17日，湖北省十三届人大三次会议正在武汉市召开。
From January 12 to 17, the Third Session of the Thirteenth National People's Congress of Hubei Province is being held in Wuhan.
18日，百步亭社区还举行了第20届“万家宴”。
On the 18th, the Bumpting community also held the 20th session of the "Banquet."
20日下午，湖北省应急管理厅举办了春节联欢会。
On the afternoon of the 20th, the Emergency Management Bureau of Hubei Province held the Spring Festival Gala.
21日，省春节团拜会文艺演出在洪山礼堂举办。
21, the provincial Spring Festival group visit cultural performances in the Hongshan auditorium.
参加演出的湖北省民族歌舞团官方账号写道，到场观看的有省领导和省各界代表，“在武汉：大家带着层层口罩，克服肺炎恐慌，用敬业、执着、认真全力以赴。
The official Hubei Provincial Song and Dance Ensemble Account, which participated in the performance, wrote that provincial leaders and provincial representatives from all walks of life attended the performance.
”在1月20日前，武汉大街上戴口罩的人并不多。
Before January 20, not many people were wearing masks on the streets of Wuhan.
林羽曾询问武汉地铁职工为什么不带口罩，对方说是领导不让带，怕引起恐慌。
Lin Yu once asked Wuhan Metro staff why do not wear masks, the other side said the leadership do not take, afraid to cause panic.
“太寒心了！如果官方刚开始就把情况说清楚的话，百分之五六十的人会做好防护吧。
'Too cold! If the authorities had made it clear at the outset, fifty or sixty per cent would have taken precautions.
”林羽对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Lin told China News Weekly.
“意识到事情严重了，就是在钟南山院士（20日）出来说话（“人传人”）之后。
"The realization of the seriousness of the matter, is in Zhong Nan Shan academician (20) out to speak (" person-to-person ") after.
”多位受访者这样表示。
A number of respondents said so.
此时的武汉协和医院已将体检中心临时征用为“感染病房”，一楼为输液室，2～3层为病人病房，4层设置了医护人员隔离室，疑似感染的医护人员19日已经被安置其中，最高峰时有二十多位医护人员疑似感染。
At this time, Wuhan Concorde Hospital has temporarily requisitioned the medical examination center as "infection ward," the first floor for the infusion room, 2-3 floors for the patients' wards, 4-storey isolation rooms for medical staff, suspected infection of the medical staff has been 19-day placement, the peak of more than 20 medical staff suspected of infection.
1月20日钟南山讲话之后，混乱仍在持续。
The chaos continued after Zhong Nan-shan spoke on January 20th.
22日，疑似感染了新型冠状病毒的待产妇刘芳在武汉协和感染科住到第四天，即将临盆。
On February 22, Liu Fang, a woman suspected of contracting the new coronavirus, stayed in Wuhan Concoronavirus department until the fourth day, about to give birth.
因为怕对胎儿有影响，她一直没做CT，能够检测新型冠状病毒的试剂盒因紧缺也一直没排到她。
Fearing the fetus, she did not do CT, can detect the new coronavirus kit because of the shortage has not been scheduled to her.
“剖的当天确诊了，因为第一胎剖腹，这胎还得剖，没有办法，医生就穿着三级防护服，穿得像宇航员一样给她做了剖腹产。
"The profile was confirmed on the same day because the first child was cut, and the foetus had to be cut in order to be able to perform a caesarean section in a third-degree suit, dressed like an astronaut.
”林羽对《中国新闻周刊》说。
Lin told China News Weekly.
23日发布的《武汉市卫生健康委关于市民关心的几个问题的答复》中提到，前期（1月22日前）全市“每天可检测样本200多份”，但光是武汉协和的发热门诊每天就有近200人在排队，这还只是武汉市七个定点诊疗医院之一。
Before January 22, more than 200 samples could be tested every day, but Wuhan Concorde's fever clinic alone had nearly 200 people queuing up every day, just one of seven designated hospitals in Wuhan.
当时，武汉协和排队最长的超过了5小时、短则2～3个小时，“病人往上报，几天都没有反应，然后上面说还在等，人太多，导致很多医生、病人不能确诊。
At that time, Wuhan Concorde line up for the longest time more than five hours, short of two to three hours, "the patient reported to the report, a few days did not respond, and then said it is still waiting, too many people, resulting in many doctors, patients can not diagnose.
”林羽说，当时，院内还有接近三十名医护人员在隔离观察。
Lin said close to 30 hospital staff were still being quarantined.
除了发热门诊的医护人员配备了护目镜、口罩、隔离衣等三级防护装备，其他科室和病房的医生和护士除了口罩，基本没有其他防护。
Except for the provision of protective equipment such as goggles, face masks and protective clothing at the heating clinic, doctors and nurses in other sections and wards have little or no protection other than masks.
“请求支援！”前述神经外科医生整理出武汉市二十多家医院的名单，发在个人社交平台上，“资源紧张，多家医院物资可能只够维持3～5天。
The aforementioned neurosurgeon compiled a list of more than 20 hospitals in Wuhan and posted it on a personal social networking platform. "Resources are tight, and many hospitals may be able to maintain supplies only for three to five days.
