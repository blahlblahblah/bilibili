Source: Needplx Journalist: Sean According to a model developed by the British government and scientists around the world, the number of confirmed cases in the UK will increase rapidly over the next 10 to 14 weeks, peaking between the end of May and mid-June.
””提出备受争议的“群体免疫”思路仅四天之后，又倏然拉高全国防疫政策标准，英国首相约翰逊的抗疫政策有如过山车般大起大落。
Only four days after advancing the controversial idea of mass immunization, British Prime Minister Gordon Johnson's anti-epidemic policy was a roller coaster ride.
约翰逊在周一（3月16日）提出，家里但凡有一人出现发烧咳嗽等症状，全家人都应该自我隔离14天。
Johnson suggested on Monday that families should be isolated for up to 14 days if one person in the family has symptoms such as a fever and a cough.
此外他还呼吁避免人际间的不必要接触，停止非必要旅行，尽量不前往酒吧、夜店、剧院和餐厅等人群密集的地方，居家工作。
In addition, he called for the avoidance of unnecessary interpersonal contact, the cessation of non-essential travel and the minimization of working from home in crowded places such as bars, nightclubs, theatres and restaurants.
约翰逊还提出，70岁以上老人、孕妇以及患有基础疾病的易感人群应该在12周内避免前往公众场所。
Johnson also suggested that people over the age of 70, pregnant women and vulnerable people with basic illnesses should avoid going to public places within 12 weeks.
如非必要不要使用国民医疗体系（NHS）的服务，减少医疗系统压力。
If not necessary, do not use NHS services to reduce the pressure on the health system.
但这些都只是“建议”，不强制要求执行，餐厅和酒吧等也没有被强制关闭，但有一些剧院已经主动宣布暂时关门。
But these are "recommendations" that are not enforced, and restaurants and bars have not been forced to close, although some have voluntarily closed down.
反对党工党议员穆雷（Ian Murray）表示，政府不下达明确命令会让企业更难生存，尤其是没有充足现金流的那些。
Opposition Labour MP Ian Murray said the government's failure to give clear orders would make it harder for businesses to survive, especially those without sufficient cash flow.
尽管比较“温和”，但上述防控措施相比约翰逊在上周四（3月12日）提出的“佛系”路线已经是完全不同的方向。
Although "moderate," the measures are a far different direction from the "Buddhism" line that Johnson proposed on Thursday.
约翰逊此前表示，英国不会停课或禁止集会；出现轻微症状的患者也只是被要求居家隔离一周，无需接受病毒检测；唯一的建议的就是勤洗手并保持警惕。
Johnson had said Britain would not suspend classes or hold rallies; patients with mild symptoms were only asked to stay in quarantine for a week without being tested for the virus; the only advice was to wash their hands regularly and remain vigilant.
约翰逊的策略是，如果英国有三分之二的人感染新冠肺炎，并在康复后获得免疫，就能彻底切断病毒传播，英国人将全部安全，也就是所谓的“群体免疫”。
Johnson's strategy is that if two-thirds of the UK population is newly infected with pneumonia and is immunized after recovery, the virus will be completely cut off and the British will be completely safe, the so-called "mass immunization."
这个与多数欧洲国家截然相反的思路招致政界和医学界的严厉批评。
The idea, which is diametrically opposed to that of most European countries, has drawn harsh criticism from political and medical circles.
英国医学杂志《柳叶刀》主编荷顿（Richard Horton）发推特称，意大利正在发生的事情都是真实的，而英国政府并没有在为应对现实做准备。
Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, a British medical journal, tweeted that what was happening in Italy was true and that the British government was not preparing for reality.
英政府首席科学顾问瓦伦斯（Patrick Vallance）周一并没有推翻“群体免疫”的概念，但表示这会是传染病疫情带来的附加结果，而不应该是一个直接的策略。
Patrick Vallance, the government's chief science adviser, did not overturn the concept of "mass immunization" Monday, but said it would be a side effect of the epidemic and not a direct strategy.
英国的主要目标依然是延缓病毒传播，保护脆弱群体。
The UK's main goal remains to slow the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable groups.
约翰逊表示，因为英国确诊人数呈现迅速增长的态势，因此需要采取更有力的措施。
Johnson said stronger measures were needed because of the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in the UK.
英政府知情人士也对美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）透露，英国的确诊病例增加速度超过预期，且其中老年人比例很高，因此政府不得不迅速开启下一步计划。
The UK has seen a faster-than-expected increase in confirmed cases, with a high proportion of older people, forcing the government to move quickly on next steps, people familiar with the situation told CNN.
一名政府大臣称，从“佛系”抗疫到加强防控措施的转变实际上是计划好的，只是因为现实情况而加快了速度。
A government minister said the shift from "Buddhism" to stronger control measures was actually planned, only to be accelerated by reality.
截至当地时间15日，英国累计确诊病例1543例，死亡55例，15日单日新增171例。
Up to the 15th local time, the total number of confirmed cases in the United Kingdom of 1543 cases, 55 deaths, 15 days new 171 cases.
英国广播公司（BBC）报道称，预计英国目前实际感染人数在3.5至5万人。
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reports that the actual number of people currently infected is expected to be between 35,000 and 50,000.
目前英国仅有4.4万人已经接受了病毒检测。
Only 44,000 people in the UK have been tested for the virus.
英国首席医疗官惠蒂（Chris Whitty）表示，应对疫情的措施需要维持一段较长的时间，大家不应陷入“我只需要坚持几周就好”的幻想中。
Chris Whitty, Britain's chief medical officer, said the response to the outbreak would need to be sustained over a longer period of time, and that people should not fall into the illusion that "I just need to stick to it for a few weeks."
他透露，英国还准备扩大检测规模。
Britain is also preparing to scale up testing, he said.
除了检测，确诊患者收治对英国医疗系统来说也是巨大挑战。
In addition to testing, identifying patients for treatment is a big challenge for the British health system.
英国政府已经向劳斯莱斯、福特和本田等机械制造商提出援助请求，希望他们加入呼吸机等医疗用品的生产。
The British government has petitioned machinery makers such as Rolls-Royce, Ford and Honda to join in the manufacture of medical supplies such as ventilators.
一些英国酒店将被征用于收治患者，退休医生也被呼吁返岗。
Some British hotels will be called in to treat patients, and retired doctors are being called upon to return.
目前医院里一些非必要手术已经取消。
Some non-essential operations in hospitals have now been cancelled.
据英国《卫报 》报道，英国公共卫生部（PHE）在向NHS官员做简报时提出，英国的疫情将持续到来年春天，最终将有80%的英国人被感染，790万人需要住院。
In a briefing to NHS officials, the UK's Department of Public Health (PHE) said the outbreak would continue into the spring, with 80 per cent of Britons eventually infected and 7.9 million in hospital, The Guardian reported.
此外，PHE预计在500万在关键服务和基础设施领域的从业者中，会有十分之一被感染，包括医务人员。
In addition, PHE projects that one in 10 of the five million practitioners in critical services and infrastructure will be infected, including medical personnel.
一名NHS官员指出，80%的感染率意味着英国因新冠肺炎死亡的人数可能超过50万。
An NHS official said 80 percent of the infections mean the death toll from pneumonia could exceed half a million in Britain.
这份简报文件中还提到，因为实验室能力有限，英国卫生系统无法对所有出现症状的人进行检测，只能检测症状严重已经入院治疗，以及在养老院及监狱等易爆发集聚性感染的患者。
The briefing paper also mentioned that, because of limited laboratory capacity, the British health system was not able to screen all persons with symptoms, but only those who had severe symptoms and were hospitalized, as well as those who were at risk of developing a concentrated infection, such as in nursing homes and prisons.
即便是NHS的员工也不能保障能接受检测。
Even NHS workers are not guaranteed access to testing.
但首席医疗官惠蒂说，这是最糟糕的情况，真实感染人数可能会少得多。
But Chief Medical Officer Judy Whitty says this is the worst-case scenario and the true number of infections is likely to be much lower.
他指出，根据英国政府和全球科学家制作的模型，未来10至14周英国确诊病例将迅速增加，并于5月底至6月中旬达到顶峰。
He noted that, according to models developed by the British Government and scientists around the world, the number of confirmed cases in the United Kingdom would increase rapidly over the next 10 to 14 weeks, peaking at the end of May and the middle of June.
东英吉利大学（University of East Anglia）医学教授、传染病学专家亨特（Paul Hunter）解释称，疫情还将持续一年的消息的确会让民众感到沮丧和担忧，但他们实际上没能完全理解这个数据背后的逻辑。
Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia and a specialist in infectious diseases, explains that the news that the outbreak will continue for another year does frustrate and worry the public, but they don't really fully understand the logic behind the data.
亨特认为，疫情到夏天会慢慢消退，6月底结束，但11月又会卷土重来，就像季节性流感那样。
Hunt believes the outbreak will subside by the summer and end at the end of June, but will return in November, as with seasonal flu.
新冠肺炎将一直存在，但随着人群免疫力的提高，它的严重程度也会大大减弱。
Coronary pneumonia will always exist, but its severity will be greatly reduced as people's immunity improves.
不过，中国科学家钟南山近日表示，目前还没有证据证明新冠肺炎今后会季节性流行。
However, Chinese scientist Zhong Nan-shan said recently that there was no evidence of a seasonal epidemic of pneumonia in the future.
英国政府顾问瓦伦斯则表示，英国的疫情比意大利延后了三周，接下来英国的疫情走向也可能跟意大利类似：确诊病例迅速增加，直至感染人数达到一定数量。
The British government's advisor Lawrence Vallance said the British epidemic was three weeks behind Italy, and the epidemic is likely to follow Italy's lead: confirmed cases increase rapidly until a certain number of people become infected.
