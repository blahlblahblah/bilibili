义工分会只是挂靠在慈善总会下的一个分会，由一些自发做义工的人员组成，王丽并非温州慈善总会体制内人员，也不从慈善总会拿工资。
The Volunteer Club is an affiliate of the General Association of Philanthropy. It is made up of volunteers who are not members of the Wenzhou Charities Association and do not receive their salaries from the General Association of Charities.

”上述负责人称，王丽窃走的这批口罩是由王丽本人捐赠给浙江安福利生慈善基金会的，捐赠后，王丽得知有一家公益组织急需口罩分发给一线抗疫人员，便将捐赠口罩卖给对方，并希望用所得收入再购入一批口罩还给浙江安福利生慈善基金会。
Wang said the masks were donated by Wang herself to the Zhejiang Anfusheng Charity Foundation. After learning that a public welfare organization was in urgent need of masks for distribution to first-line anti-epidemic personnel, Wang sold the masks to the other party, hoping to use the proceeds to buy a new batch of masks and return them to the foundation.
随后，浙江安福利生慈善基金会的工作人员予以报警。

王丽盗窃的口罩出售或赠送的对象都是急需口罩等物资的抗疫一线人员，且将剩下的口罩免费赠送给各个社区、福利院等急需防疫物资的单位，没有私自藏匿，也没有高价销售，更没有倒卖给第三方，搅乱整体的物资防疫市场。
