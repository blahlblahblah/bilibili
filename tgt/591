我想说，我们再困难也会响应政府号召，去打赢这场新冠肺炎病毒阻击战！口述 | 李安定整理 | 金 姬我是70后上海人，生于斯长于斯。
I'd like to say that we'll respond to the government's call to win the New Crown Pneumonia Virus! I'm from Shanghai 70 years later, born in Sceaux.
大学毕业之后的十几年间，我主要从事机电设计顾问方面的工作，在美资、港资和内地几家大企业都做过。
Over the past decade or so, I have worked as a consultant in the field of electrical and mechanical design, both in the United States and Hong Kong, as well as in several large enterprises in the Mainland.
8年前，我开始创业，在上海开了一家建筑设计公司，主要给楼宇建筑做机电设计等工作。
Eight years ago, I started my own business. I started an architectural design company in Shanghai.
去年9月，随着公司业务的不断扩展，我们搬到了徐家汇，目前有员工20人，算是一家小微企业吧。
Last September, with the expansion of the company's business, we moved to Xujiahui, there are currently 20 employees, is a small micro-enterprise bar.
2019年公司搬到了新办公室两次危机化险为夷都说创业不易，公司成立8年来，我已经平稳度过两次大风浪。
The company moved to a new office in 2019. It was difficult to start a business. In the eight years since the company was founded, I have weathered two big waves smoothly.
第一次是2016年。
The first was in 2016.
大家应该还记得2016年先热后冷的楼市吧——年初“化解房地产库存，促进房地产业持续发展”被中央确定为“三去一降一补”的重点任务之一，房价一下子涨起来。
You should remember the hot and cold housing market in 2016 - "resolving real estate inventory, promoting sustainable development of the real estate industry" at the beginning of the year was identified by the central government as one of the key tasks of "three, one fall, one fill."
于是，7月、11月的两次中央政治局会议均提出“抑制资产泡沫”，下半年政府倡导“房子是用来住的，不是用来炒的”，楼市又冷了下去。
As a result, two Politburo meetings in July and November called for "asset bubbles to be contained," and in the second half the government advocated that "houses should be used for housing, not for stir-frying," and the housing market became cold again.
而我们当时的客户主要是地产商，所以服务的很多地产公司都停了项目。
Our clients were mainly real estate agents, so many of the real estate companies we served stopped working on the project.
对于我而言，当时每个月都是举步维艰，项目奖金基本没法发。
For me, it was a difficult month and the project bonuses were almost impossible to deliver.
这个过程大概有半年，直到我们后来把客户对象转向酒店旅游业，公司才渡过难关。
It took us about half a year until we turned our clients to the hotel industry and the company was able to pull through.
说实话，自从转战酒店业后，我们公司的业绩就开始蒸蒸日上了。
To tell you the truth, since the war on the hotel industry, our company's performance began to thrive.
忙的时候，项目都来不及做，人员也增加了三分之一。
Busy time, the project did not have time to do, personnel also increased by one-third.
公司的第二次危机是在去年中美贸易摩擦期间，我们的项目并没有之前那么好。
The company's second crisis came during last year's Sino-American trade frictions, when our program wasn't as good as it used to be.
但我们抓住了“一带一路”倡议的商机，在西部一些城市找到了酒店项目，总体还是趋于稳定并偏上，直至现在新冠肺炎疫情爆发。
But we have seized on the opportunity offered by the "One Belt, One Road" initiative and found hotel projects in a number of cities in the west, generally stabilizing and rising until the outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia.
2019年公司获得洲际酒店集团智选假日酒店最佳机电顾问奖项。
In 2019, the company won the Intercontinental Hotel Group Holiday Inn's Best Electrical and Mechanical Advisor Award.
春节欧洲游，差点回不了国忙了一整年，我很早就预定了今年春节陪老婆孩子跟团去西班牙、葡萄牙旅游。
Spring Festival in Europe, almost can not go back to the country busy all year, I booked this Spring Festival with his wife and children with the group to Spain, Portugal tour.
我们是1月21日从上海出发，当时钟南山刚刚宣布此次新冠肺炎会人传人。
We set out from Shanghai on January 21, just after Zhong Nan Shan announced the new crown pneumonia.
我们也没觉得有多可怕，到了国外就发现问题愈来愈严重，武汉封城了，国内口罩都断货了。
We do not feel how terrible, to find that the problem became more and more serious abroad, Wuhan closed the city, the domestic masks are out of stock.
所以大家每天玩起来也不是很尽兴，朋友圈都在讲武汉和新冠肺炎疫情的事，我和同事也都微信聊这个。
So everyone is not having fun every day, friends are talking about the outbreak of Wuhan and Xinguan Pneumonia, my colleagues and I have also written about this.
一开始到葡萄牙的时候，大家也都没戴口罩游玩。
When we first arrived in Portugal, we did not wear masks to play.
后来到了一个景点，据说边上是湖北过来的旅行团，我们就很紧张，全都戴上了口罩。
Later arrived at a scenic spot, said to be the edge of Hubei tours, we are very nervous, all wearing masks.
雪上加霜的是，我这次在国外旅游差点回不来。
To add insult to injury, I almost couldn't come back from my trip abroad.
旅行团原来买好德国汉莎航空2月2日的回程机票，可是随着国内新冠肺炎疫情越来越严重，汉莎航空从1月29日宣布停飞全部中国内地航线。
Lufthansa had bought a return flight on Feb. 2 from Lufthansa, but Lufthansa suspended all flights to China on January 29 as the domestic outbreak of pneumonia deepened.
大家手忙脚乱只能改搭阿联酋航班回来。
People scrambled to get back on UAE flights.
当时庆幸，幸好自己跟团游，如果自助游，估计回国机票都抢不到。
Fortunately, I was lucky to travel with the group, if the self-help tour, it is estimated that no ticket home.
我们在西班牙机场，还自告奋勇帮浙江一个民间团体带一些口罩和防护服回国。
At the Spanish airport, we volunteered to help a civil society group in Zhejiang bring back some masks and protective clothing.
我们每人有30公斤的行李托运限额，除了自己行李，剩下的行李重量指标尽量留给托运的防疫物资用，也算为国内抗击新冠肺炎疫情尽点绵薄之力。
Each of us has a baggage allowance of 30 kilos, and the remaining baggage allowance, in addition to our own baggage, is reserved for the consignment as much as possible for the domestic fight against the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic.
让大家担心的是，飞机上还有二十几个湖北人。
To everyone's concern, there are more than two dozen Hubei people on the plane.
所以回国后的检验检疫流程就很麻烦，我现在也自觉在家隔离。
So the inspection and quarantine process after returning home is very troublesome, and I am now conscious of isolation at home.
公司最艰难的时刻最让我担心的是，我们公司在内地很多项目很难年后正常开工，因为一些城市都封了，农民工都回不去了。
What worries me most about the company's toughest times is that many of its projects on the mainland are hard to get started by year's end, because some cities are closed and migrant workers can't go back.
我回来后让项目经理一个一个电话问过了，我们参与设计的所有在建项目都不知何时复工。
When I got back, I asked the project manager one by one when all the construction projects we were involved in designing would go back to work.
其实不是我一家，我们这一行对此次新冠肺炎疫情造成的影响都很着急。
It's not really my family. Our industry is worried about the impact of the new outbreak of pneumonia.
做我们这一行的主要集中在北京、上海和深圳三地，上海大概有同行大大小小几十家吧。
The main focus of our business is in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, Shanghai has probably dozens of colleagues large and small bar.
大家一致认为上半年新的项目不会开工，旧的项目何时复工也说不准，应收账款也难以收回。
It was agreed that no new projects would start in the first half of the year, that there would be no certainty as to when old projects would resume and that receivables would be difficult to collect.
我这样的小公司，最大的开销是人力成本，干我们这一行的都是资深专业人士，人工并不便宜。
For a small company like me, the biggest expense is manpower costs. The people in our field are all senior professionals, and labor is not cheap.
房租大概只占到支出10%，所以即便政府出台减免租金的政策，纾困效果也有限。
Rents account for only about 10% of spending, so even with the government's rent relief, the relief has been limited.
根据《中欧商业评论》刊发的清华、北大联合调研995家中小企业的报告，受此次新冠肺炎疫情影响，85.01%的中小企业维持不了3个月生存。
According to a report on 995 SMEs jointly conducted by Tsinghua and Peking University published in the China-EU Business Review, 85.01% of SMEs could not survive for three months due to the outbreak of pneumonia.
我让公司财务算过，按照目前的流动资金，最多也只能撑三个月。
I had the company's finances calculated that, given the current liquidity, it would only last three months at most.
如果三个月后情况没有改善，我不得不降薪或裁员。
If things don't improve three months from now, I'll have to cut back or cut jobs.
和前两次风浪相比，我觉得目前是公司最艰难的时刻。
Compared to the last two waves, I think this is the toughest time for the company.
按照上海市政府规定，我们企业下周一（2月10日）复工，但像我这样的还要在家继续隔离，还有一些外地员工都还没回来。
According to the Shanghai municipal government, our company will resume work next Monday, Feb. 10, but people like me will have to stay at home.
虽然项目都没恢复，人员都没到齐，但我五险一金还是要发的。
Although the project did not resume, the personnel did not arrive, but I almost one gold or five will be issued.
其实，企业在每个员工身上花的钱是员工工资的 1.5-1.7倍，多出来的钱，绝大部分缴纳了社保、公积金、场地费。
In fact, enterprises spend 1.5 to 1.7 times the wages of employees, the majority of the money out of the social security, provident fund, site fees.
此次疫情下，政府若有相关减负政策出台，我们也许可以多撑一阵子。
This epidemic, the Government if the relevant burden reduction policy, we may be able to stay for a while.
2月8日，《上海市全力防控疫情支持服务企业平稳健康发展的若干政策措施》出台，其中主要租金方面的政策对我们这样的小微企业有实实在在的帮助。
On February 8, the "Several Policies and Measures for the Steady and Healthy Development of Shanghai's Outbreak Prevention and Control Support Service Enterprises" was issued, among which the major rent-related policies are of practical help to small and micro-enterprises like ours.
至于其他内容，需要复工后让同事去具体核实一下。
As for the rest, we need to ask our colleagues to check it out after we get back to work.
