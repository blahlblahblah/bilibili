很多人报名，但没有一个人提条件，没人问工资是多少，这让她尤为感动。
She was particularly moved by the large number of people who signed up without imposing conditions or asking how much they were being paid.
“我说咱们是去奉献，没有讨价还价的余地，但国家肯定不会亏待大家。
"I say we are giving, there is no room for bargain, but the country will certainly not be unkind to you.
有人说，不给钱都无所谓。
Some people say it doesn't matter if you don't pay.

腊月二十八，口罩需求量井喷，李江丽和薛巧娜从这一天早8点，一直工作到第二天早9点，连续工作24小时，“最难熬的是黎明那会儿，时间过得特别慢，坐得太久，整条腿都是麻的，人也特别困，等天一亮，人反而精神了。
Li Jianli and Xue Qihona worked 24 hours a day from 8 a.m. on this day until 9 a.m. the next morning. The hardest part was when the dawn passed so slowly that the whole leg was numb and the man was very poor
”李江丽说。

She goes out at 7 every morning and comes home tired at 9pm. Her son is almost asleep.
忆及家人，两名女工潸然泪下，“亏欠家人，但是一想，跟一线的医护人员比，我们回家还能拥抱自己的孩子，他们只能隔空拥抱，他们比我们苦多了。
Recalling their families, the two women workers burst into tears. "I owe them to my family, but I think we can hug our children when we go home compared to the front-line staff.
”李江丽说，为了赶制口罩，20个白班姐妹全部到岗，无一人缺勤。
Li said all 20 daytime sisters were on duty to make masks, and no one was absent.
“大家都很累，我以前觉得自己就是一个普通女工，没想到能派上这么大用场，我们多生产一片口罩，就多给前方医护一点保障，医护人员是战士，我们就是他们的后勤，我很自豪。
"We were all very tired. I thought I was an ordinary female worker. I didn't expect to be able to put it to such a good use.
”为了给工人打气，年三十下午，丁栾镇党委书记、镇长来到健琪公司，给140位女工发红包，一人一百元，感谢她们舍小家为大家，“政府官员给普通工人发红包，这是第一次。
"To cheer the workers up, the party secretary and mayor of Luan came to the Jiangqi Company in the afternoon and handed out red envelopes to 140 women workers, one for 100 yuan each, thanking them for giving up their homes for everyone.
”田书增说。
'he said.
这天晚上，工厂提前一个小时下班，让女工回家吃年夜饭。
That night, the factory closed an hour early to let the girls go home for New Year's Eve dinner.
一切以生产第一，一切以女工第一。
All to production first, all with female workers first.
在一次动员会上，华西卫材老总许诺，“想上夜班上夜班，想上白班上白班，如果觉得伙食不好，立马调整伙食，觉得机器不好使，立马换机器。
At a mobilization meeting, Huaxi Wei Shi boss promised, "to work night shift, want to attend daytime class, if food is not good, immediately adjust food, feel bad machine, immediately change machine.
”女工们没白没黑地干，田书增也担心撑不住，2月3日，他专门给养殖场和屠宰场打电话，让现杀两头猪，给女工加营养，“食堂一直用的冷冻肉，肯定不如新鲜肉有营养。
On February 3, he made special calls to farms and slaughterhouses to have two pigs killed and female workers nourished. "The frozen meat that has been used in the cafeteria is certainly not as nutritious as fresh meat.
”━━━━━“咱企业就算都赔进去，能换来疫情赶快过去，也值了”2月3日，每隔几分钟，田书增的电话就响起来，打电话的都是各地疾控中心、医院、卫生局的领导，还有各地的业务员，“张口就是，能弄几箱口罩吗？”田书增挨个道歉。
Feb. 3, the telephone rang every few minutes, all the leaders of the CDC, hospitals, and health authorities, as well as the sales staff everywhere, "Can we get some cases of masks?" Tian apologized one after the other.

弄不到口罩，有的老客户跟田书增发了脾气，“说我不近人情，十多年的业务关系都不给货，我给他解释说，一线的医护人员都没有口罩，现在物资要统一调配。
I explained to him that the front-line medical staff did not have face masks, and that the supplies were now being consolidated.
”田书增很矛盾，“以前企业销售都要依靠这些老客户，现在都给得罪了，过后还得求着人家。
Mr Tian was ambivalent: "In the past, companies relied on these old customers for sales, and now they are offended and have to beg for help later.
”这种压力与矛盾，早在1月28日就已经让田书增难办了。
This pressure and contradiction, as early as January 28, has made Tian Shu difficult to do.
厂门口停着各地来拉口罩的救护车，山东、湖南、四川、甘肃、河北，田书增一概没见。
In front of the factory parked everywhere to pull masks ambulances, Shandong, Hunan, Sichuan, Gansu, Hebei, Tian Shuzheng did not see.
29日凌晨1点，他在朋友圈里说道，“尊敬的各位远来的客人，现在确实没货给你们啊，要是在平时我会迎到大门口，接你们请你们喝茶再喝点小酒，可是现在你们不远千里来到长垣，我连面都不能见，在此真心说对不起了，特殊时期敬请谅解。
At 1: 00 a.m. on the 29th, he said in his circle of friends, "Distinguished guests from afar, we do not have them now. If I had met you at the gate for tea and a little wine, but now that you have come a long way, I cannot even see you, I sincerely apologize for the special time.

From the twenty-sixth of December until now, Tian Shuzheng has slept four hours a day at most, his eyes are red-eyed.
”马全建也全天盯在厂区，办公室里放着一大箱方便面，还剩几盒。
Ma also spent the whole day staring at the plant, with a large box of instant noodles in his office and a few boxes left.
各地上百份的公函也纷至沓来，都是协调口罩的。
Hundreds of official letters poured in from all over the world, all coordinating masks.
需求勐增，但长垣首先要保证一线。
Demand Mengzheng Mengzheng, but Changyuan first to ensure a line.
1月29日，国务院应对新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情联防联控机制（以下简称“国务院联防机制”）医疗物资保障组直接对企业下发通知，对生产企业派驻特派员，“负责监督物资的统一管理、统一调拨”。

”“保质保量，不计成本，最大限度保证物资供应。
"" Quality and quantity, regardless of cost, to ensure the maximum supply of materials.
”马全建如此形容目前企业的状态。
Ma described the state of the company as such.
长垣市指挥部介绍，为了保证口罩价格不暴涨，维护市场稳定，市场监督管理局对口罩等防护用品进行监管，医用外科一次性口罩出厂价以前5毛钱一个，现在维持在8毛钱左右。
Changyuan City Command said, in order to ensure that the price of surgical masks do not skyrocket, to maintain market stability, the market supervision administration and other protective equipment, medical surgical disposable surgical masks before the factory price of a 50 cents, now maintain around 80 cents.
但随着原材料涨价、物流成本和工人三倍工资，企业压力增大。
But with raw-material prices rising, logistics costs tripling workers' wages, corporate pressure is mounting.
“生产口罩最重要的过滤材料熔喷布，以前一吨一万多，现在涨到了三万多，只能赔钱生产。
"The most important filter material used to make masks is the melting pot, which used to be more than a ton, but now it has grown to over 30,000 and has to lose money to produce.
”田书增说。

On January 31, the enterprise mobilization conference, Tian Shuzheng mobilization middle and high-level overtime to produce masks, sales staff reported that the company has been losing money, half of the middle and senior leaders cried.
“我跟他们解释说，国家不安小家不宁，战士上战场就没考虑过回来，咱企业就算都赔进去，能换来疫情赶快过去，也值了，现在不是考虑得失的时候。
"I explained to them that the country was restless, that the soldiers had not considered returning to the battlefield, and that even if we were to pay for it, we would trade the disease for quick passage, and that it would be worth it.
”田书增说。
'he said.
可两天后，田书增自己又哭了一场，“累死了还得干，难为的呗。
But two days later, Tian Shu added to his own tears, "tired to death have to do, difficult to do."
”━━━━━“企业围墙以外的事政府来解决”2月3日下午，接连不断的电话中，一个电话让田书增愁眉略展，“市里来电话，让去领50万补贴，给工人发工资。
"--James Russell" Things Beyond the Wall for Businesses "On the afternoon of Feb. 3, a telephone call made Tian look sad." The city phoned to get half a million dollars in subsidies to pay workers.
”几天前，长垣市政府划拨的专项资金也已到位，算是低息贷款，保证企业开工。
A few days ago, the municipal government of Changyuan also allocated special funds, regarded as low-interest loans, to ensure that enterprises start work.
在此前的一次紧急会议上，长垣市委、市政府召集有关局委办负责人，与42家卫材企业代表开会，解决企业困难。
At a previous emergency meeting, the Changyuan municipal committee and the city government called a meeting with representatives of 42 satellite enterprises to resolve enterprise difficulties.
“企业围墙以外的事政府来解决,企业不要操心生产以外的事”，长垣市委书记秦保建在会上要求，除了服务企业和解决问题的部门，其他部门一概不能上门干扰企业生产。
"Matters outside the walls of enterprises should be settled by the government, and enterprises should not worry about anything other than production," said Qin Baojian, the party secretary of the Changyuan Municipal Committee.
整个长垣动员起来：上千名女工从农村走进车间，社区和村干部帮助招工，20辆公交车专门接送女工上下班，6辆应急发电车和1台应急发电机待命，15000斤肉蛋米面菜油专门供给企业食堂，33张应急物资及人员车辆通行证发给企业，金融机构向卫材企业投放6亿资金，为了解决原材料紧张，河南省领导出面跟相关上游厂家协调。
