This Spring Festival I bought a respirator in Iran, and a table traveler on a trip to Iran & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
本文系用户投稿，不代表机核网观点前言：世路寒 是我一位在桌游圈里的朋友，本职工作之外他是一位桌游设计师，同时还是上海SHM桌游展的主办人。
He is a friend of mine in the table tennis circle. Besides his job, he is a desktop designer and organizer of SHM exhibition in Shanghai.
生活中除了桌游他的另一个爱好大概就是旅行了，用他的话说自己是个待不住的人。
His other hobby in life, besides table-surfing, was probably travelling, and in his own words he was a person who couldn't stay.
而在今年春节前一如往常，世路寒果然没待在上海而是选择了只身前往不久前还是国际话题聚焦热点的中东国家——伊朗。
As usual before the Spring Festival this year, ShiLou did not stay in Shanghai, but chose to go alone to the Middle East, which until recently was a focus of international discussions - Iran.
当然，这趟原本的旅行展开方式却和世路寒原本计划的有些不同，尤其是猜得中开头却万万没有猜中结尾，一场突如其来的疫情让这次伊朗之行增添了无数变数…… 。
Of course, the original way the trip unfolded was a little bit different from what Shi Lu had planned, especially since the beginning of the book was not guessed at the end, and a sudden outbreak added a lot of variables to the trip...
注：由于本文内容来自于我通过微信对 世路寒 的采访，为了阅读方便，我将我们两人的对话整理成了文章并以受访人的第一人称为视角叙述出来。
In order to facilitate reading, I have arranged the dialogue between the two of us into an article and described it from the perspective of the interviewee's first person.
——瞬间思路 计划中的旅行与计划外的状况春节会去伊朗旅行源自之前曾在伊朗首都德黑兰的两次转机，当时乘坐伊朗马汉航空的飞机去欧洲，在转机通道上都挂满了伊朗各地的风景照片，这勾起了我的好奇：这些都是什么地方？我有没有机会能去看看？这大概就是最初的好奇心所埋下的种子吧。
A trip to Iran for the Spring Festival originated on two previous trips to Tehran, Iran's capital, when a plane from Iran's Mahan Airlines headed to Europe and featured pictures of scenes from all over Iran on the transit route raised my curiosity: What are these places? Do I have a chance to see them?
而真正确定行程是去年十一假期从俄罗斯回来后规划春节旅行的时候，定下了要去伊朗。
The real itinerary was planned for the Spring Festival holiday from Russia on the 11th of last year, when I decided to go to Iran.
这期间虽然经历了苏莱曼尼被杀引发的军事冲突危机，但伊朗并没被各国定为旅行危险目的地国，所以虽然心里有忐忑最终还是决定照原计划出发。
Despite the military crisis triggered by the killing of Suleimani, Iran was not designated as a destination for dangerous travel, so with some trepidation, it decided to proceed as planned.
而且巧的是当时联系上了几位同要去伊朗的驴友，他们有完整的自由行计划，于是想了想我干脆也把机票定在1月23日和他们一同行动，这样跟着走就可以玩转伊朗众多景点，我只要跟着掏自己这部分费用就行。
It so happened that I got in touch with some of my fellow travelers who wanted to travel to Iran, and they had a complete freedom plan, so I thought I'd take the plane tickets with them on January 23rd so I could go and play with Iran's many attractions at my own expense.
而且其中有位上海的哥们可以一起拼住宿又节约了不少，这比我之前自己可能需要到当地报团之类的旅行方式优化了太多。
And one of my friends in Shanghai has saved a lot more by staying together than I might have needed to travel to a local newspaper group.
。
.
伊朗和中国有四个半小时时差，国土面积大约164.5万平方公里，全球排第17名也是相当广大。
Iran and China have a four-and-a-half-hour time difference, with a land area of about 1.645 million square kilometers.
所以一般游玩伊朗有东、中、西三条线路，其中中线最短和我们此次时间安排比较符合，10到12天就差不多可以走完其中也贯穿了很多历史城市，所以这就决定了我们在伊朗的主要路线方向。
So we usually have three routes: east, middle and west, and the shortest is our schedule, which runs through many historical cities in 10 to 12 days, so that determines our main route in Iran.
其实我之前对伊朗的了解并不算多，除了两次转机之外，其他大概都来自百度。
In fact, my previous knowledge of Iran is not much, except for two connections, other than the other presumably from Baidu.
首先是武侠小说里提到的波斯拜火教也就是 明教 那更是如雷贯耳，然后就是国际新闻里的各种消息了，那就一下又成了风声鹤唳草木皆兵的紧张氛围，被长期制裁的物资贫乏状况，以及人人黑袍的肃穆形象……但这次旅行之后我才知道这些都不是真正的伊朗。
The first is the Persian Zoroastrianism referred to in the swordsman's novels, which is the Caritas religion. Then comes the news in the international news. Then comes the jittery tension, the material poverty of the long-standing sanctions, and the solemn image of black robe for everyone.
。
.
另外，作为一个桌游人，我听说去年德国埃森桌游展上首次出现了一家伊朗公司引发了轰动，原来伊朗也是有人在玩桌游的！我也通过去年去埃森参展MYBG公司获得了这家伊朗公司的地址，准备可能的话顺便去摆放一下，看看伊朗的桌游到底是怎样的。
In addition, as a table visitor, I heard about the first appearance of an Iranian company at last year's Essen table show in Germany, where people were playing table games! I also got the address of the Iranian company by going to Ethan last year to attend the MYBG exhibition.
。
.
于是，大年二十九那天，我所乘坐的马汉航空航班从上海起飞飞往德黑兰，十个小时之后我踏上了伊朗的土地。
So on the 29th of October, my plane, Mahan, took off from Shanghai to Tehran, and ten hours later I set foot on Iranian soil.
打破固有印象的第一印象伊朗机场我并不陌生，但海关之外是什么样就是第一次见到了。
Breaking the stereotype of the first impression of an Iranian airport is no stranger to me, but what is outside customs is the first time I've seen it.
如前面所说，来之前我能得到的种种信息已经在我的脑海里拼凑出了一个想象中的“伊朗”，但修正这个想象的过程就从此刻开始。
As I said before, I've pieced together in my mind an imaginary "Iran," but the process of correcting it begins right now.
。
.
伊朗的第一印象绝对就是打破你的固有印象，本来我以为经历这么多年国际封锁伊朗人的生活可能会捉襟见肘，但其实并非如此，我们看到伊朗人的日常物资相当丰富。
Iran's first impression is absolutely to break your stereotype that I thought the international blockade of Iranians might be too hard to live after all these years, but that is not the case.
在当地的很多巴扎（市场）都非常热闹，店铺很多商品也充足，买卖的人们络绎不绝。
Many of the local bazaars (markets) are very lively, stores are plentiful and people are buying and selling.
。
.
这样的巴扎在每个城市都有很多，穿行其中有点回到我们九十年代许许多多商品店铺集中在一起的那种大市场最兴盛火爆的年代。
These bazaars are numerous in every city, and they're a bit of a return to the heyday of the big markets where so many of our stores were clustered in the 1990s.
并看不到想象中物资匮乏，生活凋敝的感觉，更没有不久之前还笼罩在战争阴云中的样子。
Not to see the imagined lack of material resources, the sense of life withering, and not so long ago still shrouded in the shadow of war.
。
.
第一次被伊朗人称为“亲”还真的吓了我一跳，咱这电商用语都传到这了？然后才知道，原来人家说的是“秦”这个发音，在伊朗称呼中国人就是“秦”。
It really startled me when the Iranians called them "relatives" for the first time, and I got the message from all over the world.Q: What do you mean by "Qin"?
当地人非常热情，老老少少路上都会和你打招呼问好。
Local people are very warm, the old and young people will greet you to say hello.
。
.
之前我们还担心当地如果在街上拍照拍到当地伊斯兰的女性会不会挨打？结果根本没有，人家都很热情，我们同去的那个哥们是摄影爱好者，拍得不亦乐乎，伊朗街上碰到路人无论男女都对我们的镜头毫无敌意，还非常热情配合，这和我们以为的那种排外警惕外来者的印象可谓大相径庭。
Before that, we were worried that if the local Islamic women were photographed in the street, they would not be beaten. They were very enthusiastic. The guy we went with was a photographer, and we met people in the Iranian streets who were not hostile to our cameras, either men or women.
。
.
伊朗人都知道中国的发展速度很快而且支持伊朗，是伊朗的朋友，我走过的这些国家中对中国人最为热情。
The Iranians are aware of China's rapid growth and support for Iran and are friends of Iran, and I have travelled through the countries with the greatest enthusiasm for the Chinese people.
其实我们常在网上看到全身蒙在黑袍里只露出眼睛的大多是上年纪的女性或者是在一些相对保守的城市（德黑兰等大城市的女性，尤其是年轻女性们穿着时尚，头巾也并不非要挡住脸和包住头发，反而更像是一种时尚的配件），但即使是她们如果你有困难求助也绝对不会拒之不理，比如去问路的话她们都会详细地给你指点。
In fact, we often see on the Internet that the only eyes covered in black is mostly elderly women or women in relatively conservative cities (Tehran and other large cities, especially young women wearing fashionable headscarves do not have to cover their faces and wrap their hair, but are more like fashion accessories), but even if you are in trouble they will never refuse to ask for directions.
。
.
像德黑兰这样的城市，很多人英文都非常好，甚至有些商业、旅游行业的从业者已经都已经在学中文。
In a city like Tehran, many people are very good at English, and even some in the business and tourism industries are already learning Chinese.
而且和我谈话的伊朗人大多很好奇在我们这些外国人眼中的伊朗是什么样，也能感到他们有很强的国家和民族荣誉感。
And most of the Iranians I spoke to were curious about what Iran looked like to us foreigners, and felt that they had a strong sense of national and ethnic honor.
。
.
至于大家关心的治安情况，我只能说我这十天里的所见所闻所感，觉得伊朗还是很安全的，并没有我们以为的那些混乱、暴力出现，就我个人来说感觉德黑兰这样的大城市治安感受不比上海差。
As for the security situation you are concerned about, I can only say that I have seen, heard and felt that Iran is still safe from the chaos and violence we thought it was, and that I personally feel no less secure than a big city like Tehran.
甚至，刚刚经历了战争阴云的伊朗街头都没看到什么军警，只偶尔才在街头看到过警察。
Even the streets of Iran, which has just experienced the cloud of war, have seen few military police, and only occasionally have they seen police in the streets.
换完钱你就找到了一夜暴富的感觉伊朗的货币叫 里亚尔，网上说和人民的兑换比率大约是1人民币兑换6000里亚尔，但我们在伊朗实际兑换到的是200人民币换了360万。
The Iranian currency is called rial, and the exchange rate with the people is about 1 RMB to 6,000 riyals, but what we actually exchange in Iran is RMB 200 for RMB 3.6 million.
对，三百六十万，也就是1块钱人民币换一万八千里亚尔，你没看错。
Yes, three or six hundred thousand, that is to say, eighteen thousand rials for one dollar.
所以在伊朗期间，我们使用的最小面值就是10万里亚尔，如果你想体验一夜暴富手握上亿巨资的感觉，伊朗可以满足你。
So when we were in Iran, we used a minimum face value of 100,000 riyals, and if you wanted to experience the feeling of a huge overnight fortune, Iran could satisfy you.
不过汇率会不断变化，一般来说路边有很多兑换店都可以换到还可以的汇率。
But the exchange rate is constantly changing, and in general there are many exchange shops along the road that can be exchanged for a redeemable exchange rate.
但遗憾的是当地用人民币兑换比较吃亏的，最好还是用美元，甚至出租、加油等等都可以直接使用美元，只是汇率不那么美好，总之去之前还是带好美金吧。
However, it is a pity that the local exchange rate is weaker than RMB. It is better to use US dollar directly, even to rent, refuel and so on.
。
.
我们住的当地五星级酒店才280人民币一晚，非常好的民宿也差不多240人民币，便宜的100块钱就够，类似咱们如家、汉庭的水平，如果有人一起分摊那就这部分支出就更低了。
Our local five-star hotel is only 280 yuan a night, very good residential almost 240 yuan, 100 yuan cheap enough, similar to our home, Hanting level, if someone shares that part of the expenditure even lower.
。
.
伊朗的 马汉航空 我乘坐过很多次，印象很好。
I've traveled a lot on Iran's Mahan Airlines, and I'm impressed.
这个航空公司是在2011年开始飞中国的，北京、上海、广州、深圳都有直航航线，如果在伊朗转机则能方便地前往中东和欧洲各国。
The airline started flying to China in 2011 and has direct flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as to countries in the Middle East and Europe if transiting Iran.
马汉的整体感觉大概介于 春秋 和 东航 之间，飞机确实有点旧，但整体性能不差，飞国际航线的都是波音的大飞机，飞行也很平稳。
Mahan's overall feeling is probably somewhere between Spring and Autumn and East China Airlines, the aircraft is a bit old, but the overall performance is not bad, the international flights are Boeing's big aircraft, flight is also smooth.
往返价格大约4000多根据季节会有上下浮动。
The round trip price is about 4000 and fluctuates according to the season.
马汉的服务很周到，尤其重点是餐饮很好而且会一直给你喂食，比如这趟旅行最少给喂三顿这很适合我！不过我因为订的晚以及临时改签的原因花了4800元，但同行其他人订得早，就只花了4200元，所以如果可能的话还是早下手为强。
But I spent 4, 800 yuan because of the late booking and the temporary change, but I only spent 4, 200 yuan when the others came early, so it would be better to start early if possible.
。
.
所以，如果不是有特殊情况的话，玩伊朗真的预算不高。
So, if there were no special circumstances, playing with Iran's budget would be modest.
但你看，既然说到特殊情况，那就得说说我这次遇到的特殊情况了……该说说口罩了， 这原本完全不在计划里和我同屋的哥们他的岗位就是负责应对公司的突发事件，所以在房间休息的时候他也一直在和国内同事保持联系，内容基本就是采买口罩的事情。
But you see, when it comes to special situations, it's time to talk about my special situation... Talk about masks, my roommate, whose job was to deal with company emergencies, so he kept in touch with his domestic colleagues during the break, basically buying masks.
这样头几天下来，我也受到影响，考虑是不是应该买些。
This first few days down, I was also affected to consider whether to buy some.
再加上关注到国内外的新闻和朋友圈的消息，疫情的紧张感无形中也开始对我产生了压力。
Coupled with the attention paid to the news at home and abroad and the news of friends, the tension of the epidemic began to exert pressure on me.
。
.
再加上当时伊朗的口罩还没有什么人大量采购，我们在伊朗旅行期间很多城市的店铺都能买到，价钱也很便宜，所以我觉得不如把口罩加入购买计划里去，不过要留到最后回国前到德黑兰的那一天再说。
And since there was not a lot of people buying masks in Iran at the time, we could buy them in many cities during our trip to Iran and the prices were very low, so I thought it would be better to include them in the purchase plan, but only on the day before we finally return to Tehran.
。
.
但是计划赶不上变化，或者说情况一直在不断变化。
But plans have not kept pace with change, or things have been changing.
我们在行程后期到了伊朗古都也是伊朗中部的大城市 伊斯法罕，住的地方恰好旁边是当地医疗器械一条街，店铺很多。
We arrived in Isfahan, Iran's ancient capital and central city, right next to a street of local medical equipment and a lot of shops.
其实，当时我已经接到了国内公司发来的采买委托书，临危受命为公司采购口罩，加上同屋的哥们也是给公司购买所以我们的采购需求突然变得很大。
In fact, I had received a letter of authorization from a domestic company to purchase masks for the company, plus our roommate is also buying for the company, so our procurement needs suddenly became very large.
加之那会我们看到在其他国家买口罩越来越不容易，觉得不如干脆在伊斯法罕买一些，如果回到德黑兰买不到就傻了么。
And that would make it harder and harder for us to buy masks in other countries, and would be better off buying some in Isfahan than in Tehran.
。
.
但不巧的是伊朗的休息日是周四周五，而不是周六周日，我们到伊斯法罕恰好赶上人家休息日，于是我们两个老爷们决定临时取消第二天行程，留在伊斯法罕买口罩，让同行的另外两个妹子继续去按计划游玩，后来的事实证明这个决定正确无比。
Unfortunately, the day off in Iran was Thursday Friday, not Saturday Sunday, and we went to Isfahan just in time for the day off, so the two of us decided to cancel the next day's trip and stay in Isfahan to buy a mask, leaving the other two sisters on their way.
。
.
结果第二天伊斯法罕的采购过程真的很紧张，当地普通医疗口罩50个一盒，N95则是10到12个一盒，我们进店都是几百盒、几百盒的买，大部分店根本没有需要临时调货。
As a result, the next day Isfahan was really nervous about buying 50 boxes of normal medical masks, 10 to 12 boxes for N95, hundreds of boxes and hundreds of boxes for most of our stores.
就在这个期间，口罩的价格就在一直涨，每个店家老板都在不停地接电话，内容关键词全都是“口罩”。
In the meantime, the price of masks has been rising, with every shopkeeper answering phones with the key words "masks."
我们在后面几天跑了三个城市的四五十家店，因为不是所有店家都会英文所以沟通起来又耽搁了不少时间，而口罩价格几乎就随着我们的购买过程在不断提升。
We ran 40 or 50 stores in three cities over the next few days, because not all the stores spoke English so communication took a while, and the price of masks increased almost as we purchased them.
。
.
最早在伊斯法罕一家店买给你的口罩价格，到后面一家就涨了，这就像在电脑城里什么设备缺货，比如内存条那么几乎所有店家都会不停地接到内存条的问询和订货电话，你甚至能感到分分钟就有售罄的势头。
The price of your mask first bought at an Isfahan store has gone up at the latter. It's like being out of stock in a computer town where almost every store gets a lot of inquiries and orders from a memory slip and you can even feel like every minute is running out.
到最后不但价格翻了十倍，而且甚至还有当地商人来和我们收购，大有要炒起来的架势。
By the end of the day, not only did the price increase tenfold, but even the local businessmen came to buy it from us.
至于最后回到德黑兰几乎都买不到了，我们能运回国的口罩主要都来自伊斯法罕。
As for the last return to Tehran is almost impossible to buy, we can return to the country mainly from Isfahan masks.
最后几天我们几乎都在压缩旅游时间改为采买口罩，直到不得不去机场为止。
In the last few days we almost always switched to buying masks when we had to travel to the airport.
没现金，山穷水尽疑无路这次旅游我的计划是穷游，因为之前看过一个1500人民币玩转伊朗的攻略，所以我这次就带了2400人民币和600美金。
My plan for the trip was to go poor because I had seen a 1,500 yuan maneuver to Iran, so this time I brought 2,400 yuan and 600 dollars.
这些钱玩转伊朗其实真的够了，但要突然完成口罩的购买任务就一下变得捉襟见肘。
That's enough money for Iran, but the task of suddenly completing the purchase of the mask is quickly overstretched.
再加上伊朗不能用银联卡，也不能用VISA和MASTER，当然支付宝微信付款更是梦话，甚至国内朋友给我微信转账都无法接收。
Coupled with Iran can not use the bank card, nor VISA and MASTER, of course, paypal micro-payment is also a dream, even domestic friends to me micro-mail transfer can not accept.
外国人在伊朗几乎只能靠现金交易，这下我就有点傻眼了。
Foreigners in Iran almost exclusively rely on cash transactions, this makes me a bit silly.
幸亏同屋的哥们原本就要为公司采购口罩，所以美金带得不少，能给我匀出一些，才算救急。
Fortunately, the roommate would have to purchase masks for the company, so the United States dollar brought a lot of, can give me some free, just calculate emergency.
TIP：期间我们还联系上在伊朗的中国人看能否帮忙，沟通很好对方也都愿意帮忙，但由于时间紧迫加上我们一直在从伊斯法罕 向 德黑兰 移动无法停留等人，所以这个办法最终没能成功。
We also contacted the Chinese people in Iran to see if they could help, to communicate well, and to help each other, but due to time constraints and the fact that we had been moving from Isfahan to Tehran without being able to stop, this approach ultimately failed.
。
.
不过，买口罩只是一个方面，要把这些口罩运回来还要有运费的问题，我们在当地买了两个大包已经先拆掉了很多口罩的外盒包装塞进包里，塞不下的装箱打包。
But buying masks is only one facet, and there are freight costs involved in bringing them back. We bought two large bags in the area that had already removed many of the masks and packed them in boxes that didn't fit.
这些显然是大大超过免费托运范围的。
These are clearly well in excess of the free consignment coverage.
马汉航空的托运费用标准是每公斤100人民币，我们这些东西过过秤足有118公斤，那就是11800。
The standard shipping fee for Mahan Airlines is Rmb100 per kilogram. We've overweighed these items by 118 kilos, which is 11800.
另外口罩这种东西本身不重可包装非常占地方，如果是按照体积收费那就更不知道要花多少钱，所以即使有了现金我们也不敢都用掉。
In addition, the mask itself is not heavy packaging can take up a lot of space, if the volume of charges then do not know how much it costs, so even when we have cash we do not dare to use it.
这就很像在玩个桌游，你要为未来的某个阶段付费，但你不知道费用是多少，只能提前预估出来，留多了可能减少了购买能调用的资源，留下少了到最后可能之前买的又要丢弃损失一部分，所以留多少这真的很为难。
It's a lot like having a table game where you pay for some stage in the future, but you don't know how much it will cost. You just have to anticipate it in advance.
。
.
我们甚至打算到机场见到有中国人豁出脸去和人家借钱，大家都一班飞机回上海我们也跑不掉，大不了把护照身份证之类押给人家，落地就可以转账还钱了。
We even plan to go to the airport and see Chinese people go to the airport and borrow money. We can't get away with a flight back to Shanghai.
总之，就这样在忐忑不安中，我们迎来了回国的那天。
In short, in this way in anxiety, we ushered in the day of return.
找托运，柳暗花明又一村前面说的118公斤口罩我们打包了十六、七箱，这明显没办法背着走，所以干脆在伊斯法罕包了一辆皮卡随行了三天，留一个人在车上押车，其他人则叫了辆出租车同行。
We packed 16 or 7 cartons of the 118-kilogram mask we said in front of the village, obviously unable to carry it, so we packed a pickup truck with us for three days in Isfahan, leaving one to guard the car and the others to take a taxi.
这个皮卡车的司机不懂英语，经常要靠出租司机电话帮我们中转翻译，期间皮卡还因为超速被警察拦下，当时真吓得心惊肉跳，要是东西被扣了可怎么办！？幸好没出现这个情况，真是万幸。
The driver of the pickup truck, who doesn't know English, often has to rely on a taxi driver to help us with our transportation.The pickup truck was stopped by the police for speeding, and what if something was held upFortunately, we were lucky it didn't happen.
。
.
TIP：这辆皮卡的费用是50美元一天，最后又给了司机5美元小费外加路上请司机一起吃饭。
TIP: The pickup cost $50 a day, then tipped the driver $5 and invited the driver to dinner on the way.
。
.
由于担心托运问题，我们提前七个小时就到了机场。
We arrived at the airport seven hours ahead of schedule because of concerns about shipment.
一到机场就看到了很多堆在一起的箱子都是中国人买到要运回国，我们当时就觉得悬了，这么多人要托运，恐怕不容易，而申请托运额度要至少提前两天。
When we arrived at the airport, we saw a lot of boxes piled up by the Chinese to be shipped back to China. We felt so hung up that it was difficult for so many people to check in.
当时我们都做好了如果实在运不上飞机就恐怕真要扔一批的心里准备，但天无绝人之路，我们遇到一个惠州来伊朗自由行的妹子。
At that time we were all ready to throw a lot of money if we couldn't get the plane, but we met a sister from Huizhou who came to Iran freely.
。
.
这位妹子也是心怀大爱的能人，她在伊朗听说了国内的疫情之后就主动和国内所在街道取得了联系，想采购一些口罩回去捐赠，所以街道给她开了公函证明，她拿到证明当时就立刻联系马汉航空并申请到了42箱500公斤的免费托运额度。
She had contacted her street in Iran to buy some masks for donation, so the street certified that she had contacted Mahan immediately to obtain the certificate and applied for a free consignment of 42 boxes of 500 kg.
不过由于当时是预估，妹子也不知道到底能买到多少口罩所以这个数字其实估得很高，最后妹子自己单枪匹马采购到了17箱大约120公斤，额度还有很多富裕，听说我们的情况后就主动表示可以让给我们额度，这一下就解决了燃眉之急。
However, since it was estimated that my sister would not know how many face masks she could buy, the figure was very high. Finally, she bought 17 cases of about 120 kg by herself.
随后又有一些在机场碰到的国人很快凑满了全部额度，到这心里总算松了口气，可我们不知道这一波刚平却还有一波正要又起……八方支援各种帮助，谢谢！前面说到解决了托运额度问题，但没想到出关还是遇到了麻烦。
We were relieved to learn that this wave of equality was still on the way up again... Thank you for all the help we had received, but we didn't realize that we were still having trouble getting out of the airport.
德黑兰机场海关的一个工作人员表示我们这些口罩不能放行（伊朗2月3日发文暂停医用口罩出境，但当时是2月2日可能伊朗海关已经先得到了通知开始执行了），虽然我们一再说明是马汉航空给予的医疗物资托运额度运回中国，但却无果。
A Tehran airport customs official said the masks could not be released (Iran issued a letter on February 3 suspending the exit of medical masks, but it was possible that Iranian customs had been notified of the start of implementation on February 2), although we repeatedly stated that the shipment of medical supplies from Mahan Airlines was sent back to China, but to no avail.
眼看登机时间临近，无奈之下，我和妹子先进去按照之前 马汉航空 的联络邮件所说找到了他们在机场的现场负责人 马迪姆经理。
Seeing the boarding time approaching, my sister and I went in first to find the manager of the airport scene, Madim, according to Mahan's previous contact email.
。
.
经理说知道这个情况没问题，但他们航空公司只能等我们东西出关他们才能接手，可我们现在的问题恰恰是卡在出不了关，这不就成了死扣了吗……没办法，只能进一步说明情况外加软磨硬泡，希望能获得这位经理的帮助，最后 马迪姆经理让我们出去整理好托运物资等他消息。
The manager said he knew it was all right, but their airline had to wait until we got our stuff out of the way before they could take over, but our problem was just getting stuck.
。
.
老实说当时心里真的七上八下，又是一小时过去，眼看登机时间越来越近 马迪姆经理 这边却没任何消息，就在我们不知如何是好准备另寻他法甚至联系大使馆的时候，问题突然解决了！。
Honestly, it was an hour before the boarding time got closer and there was no word from the manager, so when we didn't know what to do to find another way or even contact the embassy, the problem was resolved.
原来 马汉航空和伊朗海关协调帮忙设立了一条快速通道，不但我们的东西都可以快速安检出关登机，不用跟其他大队人马排队，而且这次所有要运回中国的口罩等医疗物资都从这边运进去一并解决了出关安检等问题。
It turned out that Mahan and Iranian customs co-ordinated to set up a fast lane where not only could our things be cleared and boarded quickly, without queuing up with the rest of the team, but all medical supplies, such as masks to be brought back to China, were transported in from here to solve security problems.
。
.
就这样，在 马汉航空 的帮助下，我们总算有惊无险地登机成功，坐到座位上的一瞬间我只觉得心里一块巨石总算落了地，终于能回家了，到家就好了。
In this way, with the help of Mahan Airlines, we finally managed to board the plane successfully. The moment I got to my seat, I felt like a huge rock had finally fallen to the ground in my heart.
事实上我原本因为国内假期加长的原因准备多在伊朗停留几天，再去几个地方，结果由于接到后面要停航的通知，飞往上海的航班2月2日是最后一班，才紧急改签成2月2日也就是我们最后乘坐的这班 W5087次航班。
As a matter of fact, I had planned to spend more days in Iran and a few more places because of the longer holidays at home. As a result, the last flight to Shanghai was scheduled for February 2 and was changed to flight W5087 on February 2.
但也因为这个原因才遇到那位惠州妹子解决了托运问题，再有马迪姆经理 解决了出关手续，只能说冥冥之中自有天意，希望能让我们能顺利把这些物资运回来吧。
But it was also for this reason that the Huizhou sister was able to solve the shipping problems, and the Madim manager solved the customs formalities, can only say that there is a hidden fate, hope that we can successfully transport these materials back.

这次真的要感谢惠州妹子，感谢马汉航空，感谢同屋的上海哥们，还有一路上所有给我们提供帮助的国内外的朋友们，他们中大多是素昧平生，甚至今后也不会有什么交集，但即使如此还是给我这个陌生人提供了热情的帮助和支持，在这里真的要说声谢谢！。
I really want to thank my sister Huizhou, Mahan Airlines, my Shanghai buddies, and all the friends at home and abroad who helped us along the way, most of whom have never met or even met in the future.
虽然突发情况不断出现，但所幸大都得以解决，这和我们办桌游展其实也很像，见招拆招的事情没个完。
Although the emergence of unexpected circumstances, but luckily most of the solution, this and our table show is similar to the fact that there are no end.
所谓逢山开路遇水搭桥，还真是有点异曲同工之妙，办展会的确够历练人。
The so-called Fengshan Road bridge with water, but also a bit like the same thing, the exhibition is really enough experience.
最后，说个遗憾的事，因为最后要搞定口罩的事所以也没能去拜访德黑兰的那家桌游公司。
Finally, I'm sorry to say that I didn't make it to the table-games company in Tehran because of the last thing I had to do with my mask.
路上我和伊朗的年轻人聊过，他们说在伊朗的确是有不少人玩桌游的，不但有 双陆棋 那样的传统游戏，也有我们熟悉的现代桌游。
On the way, I talked to young Iranians, who said that there are indeed many people playing table games in Iran, not only traditional games like checkers, but also modern table games that we are familiar with.
不过伊朗没有桌游吧这种地方，桌游娱乐一般都是包含在咖啡馆里，看来这些内容只能留到下次再访伊朗的时候一探究竟了。
But there's no table tennis in Iran. Desks, games, and entertainment are usually included in the coffee shop, and it seems to be reserved for the next visit to Iran.

用一句话来总结这次经历吧：波澜起伏有惊无险，只要坚持初心，虽有波折也终能云开雾散。
Summarize the experience in one sentence: ups and downs of the adventure, as long as the initial heart, although the ups and downs can also be scattered.
一切都会好起来，加油！TIP：就在撰稿时获悉 由于阿联酋、土耳其、卡塔尔等航空公司拒绝中国乘客登机出境，所以很多中国人滞留在土耳其伊斯坦布尔机场，这时又是 马汉航空伸出了援手，将中国乘客运回伊朗，然后再从伊朗送回国内。
At the time of writing, it transpired that many Chinese were stranded at Istanbul airport in Turkey because airlines such as the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Qatar refused to allow Chinese passengers to board and leave the country.
这里真的要给马汉航空 点个赞，希望疫情早日结束一切平安之后，也能搭乘马汉航空 来一次伊朗之旅。
Here is a real tribute to Mahan Airlines, hope that the epidemic will soon end all peace, can also take a Mahan air trip to Iran.
最后，其实采访中还有很多内容，因为篇幅和主题的原因这次没有全部收录文中，以后有机会再和大家分享。
In fact, there are a lot of content in the interview, because the length and theme of the reasons for not all of the text, and later to share with you.
