____作为母亲，我想代替他去；作为一名曾经的医生，我又觉得他得去一线，这是医生都有的使命感。
As a mother, I want to take his place. As a former doctor, I feel that he has to go somewhere.
____口述 |张家慧整理|王仲昀今天（2月12日）是儿子进入抗疫情一线连续奋战的第十天。
Wang Zhongyun (February 12) is the tenth day of his son's continuous battle against the epidemic.
此前，他每天要在隔离病房里工作六小时，下班后回到供他们医护人员居住的宾馆常常是凌晨3点。
Previously, he had to work six hours a day in the isolation ward and often returned to the hotel for their staff at 3 a.m. after work.
我年轻时是一名麻醉医生，现在是一名医生的母亲。
I was an anesthesiologist when I was young, and now I am the mother of a doctor.
我儿子1999年考上大学，读了八年医学专业，后来回到我们老家荆州。
My son was admitted to college in 1999, studied medicine for eight years, and then returned to our hometown of Jingzhou.
在新冠肺炎疫情暴发前，他是荆州市中医院骨科的一名副主任医师。
Before the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, he was a deputy director of orthopaedic department of Jingzhou Chinese Hospital.
这次疫情开始蔓延后，离武汉200公里的荆州，情况也非常严峻：截至2月12日22时，荆州确诊病例为1110人。
After the outbreak began to spread, the situation in Jingzhou, 200 kilometers from Wuhan, was also very serious: as of 2200 hours on February 12, there were 1110 confirmed cases in Jingzhou.
儿子虽然是一名骨科医生，但也时刻处于待命状态。
Although he is an orthopaedic surgeon, his son is always on standby.
尤其是1月底他开始参加医院为抗击疫情组织的专业培训，培训的同时，他也抽空去超市购买了纸尿裤，为接下来做好准备。
In particular, at the end of January he began to attend professional training organized by the hospital to fight the epidemic, and he took the time to buy diapers at the supermarket in preparation for the next day.
在儿子去医院前，我最后一次见到他是1月31日下午。
The last time I saw my son before he went to the hospital was on the afternoon of January 31.
平时我们家和儿子家住的地方相隔不远，就一条马路的距离，步行10分钟就能到。
Usually our home and son live a short distance apart, just a road, walking 10 minutes can be.
那天下午，我们在我家楼下的车库相见，当时大家都沉默了。
We met that afternoon in our downstairs garage, when everyone was silent.
那时我预感到他可能很快就要去一线，作为母亲，我想代替他去；作为一名曾经的医生，我又觉得他得去一线，这是医生都有的使命感。
I had a presentiment that he might soon be on his way. As a mother, I wanted to take his place. As a former doctor, I felt he had to go somewhere.
最终，这种复杂的心情让我说不出话。
In the end, this complex mood left me speechless.
2月2日，上午9点37分，儿子接到医院通知，需要进入隔离病区工作，他告知我后，我想去送送他，他爸不让我去，说不要去干扰他。
On 2 February, at 9.37 a.m., my son was informed by the hospital that he needed to work in the quarantined area. After he told me that I wanted to see him off, his father told me not to disturb him.
我本以为他可以在家吃个午饭再走，没想到接到通知后他就出发了。
I had thought he could eat lunch at home before he left, only to find out at short notice that he was leaving.
我记得那天荆州下着雨，天空雾蒙蒙的，就跟我的心情一样。
I remember that it rained that day in Jingzhou, the sky foggy, just like my mood.
Play受访者说，居住的小区出奇安静，道路无人的踪影，甚至连鸟儿都没有现身，人们彻底安静了，这是他一辈子少见的情形。
Play respondents said it was a rare occurrence in his life that the neighborhood was eerily quiet, the roads were deserted and even the birds did not show up.
儿子去了他所在的荆州市中医院。
His son went to Jingzhou Chinese Hospital where he was.
医院为应对疫情，现在分好几个病区，把重症和轻症的病人都分开了。
In response to the outbreak, the hospital is now divided into several disease areas, separating the seriously ill from the lightly ill.
儿子现在的工作就是在隔离病房诊疗病人。
My son's job now is to treat patients in isolation wards.
他每次排班都是六小时，但实际上时间要久一点，因为穿上和脱下防护服都不容易，要耗费比较长的时间。
He works six hours at a time, but in practice it takes a little longer because it's not easy to put on and take off the suit, and it takes a long time.
由于专业防护服脱下很麻烦，他们工作中基本不吃不喝，也不上厕所。
As professional protective clothing takes off very troublesome, they basically do not eat or drink at work, and do not go to the toilet.
儿子之前去买纸尿裤，也是出于这一点考虑。
My son used to buy diapers, and that's why.
有时候他的排班是晚上8点到凌晨2点，那他就得7点从宾馆出发。
Sometimes his shift is from 8pm to 2am, so he has to leave the hotel at 7am.
自从去一线工作开始，他就没回家，也没法回家。
He hasn't been home since he started working on the front line, and he can't go home.
他和同事都住在专门的宾馆。
He lives in a special hotel with his colleagues.
图为受访者儿子，防护服上写着姓名和“加油”我记得2月6日那天，儿子在隔离病区下夜班，回到宾馆洗漱完毕已经快凌晨3点。
Photo shows the interviewee's son, his name and "Come on" written on the protective clothing. I remember that on February 6, my son was on night shift in the quarantine area and returned to the hotel to wash and wash almost 3 am.
他还在微信上教我们怎样在网上买菜，反复交代我们如何操作。
He also taught us how to buy vegetables online and how to operate them over and over.
这让我想到，儿子小时候是抬起头听我说要怎么样、怎么样，有时我还会补充一句，听见没有！现在我们都听儿子的，他说什么就是什么，我们会点头称是，因为他是我们的顶梁柱。
It reminds me that when my son was a child, he looked up and listened to me, and sometimes I would add, Do you hear me? Now we all listen to our son, what he says, and we nod yes, because he is our pillar.
2月7日，人们的朋友圈刷爆了李文亮医生去世的消息。
On February 7, people's circle of friends blew up the news of Dr. Li Wenliang's death.
我看后心里好难受，不敢转发朋友圈，不想在这时候给儿子带来负能量的东西。
I feel terrible after looking at, dare not forward the circle of friends, do not want to bring negative energy to his son at this time of things.
作为父母，心疼归心疼，在这时候还是要做好孩子的坚强后盾，不拖孩子的后腿，支持儿子在一线的工作，鼓舞士气。
As parents, heartache back pain, at this point or to do a good job of children's strong backing, do not drag the children's hind legs, support the son in the front-line work, boost morale.
儿子这段时间在结束工作后，有时会发朋友圈。
When my son finishes his work, he sometimes sends out a circle of friends.
2月8日元宵节，他在朋友圈写道：“六日（隔离日）安！高高兴兴上班去，平平安安回家来！”有人以为他回家了，他回复是回宾馆，还没有结束，结束了隔离之后才能回家。
On February 8, the Lantern Festival, he wrote in his circle of friends: "On the 6th day (Isolation Day), happy to go to work and come home safe and sound.Some people thought he had gone home, but he replied that he was going back to his hotel.
那条朋友圈的配图是电影《喜剧之王》中一个场景， 张柏芝说：“看，前面漆黑一片，什么也看不到。
The picture of the circle of friends is a scene from the film "The King of Comedy." Look, there is nothing in front of you.
”周星驰说：“也不是，天亮后便会很美的。
"No, it will be beautiful after daybreak," Zhou said.
”我觉得，儿子时时在告诉自己和家人，黑暗即将过去，黎明就要来临。
I felt my son constantly telling himself and his family that the darkness was coming and the dawn was coming.
也就是同一天，儿子终于和我们视频了。
That same day, my son finally made a video with us.
那是他这10天来唯一一次和我们视频。
That's the only time he's been with us in 10 days.
我们之前微信上交流非常有限，他一直报喜不报忧。
We had very limited communication before, and he was always happy to have nothing to say.
当时我打开视频，看见儿子出现在我的手机里，眼泪一下子就掉下来了。
When I turned on the video, I saw my son appear in my mobile phone, tears suddenly fell.
我当时非常高兴，非常激动，以至于语无伦次，一直在说：“看见了，看见了。
I was so happy and excited that I kept saying, "I see, I see.
”我都没注意到我的视频镜头拿反了，还是儿子说他看到爸爸的脚，我才反应过来。
"I didn't even notice that my video was on the other side of the tracks, or that my son said he saw Dad's feet.
我细看他的眼睛有点肿，鼻梁上还有口罩压着的印痕，我说你鼻梁上还有印子呢，他说现在已经用创可贴了，贴上后再戴口罩就好多了。
I looked at his eyes a little puffy, and there were marks on his nose. I said you still had a print on your nose. He said it was a bandage.
可能听见了我哽咽的声音，他说：“没事没事，还好还好！”问到他吃了没有，他说放心，每天有盒饭吃，医院还发了酸奶、牛奶。
I may have heard the choking voice, he said: "Nothing's all right, all right!" Asked if he ate, he said rest assured that every day there is a box of rice, the hospital also issued yogurt, milk.
如果能出门，我多么想给他送点热饭、热菜和热汤。
If I could go out, I would like to bring him some hot rice, hot dishes and hot soup.
但现在是非常时期，只能忍着。
But these are exceptional times, which have to be endured.
他爸说，有吃就不错了！这几天，儿子还发来了医院的好消息，说是荆州中医院有病人即将要出院了。
These days, he also sent good news from the hospital that there were patients coming out of the hospital in Jingzhou.
我们知道后都很开心。
We were all happy when we knew.
感谢海南省派来医疗队支援我们荆州，我相信这些医学专家和医护人员，是他们无私奉献，不畏生死，充当着病人的“守护神”。
Thanking Hainan Province for sending medical teams to support us in Jingzhou, I believe these medical experts and medical personnel are selfless dedication, do not fear life and death, act as the "patron saint" of patients.
其实在我们家，除了我儿子，我的两个侄女同样奋战在抗击疫情的一线。
In fact, in our family, except my son, my two nieces are also fighting the frontlines of the epidemic.
她们俩都是护士，大侄女在荆州另一家医院，小侄女在广州。
They are both nurses. Their big niece is in another hospital in Jingzhou. Her niece is in Guangzhou.
几天前，有天晚上12点，我看见小侄女发朋友圈了，就知道她已经下班。
A few days ago, at 12 o'clock one evening, I saw my niece in a circle of friends and knew she was off duty.
我立即问道：“你今天上的什么班？”她回答：“在广州南站上班，给来往的旅客测体温。
I immediately asked, "What class are you in today?" She replied, "Working at Guangzhou South Station, taking temperature measurements for commuters.
”问她一天上几个小时的班，回答十二个小时，我心里咯噔一下，上这么久啊。
"Ask her about the hours of work a day and answer it twelve hours, and I thought," I think, "It's been so long.
不过心疼也只能放在心里，安慰她累了就早点休息吧。
But heartache can only keep in mind, comfort her tired on the early rest bar.
医生护士真的很累，希望小侄女远在他乡能照顾好自己，平平安安。
Doctors and nurses are really tired, hope that the little niece can take care of themselves, safe and sound.
受访者的小侄女我们家这三个孩子，在这次疫情面前，都是好样的！我特别能理解儿子，因为17年前遭遇SARS时，当时作为医生的我，也有过报名去一线的念头。
My three nieces and nieces were all very well in the face of the outbreak, and I particularly understood my son, because 17 years ago, when I was suffering from SARS, I, as a doctor at the time, had the idea of enrolling in the first place.
身为医生或护士，这种时候的使命感是很自然的，就是有那种忍不住的冲动。
As a doctor or nurse, the sense of purpose at times like this is natural, but there is a compulsion to do so.
我相信，这段经历对于儿子来说是一段永生难忘的历练，这在他的人生中也算留下了历史的印记。
I believe that this experience for his son is an unforgettable experience, which also left a mark of history in his life.
这次疫情，是我们和病毒斗争的一个比较漫长的过程。
This outbreak is a relatively long process for us to fight the virus.
我希望我们能够早日战胜疫情，病人们尽快痊愈。
I hope that we can overcome the epidemic as soon as possible, patients as soon as possible.
静等春暖花开，期盼儿子他们医护人员凯旋。
Quiet wait for spring blooming, hope their son their medical staff triumphant.
