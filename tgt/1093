卖口罩不挣钱，商家还有积极性吗?战“疫”仍在继续，口罩等医疗物资颇为紧缺，一些商家也趁机囤积居奇哄抬物价，相应部门对此也强力打击。
Are businesses still motivated to sell masks? The epidemic continues, medical supplies such as masks are in short supply, and some businesses are hoarding money to drive up prices.
然而湖北洪湖市日前对一家药店的处罚决定却引发热议，0.6元进的口罩仅卖1元却被罚超4万，而且没收超1万。
However, a disciplinary decision against a pharmacy in Honghu, Hubei Province, triggered a heated debate, with a fine of more than 40, 000 yuan for only 1 yuan and confiscation of more than 10, 000 yuan.
很多网友还称赞药店卖的是“良心口罩”。
Many netizens also praised drugstores selling "conscience masks."
事情有了新进展。
There has been a new development.
2月13日下午，洪湖市委宣传部向中国新闻周刊证实，已对上述处罚决定启动重新调查，调查结束后会在当地主流媒体公布调查结果。
On the afternoon of February 13, the Propaganda Department of the Honghu Municipal Committee confirmed to China News Weekly that a reinvestigation of the above-mentioned punishment had been initiated and that the results would be made public in the local mainstream media upon completion of the investigation.
之前有媒体报道称，洪湖当地纪委也介入其中，调查执法人员是否存在违纪情况。
Earlier media reports said that Hong Lake local disciplinary committee also involved in the investigation of law enforcement officials whether there are disciplinary cases.
官方：构成哄抬价格行为2月12日，一则有关口罩的处罚消息在互联网广为流传。
Official: constituting a bid to inflate the price Feb. 12, a news about the punishment of masks in the Internet widely circulated.
洪湖市华康大药房销售一次性口罩，购进价格0.6元/只，销售价格1元/只，洪湖市市场监督管理局调查后，认为其涉嫌哄抬价格，决定没收违法所得14210元，罚款人民币42630元。
Huakang Dispensary in Honghu City sold disposable masks at a price of 0.60 yuan / unit and a selling price of 1 yuan / unit. After investigating, the Honghu Municipal Market Supervision Authority decided to confiscate 14,210 yuan of illegal earnings and fine 42,630 yuan.
这则处罚信息是洪湖市委宣传部官方微信“今日洪湖”于2月9日公布的。
The punishment message was published on February 9 by Honghu Municipal Communications Department's official micro-letter "Honghu Today."
一些网友认为这是过度执法，称药店卖的是“良心口罩”，也有人认为“这是不干正事”，并调侃称有这样的口罩给我30个。
Some netizens called it excessive law enforcement, saying pharmacies were selling "conscientious masks," while others said "it wasn't business" and joked about giving me 30 such masks.
还有人怀疑事情并非如此简单，“卖三四元的不罚，罚卖一元的，这个肯定是卖太低了影响某些人的收益！”有的网友甚至直接贴出了官方媒体报道，“为防控疫情河南开封市集中采购了一批一次性口罩，每个单价2元每人限购3个”。
Some people suspect that this is not so simple: "Sell three or four dollars of impunity, penalty one dollar, this must be selling too low impact on some people!" Some netizens even posted the official media report, "To prevent the outbreak of Kaifeng City, Henan, a concentrated procurement of disposable masks, 2 yuan each purchase 3."
与被炒到3元4元，甚至20元一个的口罩相比，1元是真的“良心”。
Compared with the face mask that gets fired to 3 yuan 4 yuan, even 20 yuan a mask, 1 yuan is a real "conscience".
当天下午，洪湖市委宣传部官方微博“洪湖发布”出了关于此事的声明。
That afternoon, Honghu City propaganda department official micro-blog "Honghu release" issued a statement on the matter.
声明主要透露了以下几点事实：调查是因消费者投诉，时间为1月28日；口罩数量44000只，种类为一次性劳保用品；洪湖市华康大药房于今年1月23日从仙桃某公司购进，没有中文标识。
The statement mainly revealed the following facts: the investigation was launched on January 28 by a consumer complaint; the number of surgical masks numbered 44,000; and the Huakang Pharmacy in Honghu City was purchased from a company in Xiantao on January 23 without a Chinese label.
洪湖市市场监管局认为依据湖北省市场监管局《关于新冠肺炎防控期间有关价格违法行为认定和处理的指导意见》（简称《意见》）该药房违反两条规定：一是“公共卫生一级响应期间，与疫情相关的医用商品、防护消毒商品等一律不得涨价；二是所售商品无参照原价，购销差价额超过15%的，构成哄抬价格行为。
The Honghu Municipal Market Supervisory Authority considers that, according to the Guidance of the Hubei Provincial Market Supervisory Authority on the Identification and Handling of Price Infringement during the Prevention and Control of New Crown Pneumonia (hereinafter referred to as the "Opinions"), the pharmacy violated two provisions: "During the public health response period, medical commodities and protective disinfection commodities related to the epidemic situation shall not be raised.
”律师：有待商榷面对这样的声明，众多网友并不认同，有人算了一笔账：如果按照15%的规定，每只口罩最多只能卖0.69元，即使卖出全部口罩也才赚不到4000元。
Lawyer: A lot of netizens don't agree with the statement. Someone has made an account of the fact that under the 15 percent rule, a mask can only sell for as much as $0.69, or less than $4,000 if you sell all of them.
一位网友评论称，现实情况是一罩难求，这个利差以后谁还愿意去进口罩，说实话1元钱真的不贵，希望药店可以申请行政复议。
A netizen commented that the reality is a cover hard to get, who is willing to go after the interest rate difference, to tell the truth 1 yuan is really not expensive, hope pharmacies can apply for administrative review.
中国新闻周刊注意到，上述洪湖官方微博的声明与此前“今日洪湖”官方微信所发布内容略有不同。
China News Weekly noted that the above-mentioned Honghu official Weibo statement is slightly different from the previous "Honghu Today" official message released.
数量上“今日洪湖”称“华康大药房销售一次性口罩38000个”，而声明提到是44000个；种类上是一次性口罩，而声明称是一次性劳保用品，意指非医用口罩，且未有中文标识。
"Hong Hu today" said "38,000 disposable respirators sold by Huakang Pharmacies," compared with 44,000 in the statement. It was a disposable mask and the statement said it was a disposable one, meaning a non-medical mask with no Chinese logo.
律众律师事务所副主任吴萌告诉中国新闻周刊，即使按照湖北省市场监管局下发的《意见》，洪湖市场监督管理局的做法也是有待商榷的。
Wu Meng, deputy director of the law firm, told China News Weekly that even in accordance with the Opinions issued by the Hubei Provincial Market Supervisory Authority, the practice of the Hong Kong Lake Market Supervisory Authority was debatable.
他解释称，按《意见》规定1月22日起存在下列情形之一的，会被认定为哄抬价格：以2020年1月21日前商品销售价格或者提供服务的价格为原价，在1月22 日后超出原价销售或者提供服务的；商品进货成本发生变化，购销差额未与 1月21日前保持一致并扩大的；所售商品无参照原价，购销差价额超过15%的。
He explains that prices are deemed to be inflated if the original price of the goods sold or services rendered before 21 January 2020 exceeds the original price of the goods sold or the price of the services rendered after 22 January; if the purchase cost of the goods changes and the balance of purchase and sale does not coincide with that before 21 January; if the price difference exceeds 15 per cent.
而本次处罚引用了“所售商品无参照原价，购销差价额超过 15%的”条款，这说明其它两条款不适用。
The penalty cites a clause that says "the price difference for the goods sold exceeds 15% without reference to the original price," which means that the other two items do not apply.
“也就证明药店1月21日前并没有销售过口罩，而是在2020年1月23日进货后第一次销售口罩。
"It proves that pharmacies did not sell face masks before January 21, but sold them for the first time after they were purchased on January 23, 2020.
”既然是第一次定价，也就谈不上乱涨价的问题。
Since it was the first time prices were fixed, there was no question of wild price increases.
再者，《意见》是今年1月25日颁布实施的，而药店是1月23日购进口罩。
Moreover, the Views were promulgated on January 25 this year, and pharmacies bought masks on January 23.
如果药店是1月25日前就定好了价格，销售行为开始时湖北省的指导意见并未颁布实施，按照法不朔及既往的原则，不能处罚之前的行为。
If pharmacies set prices before January 25, Hubei province's guidelines at the start of the sale have not been promulgated or enforced, and pre-existing practices cannot be punished according to the principle of non-retroactivity.
当然，《意见》作为地方性的规定，在湖北省范围内是有效的。
Of course, the Opinions, as local regulations, are valid within the scope of Hubei Province.
如果在2020年1月25日法规生效之后再次出现违规行为，相关部门是有权进行处罚的。
If violations occur again after the entry into force of the Act of 25 January 2020, the relevant authorities are entitled to impose penalties.
不过对“涨价被罚”事件，也有不同看法。
However, there are also different views on the "price hike penalty" incident.
北京京师律师事务所律师许浩对媒体表示，处罚虽合规合法，但是否合理，即是否有违行政比例原则，需视具体情况商榷，“若药房能自证成本增加，应视情况而定不能机械执法。
Xu Hao, a lawyer at Beijing Jingshi Lawyers' Office, told the media that while the punishment was lawful, whether it was reasonable, i.e. whether it violated the principle of administrative proportionality, was debatable on a case-by-case basis.
”中国政法大学法治政府研究院院长王敬波接受媒体采访表示，这种处罚属于执法过度。
Wang Jingbo, dean of the government institute for rule of law at the Chinese University of Political Science and Law, told reporters the punishment was excessive.
疫情期间，各地政府虽应从重从快从严打击涉疫情产品的违法行为，但也要慎重执法。
During the outbreak, governments at all levels should severely crack down on illegal activities involving epidemic products, but they should also exercise caution in enforcing the law.
值得注意的是，一些专家认为疫情期间口罩某种程度上已成为“标配”，过度严厉地打击“乱涨价”，很可能导致商家供货中断，加重本就紧张的物资供应。
It is worth noting that some experts believe that masks have become "standard" to some extent during the epidemic, and that overly severe crackdowns on "wild price increases" are likely to lead to disruptions in business supplies, adding to already tight supplies.
金融研究院院长、首席金融学家管清友曾对中国新闻周刊表示，应严格区分因市场规律导致的涨价与恶意涨价，不能搞“一刀切”。
Guan Qingyou, director of the Financial Research Institute and chief financial scientist, told China News Weekly that a strict distinction should be made between price hikes and malicious price rises caused by market laws and that "no one size fits all."
坚决反对发国难财的行为，但对于一般基本物资涨价应予理解，这有利于保障物资供应，反之是在助长物资短缺，这是基本的经济学常识，即供需关系决定商品价格，涨价意味着稀缺。
Firmly opposed to the development of national wealth, but the price of basic goods in general should be understood as conducive to the security of supplies, and vice versa, which is the basic economic wisdom that supply and demand determine commodity prices and that rising prices mean scarcity.
被罚店主称是内部沟通问题据2月13日《羊城晚报》报道，被罚药店的经营者毛先生解释称，他并不支持口罩卖高价，被罚是内部沟通出了点问题。
Mr. Mao, the operator of the fined pharmacy, explained that he did not support the sale of the mask at a high price and that the penalty was an internal communication problem, the newspaper reported on Feb. 13.
“搞药店的人都知道，卖口罩是赚不了几个钱的，疫病期间，不能趁火打劫，不要说有通知，没有通知我也不让涨价。
"People in pharmacies know that selling masks doesn't make a lot of money. During epidemics, you can't take advantage of it, don't tell me, don't inform me and don't let prices go up.
”他表示，这次疫病，他还向红十字会捐了5万块钱，他经营的一家医院也腾出来给政府专门收治新冠肺炎病人。
He said he had also donated 50,000 yuan to the Red Cross for the disease and that a hospital he runs has been set aside for the government to treat patients suffering from pneumonia.
“我的觉悟不会那么低，主要是药店最近我交给我女婿管了，他不太了解情况，因为口罩的进价一直在涨，这次涨价也没有跟我说。
"My consciousness is not so low, mainly because I recently handed over to my son-in-law, he did not understand the situation, because the purchase price of masks has been rising, this time did not tell me.
”当记者问到，“卖口罩不挣钱，商家还有积极性吗?”毛先生表示，这个时候，企业要讲责任。
When asked by reporters, "Are businesses still motivated to sell masks if they don't make money?" Mr. Mao said, at this point, companies have to talk about responsibility.
报道还提到他没有去申请行政复议，也不想评价罚款是否有问题。
The report also mentioned that he did not apply for administrative review, and did not want to assess whether the fine is problematic.
