从钻石公主号开始，邮轮就被认为是疫情下的“魔鬼”，现在它想证明自己也可以是“天使”文|《财经》记者杨立赟编辑|余乐进入三月以来，新冠肺炎疫情在全球蔓延。
Since the beginning of the Princess Diamond, which has been known to be the "devil" of the epidemic, it now wants to prove it can also be Angel. Caijing's Yang Liyun, editor and editor of Caijing Yang Liyun, has spread globally since March.

自2月1日全球首个邮轮乘客被确诊为新冠肺炎后，邮轮便成为漂浮在海上的疫情炸弹，多艘邮轮无法靠岸，被称为“恐怖邮轮”，全球邮轮大范围停航。
Since the world's first cruise passenger was diagnosed with pneumonia on February 1, cruise ships have become floating bombs, unable to land, known as "terrorist cruise ships," and a wide range of global cruise ships have been grounded.
在业务停摆的情况下支援抗疫，或是邮轮公司扭转公众的负面印象、积攒商誉的办法。
Support the fight against the disease in the event of a business shutdown, or the way cruise companies can reverse negative public perceptions and build goodwill.
然而在改造成方舱医院时，邮轮如何保证通风系统等硬件符合收治病患的标准，仍是一个挑战。
However, it remains a challenge for cruise ships to ensure that hardware, such as ventilation systems, meets the standards required to treat patients when they are converted into a square-cabin hospital.

国际邮轮的船主、乘客、船员往往来自全球各地，为各国厘清责任主体带来挑战，考验着国际协作的能力和意愿。
The owners, passengers and crews of international cruise ships often come from all over the globe, posing challenges for States to identify responsible subjects and testing their ability and willingness to collaborate internationally.
面对着频频出现的“拒绝停靠”问题，各方态度不一。
In the face of frequent "no docking" problems, the parties have different attitudes.
美国旅行代理商协会（ASTA）CEO Zane Kerby批评港口拒绝邮轮靠岸。
Zane Kerby, CEO of the American Association of Travel Agents (ASTA), criticized the port for refusing to dock.
他在一份声明中说：“在过去的几周中，出现了令人不安的反人道主义趋势。

尽管地方政府有责任确保公民安全，但在危机时期，也还是要用人类尊严和常识去解决问题。
While local governments have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their citizens, human dignity and common sense are used to solve problems in times of crisis.
”“恐怖邮轮”变“海上方舱”与此同时，一些已经靠岸并清空客舱的邮轮，已经积极投入到了各国的抗疫事业之中。
Meanwhile, a number of cruise ships that had docked and emptied their cabins have been actively engaged in the fight against the disease in various countries.
“病毒温床”摇身一变成了“海上方舱”。
"Hotbed of the virus" into a "sea tank."
3月19日，GNV船务公司在意大利热那亚正式将一艘被改造为“海上方舱医院”的豪华客滚渡轮交付给意大利利古里亚大区，用于支持该地区的医疗系统抗击新冠病毒疫情。
On March 19, the GNV Shipping Company in Genoa, Italy, officially delivered a luxury passenger ferry converted into a "Maritime Square Hospital" to the region of Liguria to support the region's health-care system in the fight against the new crown virus.
GNV船务公司是MSC地中海航运集团的渡轮品牌，该集团总部位于瑞士日内瓦，旗下拥有全球第二大运输与物流企业地中海航运公司，最出名的是MSC地中海邮轮。
GNV Shipping is the ferry brand of the MSC Mediterranean Shipping Group, based in Geneva, Switzerland, which has the second-largest transport and logistics company in the world, most notably the MSC Mediterranean Cruise.
GNV船务公司在一个星期内改装了旗下的一艘名为“Splendid号”的豪华客滚渡轮，初步可提供25张病床。
The GNV Shipping Company converted within a week a luxury passenger ferry, the Splendid, with an initial capacity of 25 beds.
客舱均配备独立洗手间，并加装了完全独立的外循环通风系统，适合用于隔离。
The cabins are equipped with separate bathrooms and are fitted with a fully independent external circulation ventilation system suitable for isolation.
除客舱外，船上另有医护人员和船员专属的区域，可满足相关标准，兼顾舒适度与便利性。
In addition to the passenger cabin, the ship has medical staff and crew exclusive areas, can meet the relevant standards, balance comfort and convenience.
甲板上也配备了直升机停机坪。
Helipads have also been installed on deck.
据悉，这艘“海上方舱”将马上被启用并收治第一批的25名患者。
It is reported that the "sea cabin" will soon be opened and treatment of the first 25 patients.
之后也可以迅速继续改装客舱，增加至400张总床位。
The adaptation of the cabin to a total of 400 beds can also be continued rapidly thereafter.
MSC地中海航运集团象征性地收取了1欧元，直至利古里亚大区解除紧急状态。
The MSC Mediterranean Shipping Group received a symbolic Euro1 until the lifting of the state of emergency in the Liguria region.
同一天，全球最大的邮轮公司嘉年华（Carnival）公司宣布，其旗下的嘉年华游轮、荷兰美国专线、公主邮轮、P&O邮轮，将用作临时医院，帮助解决新冠肺炎疫情对全球医疗系统的影响。
On the same day, Carnival, the world's largest cruise company, announced that its Carnival cruise ship, Holland's US Line, Princess Cruise, P & amp; amp; P; and O Cruise will be used as a temporary hospital to help address the impact of the new Crown Pneumonia epidemic on the global health system.
嘉年华公司共运营105艘邮轮，拥有九大邮轮品牌，此次被用作医院的是其中的四个品牌。
Carnival operates 105 cruise ships with nine major brands, four of which were used as hospitals this time.
嘉年华公司表示，预计新冠肺炎的持续传播将对陆地上的医疗造成更大压力，可能会出现病床不足的情况，嘉年华公司呼吁政府和卫生当局考虑使用邮轮作为临时医疗设施，来收治病情不严重的非新冠肺炎患者，从而为陆地上的医院释放更多空间，提高陆地医院接收新冠肺炎患者的能力。
Carnival said it expected the continued spread of pneumonia would put more pressure on land-based care and could lead to a shortage of beds. Carnival called on the Government and health authorities to consider using cruise ships as temporary medical facilities to treat patients with mild non-Newly Crowded Pneumonia, freeing up more space for hospitals on land and increasing the capacity of land-based hospitals to receive patients with pneumonia.
与陆地上的医院相似，邮轮可以通过甲板被分割成不同的医疗区域。
Similar to hospitals on land, cruise ships can be divided into different medical areas on deck.
这些邮轮可以改造成总共1000个医院病房。
These vessels can be converted into a total of 1,000 hospital wards.
通过高速网络，邮轮病房可以快速安装远程监护设备，提供心脏、呼吸、血氧饱和度和视频监护功能。
Through a high-speed network, cruise wards can quickly install remote monitoring devices that provide heart, breathing, blood oxygen saturation and video surveillance functions.
邮轮病房还有浴室设施、私人阳台，能让病人接触到阳光和新鲜空气。
The cruise ward also has bathroom facilities and a private balcony that expose patients to the sun and fresh air.
如果需要，也有隔离功能。
Isolation is also available if required.
此外，这些邮轮可以提供七个重症监护病房（ICU），配备了心脏监护仪、呼吸机等医疗设备。
In addition, the vessels can provide seven intensive care units (ICUs) equipped with medical equipment such as cardiac monitors and respirators.
嘉年华公司称，邮轮医院将停泊在需要帮助的社区附近的码头，由船员来运营，以及所有生活方面的服务，包括食品和饮料以及清洁；医疗服务则由政府或医院提供。
According to Carnival, cruise hospitals will be berthed at wharves near communities in need of help, operated by crews, and all aspects of life, including food and drink and cleaning; medical services will be provided by the Government or hospitals.
值得注意的是，嘉年华公司邮轮改医院的善举并非完全免费，但也并不打算以此赢利。
It is worth noting that Carnival's philanthropic effort to convert the cruise ship into a hospital was not entirely free, but it was not intended to be profitable.
该公司声明，在费用方面，征用邮轮的相关部门仅需支付船只在港口运营时的基本费用。
The company stated that, in terms of costs, the relevant department of the requisitioning vessel would have to pay only the basic cost of the vessel's operation at the port.
由此，可厘清抗疫过程中各方所扮演的角色和相应承担的责任，不至于让企业承担超出能力范围的压力。
In this way, the roles and responsibilities of all parties in the fight against the epidemic can be clarified so as not to put pressure on enterprises beyond their capacity.
伸出援手的不仅邮轮公司，还有美国海军。
Not only cruise companies but also the U. S. Navy are helping out.
美国五角大楼证实，将派遣海军舒适号（Comfort）和仁慈号（Mercy）军舰，作为“漂浮医院”，支援纽约和其他地区的医疗系统。
The Pentagon has confirmed it will send naval vessels, Comfort and Mercy, as "floating hospitals" to support medical systems in New York and elsewhere.
这些军舰也是用来收治非新冠肺炎病患。
These ships are also used to treat patients with non-Newly Coronary Pneumonia.
在中国，一个月前有7艘邮轮投入抗疫工作。
In China, seven cruise ships entered the fight against the disease a month ago.
据长江网报道，截至2月23日，武汉紧急征用7艘客轮及1艘多功能污物接收船全部在武汉码头集结，可提供1469张床位，为援汉医疗队提供住宿接待服务。
As of February 23, Wuhan had urgently requisitioned seven passenger ships and one multi-purpose sewage receiving vessel, all of which were assembled at Wuhan docks, providing 1,469 beds to provide accommodation for the medical team, Changjiang reported.
这些船只配备了船员、服务人员近200名。
The ships were manned by nearly 200 crew and service personnel.
根据武汉防疫工作急需，全市设置了大量隔离点，征用了武汉市内大小酒店；而同时全国各地支援武汉的医疗队密集开进，也急需大量的酒店客房予以安置。
In response to the urgent need for epidemic prevention in Wuhan, a large number of quarantine points have been set up throughout the city, and hotels and large ones have been requisitioned.
为此，武汉方面紧急向交通运输部发函，恳请协助租用一批长江内河游轮支援，为援汉医疗队提供水上临时住所。
To this end, Wuhan has sent an urgent letter to the Ministry of Transport, asking for assistance in hiring a group of river cruise ships to support the rescue medical team to provide water temporary accommodation.
此外，邮轮上的病毒传播，与船上的通风系统不无关系。
In addition, the spread of the virus on a cruise ship is not unrelated to the ship's ventilation system.
如何适应“方舱医院”的卫生要求也成为人们关注的重点。
How to adapt to the sanitary requirements of "square cabin hospital" has also become the focus of people's attention.
江苏兆胜空调有限公司总经理助理陈香在接受界面新闻采访时表示，由于对空气净化没有需求，且需要付出额外成本，目前大型船舶上的空调和通风系统基本上都没有配备空气净化装置。
In an interview with Interface News, Chen Xiang, assistant general manager of Jiangsu Zhaoxing Air Conditioning Co. Ltd, said that air-conditioning and ventilation systems on large ships were currently largely unequipped with air purifiers because of the lack of demand for air purification and the additional costs involved.
陈香称，邮轮上的空调并不是只有一个中央系统，而是根据邮轮功能分出了很多区域，比如“中华复兴”号邮轮就有35个相互独立的空调区域，包括旅客活动区、船员生活区、功能区等，同时空调安装会依循外区和内区分开、左舷和右舷分开的原则。
Mr Chan said the air-conditioning system on the cruise ship did not have a single central system, but rather a number of areas based on cruise functions, such as the 35 separate air-conditioning areas of the China Renaissance, including passenger movement areas, crew living quarters, functional areas, etc., while the air-conditioning installation would follow the principle of separation of external and internal, port and starboard.
但是在同一个空调区域中，比如客舱内部相邻的两个客房，空气是可以经过空调循环后互相流动的。
But in the same air-conditioned area, such as the two rooms adjacent to the interior of the cabin, air can flow through the air-conditioning cycle.
因此，大型船舶的空调一旦安装好，改造起来非常麻烦，所以现有船舶不太容易对空调系统再做出改变。
Therefore, once the air conditioning of large ships is installed, it is very troublesome to retrofit, so it is not easy for existing ships to make further changes to the air-conditioning system.
截至发稿，地中海航运集团、嘉年华集团未回复《财经》杂志有关其如何改造“海上医院”通风系统的问询。
At the time of writing, MSC and Carnival had not responded to Caijing's enquiries about how it would revamp the ventilation system at the Sea Hospital.
不过，根据兆胜空调给邮轮客户提供的空调操作指南，通过给新风口消毒、增加新风量并关闭回风、关闭空调系统的加湿功能、利用排风机给特定空间创造出负压环境等方法，可减少交叉污染。
However, the air-conditioning operation guidelines provided to cruise customers under Mega-Shun air conditioners can reduce cross-contamination by disinfecting fresh air outlets, increasing fresh air volume and closing the return air, closing the humidifying function of the air-conditioning system and creating a negative pressure environment in a particular space using exhaust fans.
