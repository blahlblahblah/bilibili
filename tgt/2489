图片来源：视觉中国记者：陈鑫“ “如果抗体检测方法验证成功，也可以对轻症患者、隐性感染者、甚至是康复者进行普查，那我们就可以知道有多少人感染过新冠病毒。
"If the antibody test proves successful, we can also take a census of the mild cases, the recessive infection and even the convalescent, then we can know how many people have been infected with the new crown virus.
””两种准确率更高的新冠病毒检测试剂将于本周来到中国。
Two more accurate reagents for detecting the new crown virus are expected to arrive in China this week.
美国当地时间2月24日，被誉为“病毒猎手”的利普金教授在美国哥伦比亚大学接受了中国知名媒体人杨澜的专访时透露，本周至少二百份试剂将送到中国验证。
At least 200 reagents will be sent to China this week to be tested, Lipkin, who has been hailed as a "virus hunter," was interviewed by Yang Lan, a leading Chinese media official at Columbia University.
截止发稿，界面新闻联系利普金未获回复。
Deadline, interface news contact Lipkin did not receive a reply.
不过，中山大学公共卫生学院教授陆家海向界面新闻证实了这一消息。
But Lu Jiahai, a professor at Zhongshan University School of Public Health, confirmed the news.
据媒体报道，利普金教授团队通过特殊的荧光染色扩增PCR（聚合酶链式反应），使试剂灵敏度提高数倍。
According to media reports, Professor Lipkin's team amplified PCR (polymerase chain reaction) by special fluorescence staining, increasing the sensitivity of the reagent several times.
另外，该团队还使用了世界上独一无二的血清芯片，用来确定最具特异性的肽段来做ELISA（酶联免疫吸附试验），不仅准确便宜有效，操作还方便。
In addition, the team used a unique serum chip from around the world to identify the most specific peptide segments for ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorption assay), which is accurate, inexpensive, and easy to operate.
这两种技术都有助于诊断提高灵敏度和准确度。
Both techniques are useful in diagnosing and improving sensitivity and accuracy.
“（利普金团队的技术人员）这两天就到了，我现在正在跟他们联系，两种方法都会带过来。
"[The Lipkin team technicians] are here these two days, and I'm in touch with them right now, and I'll bring them both.
”陆家海说。
"said Lu.
陆家海指出，检测多种‌‌未知病原的抗体‌‌的方法是重要的，“我们正在联系能够读取血清抗体芯片信息的高分辨率芯片扫描仪，只要仪器到位，‌‌验证过程只需要几天，‌‌之后就能够快速生产大量的试剂。
Lujiahai points out that it is important to detect a variety of antibody-to-quotient anti-quotient quotient quotient. "We are contacting high-resolution chip scanners that can read seroantibody chip information, so long as the instrument is in place, it takes only a few days to perform the validation process.
”利普金是美国哥伦比亚大学公共卫生学院感染与免疫中心主任、传染病学专家，也被称为国际流行病学领域的“病毒猎手”。
Lipkin, director of the Infection and Immunity Center at Columbia University's School of Public Health and an infectious diseases specialist, is also known as the "virus hunter" in international epidemiology.
作为世界上第一个使用分子手段诊断病原菌的科学家，利普金曾在2003年应邀来华抗击SARS，为中国培训了大批会使用该项技术的医务人员。
Lipkin, the world's first scientist to use molecular diagnostic tools to diagnose pathogens, was invited to China in 2003 to fight SARS, training a large number of medical personnel to use the technology.
2020年1月底，利普金应中国卫生部门的邀请，帮助评估COVID-19带来的风险、支援新冠病毒检测和防控研究，并与国家卫健委高级别专家组的钟南山、曾光等人会面，期间由陆家海全程陪同。
At the end of January 2020, Lipkin was invited by the Chinese health authorities to help assess the risks posed by COVID-19, support research on new crown virus detection and prevention and control, and meet with Zhong Nan Shan and Zeng Guang of the National Health Commission's high-level panel of experts, accompanied by Lujiahai throughout.
目前，利普金已经返回美国，并刚结束两周的自我隔离期。
Lipkin has now returned to the United States, ending a two-week period of self-imposed isolation.
其团队正与中国合作研究新冠病毒的检测技术，同时更深入了解病毒的传播和发展路径。
The team is working with China to develop new crown virus detection technologies and to better understand how the virus spreads and develops.
日前，中国多位专家也指出，确认疫情“拐点”的基础，检测试剂的精确性则是摸清“底数”的关键。
Recently, a number of Chinese experts also pointed out that the "inflection point" of the epidemic, the accuracy of detection reagents is the key to the understanding of the "bottom."
利普金接受媒体采访时也提到，因为疫苗研发耗时长，所以目前如何准确诊断、控制疫情传播仍是关键。
Lipkin told the media, because the vaccine development time-consuming, so how to accurately diagnose and control the spread of the epidemic is still the key.
针对许多被隔离的感染者新冠病毒PCR核酸检测呈“假阴性”的问题，陆家海介绍，利普金团队正在研发一种多重检测工具，能够检测出新冠病毒以外的其它可能存在的病原体。
Lipkin's team is developing a multiple detection tool to detect possible pathogens other than the new crown virus, according to Lu Jiahai, who tested negative for PCR nucleic acid in many isolated infected people.
“现有的检测试剂能排除‌‌新型冠状病毒，而不能够鉴别诊断感染究竟是由于新型冠状病毒造成，还是其他呼吸道常见病毒导致。
"The present detection reagent can exclude the new coronavirus from the needle and can not distinguish whether the diagnosis is caused by the new coronavirus or by other common respiratory viruses.
”陆家海说。
"said Lu.
中国工程院院士钟南山2月23日在广州医科大学附属第一医院与广东对口支援湖北荆州医疗队进行远程会诊时曾表示，当前中国处于流感高发季节，通过快速检测，把新冠肺炎患者和流感患者区分开来是当务之急。
Speaking at a tele-consultation with Guangdong counterparts in support of the Hubei Jingzhou Medical Team on Feb. 23, Zhong Nan Shan, an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that rapid testing to separate patients with new crown pneumonia from those suffering from influenza was an urgent task.
“利普金团队正在做抗体检测的研究。
"Lipkin's team is working on an antibody test.
‌‌如果能够引入抗体检测方法，不仅能鉴别新冠病毒，也能同时知晓患者在新冠的感染过程中是否有其他的感染。
If the patient can introduce antibody detection method, not only can identify the new crown virus, but also know whether the patient has other infections in the new crown.
”陆家海强调，这对于解释重症患者是否有多重感染或者以往感染，‌‌以及重症患者的致病机制有很重要的作用。
Lu stressed that this is important in explaining whether patients with severe illnesses have multiple or previous infections, and in the onset of disease and the pathogenesis of severe disease.
“如果抗体检测方法验证成功，也可以对轻症患者、隐性感染者、甚至是康复者进行普查，那我们就可以知道有多少人感染过新冠病毒。
"If the antibody test proves successful, we can also take a census of people with mild, hidden, or even recovering patients, and we can know how many people have been infected with the new crown virus.
”陆家海说。
"said Lu.
利普金也表示，因为目前还没有摸清新冠感染者的底数，有些人感染了新冠但没有任何症状，抗体检测就能检出这些无症状感染者。
Lipkin also said antibody tests can detect asymptomatic infections in people who have a new crown but do not have any symptoms, because the bottom number of new infections is not known.
而在国内，能够进行鉴别诊断和抗体检测的试剂已经获批。
In China, the reagents that can be used for differential diagnosis and antibody detection have been approved.
2月22日，国家药监局应急审批通过3家企业3个新型冠状病毒检测产品，其中一个是关于如何鉴别流感、新冠肺炎和副流感的试剂，另外还批准两个比较合格的抗体试剂盒。
On February 22, the State Administration of Pharmaceutical Supervision and Administration approved three new coronavirus test products from three enterprises, including one on how to identify reagents for influenza, new crown pneumonia and parainfluenza, and approved two more qualified antibody kits.
“两种试剂盒都是采用的胶体金法，能够测出患者体内的lgM抗体，在患者感染的第7天或发病的第3天就能够检测出lgM抗体，对患者进一步的确诊很有帮助。
"Both kits are colloidal gold, which measures the lgM antibody in the patient and detects it on the seventh day of infection or the third day of onset, which is helpful for further diagnosis.
”钟南山称。
