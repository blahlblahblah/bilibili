口罩产业，中国的优势在低成本和产能，但口罩产业的金字塔尖依然被3M、霍尼韦尔、尤妮佳等公司占据，这背后是一套制造强国的工业哲学陈琛林雪萍 | 文随着疫情扩展到全国，各大药房、网店口罩纷纷售罄，补货更是遥遥无期，世界各国产能已经被预定至数月之后。
While China's strength in the mask industry lies in its low cost and capacity, the pyramid of the mask industry is still dominated by 3M, Honeywell and Yuniga. Behind the epidemic is Chen Xueping, an industrial philosophy of manufacturing powerhouses.
短缺蔓延到全球，日本、韩国、美国、欧洲甚至印度的商店里都是一罩难求。
The shortages spread around the world, with stores in Japan, South Korea, the United States, Europe, and even India.
世界卫生组织2月6日发布报告，中国口罩的需求量上升了100倍，价格上升了20倍。
China's demand for masks has risen 100-fold and prices have risen 20-fold, the World Health Organization reported on February 6.
很难想象，具有世界上最完整工业体系的中国竟然在小小的口罩上犯了难。
It is hard to imagine that China, with the world's most integrated industrial system, has stumbled over a small mask.
远在日本和欧洲的供应商也感受到市场的热浪，日本官房长官菅义伟在2月1日的记者会上表示，在日本国内口罩业者采取24 小时生产体制的努力下，日本每周的口罩供应量可望达到1亿片以上。
Suppliers as far afield as Japan and Europe are feeling the heat, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kan told a news conference on Feb. 1 that Japan is expected to supply more than 100 million masks a week thanks to a 24-hour production system by Japanese mask makers.
路透社1月底报道，捷克企业接到的订单暴增570倍，另据《纽约时报》报道，法国昂热的一家企业在一周之内接到了10亿订单，而去年全年的产量才是1.7亿只。
A company in Ange, France, received a billion orders in a week, compared with 170 million for the whole of last year, the New York Times reported at the end of January.
口罩为什么不能很快上市口罩是超大规模、廉价制造、模块化的装配型产品。
Why Masks Can't Be Listed Soon The Mask is an ultra-large, inexpensive, modular assembly-type product.
首先是规模。
The first is scale.
中国产量占据世界的50%。
China accounts for 50 per cent of world production.
每天生产口罩一千多万只，2019年生产50亿只，居世界第一。
It produces more than 10 million masks a day and 5 billion in 2019, the highest in the world.
其次是廉价制造，每个口罩可能才赚几厘钱，盈利靠海量出货，涓滴汇成小溪流。
The second is cheap manufacturing, each mask may only earn a few centimeters, profit by large shipments, trickle down into a stream.
河南长垣两家医疗器械公司董事长证实，医用普通口罩出厂价每个9分钱左右，医用外科口罩每个在4毛到4毛5分之间。
The chairman of two medical-device companies in Changyuan, Henan, confirmed that the factory price of common medical masks is around 9 cents each, and that medical surgical masks range from 40 cents to 45 cents each.
江苏省江阴某口罩工厂曾对外表示，工厂一年给日本代工口罩3亿只，每只出厂价两分钱，每只赚不到五厘钱。
A mask factory in Jiangyin, Jiangsu province, once said that the factory gives 300 million face masks to Japan a year.
最后口罩是模块化的装配产品。
The last mask is a modular assembly product.
普通的医用口罩是由聚丙烯纤维无纺布层，熔喷布层，耳带线，鼻梁金属条等部件组装而成，根据不同的种类还需添加过滤棉层和活性炭层。
Common medical masks are made of polypropylene fiber non-woven layer, molten cloth layer, ear band line, nose girder metal strip and so on. Filtrated cotton layer and activated carbon layer need to be added according to different kinds.
而中国的口罩工厂并不拥有完整的产业链条，只是将这些零件组装起来的地方。
And China's mask factory does not have a complete industrial chain, only the parts put together in the place.
假设这些原材料供给足够充足，新扩产的口罩工厂也很难很快就将口罩输送到市场。
Assuming the supply of these raw materials is sufficient, it will be difficult for newly expanded mask factories to bring them to market soon.
去除设备到货、设备调试时间，只看口罩从零件到包装成箱，首先是口罩的装配，目前通过压合、裁切、贴条、焊带等流程就可以生产出一枚口罩，全套自动化生产线每用不了1秒可以生产一个口罩。
Remove equipment arrival, equipment commissioning time, only see mask from parts to packaging into a box, first of all mask assembly, through the pressure, cutting, paste, welding procedures can be produced a mask, a complete automated production line can produce a mask in less than a second.
但耗时的是消毒过程，这是新投产的口罩生产线不能很快上市的一个重要因素，每个口罩需要在环氧乙烷溶液中消毒，由于环氧乙烷属于有毒物质，消毒过后的口罩需要静置解析至少7天，待环氧乙烷全部分解掉后，才能包装上市。
But time-consuming is the sterilization process, which is an important factor in the failure of the new production line to be marketed soon. Each mask needs to be sterilized in ethylene oxide solution. Because ethylene oxide is a toxic substance, the sterilized mask should be left in a static position for at least 7 days until the ethylene oxide has been dissolved.
若采用辐照灭菌技术，可将这一过程缩短至24小时。
This process can be reduced to 24 hours if irradiation is used.
口罩背后的复杂产业链口罩虽是几毛钱的产品，但同样拥有复杂精巧的产业链。
The complex industrial chain mask behind the mask is a few cents' worth of products, but it also has a complex and sophisticated industrial chain.
和其他产业相比，国内产值仅为一百多亿的口罩价值链犹如一条细长蜿蜒的小河，和多条大江大河连通，比如化工、纺织、机械、电子。
With a value of just over $10 billion worth of masks compared to other industries, the value chain is like a slender, winding river, connected to rivers like chemicals, textiles, machinery and electronics.
原材料方面，聚丙烯被加工成喷熔无纺布，再运送到口罩厂商，经过裁剪缝制成为口罩，包装之后再经过消毒灭菌，之后要通过解析，最后才能转变成可以在市场上流通的产品。
Raw materials, polypropylene is processed into spray-fusible non-woven cloth, and then shipped to the mask manufacturer, after tailoring into a mask, packaging and then sterilized and sterilized, then through analysis before finally being transformed into a marketable product.
设备方面，涉及到一大批机械加工零部件、气动元件、电气零部件，又通往了另一个繁杂无比的世界。
Equipment, involving a large number of machining parts, pneumatic components, electrical components, and access to another complex world.
口罩用的聚丙乙烯可能来自于浙江的镇海炼化，这些原料在山东被加工成中间产品熔喷无纺布，中间产品再运输到河南，当地及全国其他地方再引进鼻梁条、挂耳绳、粘合剂，最终制成口罩，小小的一个口罩，其实是标准的模块化组合式产品。
The polypropylene used in the mask may have come from Zhenhai refinery in Zhejiang Province, where the raw materials were processed into intermediate products such as melt-sprayed nonwoven fabric. Intermediate products were reshipped to Henan province, where nosebeams, ear ropes, adhesives and eventually masks were eventually made into a standard modular composite product.
河南的设备也有可能来自东莞，东莞的口罩机设备涉及到材料加工、电气控制、气动元件，很有可能还要从长三角或珠三角某地购买超声波压焊设备，从上海购买自动包装设备，还要从其他地方引入相关的消毒设备和原料。
The equipment in Dongguan is related to the processing of materials, electrical control, pneumatic components, and it is likely that ultrasonic welding equipment will be purchased from somewhere in the Yangtze River Delta or the Pearl River Delta, automatic packaging equipment from Shanghai, and related disinfection equipment and raw materials from elsewhere.
小小的一个口罩，在牵动无数人神经的同时，也牵动了数十条大大小小的产业链。
A small mask, while touching the nerves of countless people, but also affected dozens of large and small industrial chains.
长垣生产的口罩，其实是全球供应链集成融合出来的产物，其中涉及到的资产可能达到数十万亿，即使是福布斯排行榜上的首富也负担不起。
Fallen masks are the product of a global supply chain integration that can involve hundreds of billions of dollars in assets that even the richest man on the Forbes list cannot afford.
扎进口罩世界还会发现，即使是大企业来做口罩，也很难一蹴而就，设备的研发、制造、安装、调试和改进，原材料的引进，无尘生产车间的建设，物料的对接和配送，工人的培训，非常时期，雄壮的大企业也得把此前市场上一件又一件琐碎的小事情扛在身上，也只有汽车、化工和电子行业的巨头才能在关键时期跨越大江大河。
The world will find that even large enterprises to make masks, equipment research and development, manufacturing, installation, debugging and improvement, raw materials introduction, construction of dust-free production workshops, docking and distribution of materials, training of workers, very difficult times, only big enterprises in the automotive, chemical and electronics industries can cross the big rivers in critical periods.
口罩背后的制造大国与强国从中国制造口罩的能力来看，中国是制造强国吗？很遗憾，小小口罩，同样隔开了大国和强国。
Is China a manufacturing powerhouse in terms of its ability to make masks in China? Unfortunately, small masks also separate the big and powerful.
如何理解一个制造强国？发动机能否造出来固然是一个标志，小小口罩能不能造好也是一个重要指标。
How to understand a manufacturing power? Whether the engine can be made is a sign, whether a small mask can be built is also an important indicator.
天下口罩，谁是大牛？世界级品牌，是来自美国的3M和霍尼韦尔，还有日本最大口罩制造商尤妮佳。
World-class brands are 3M and Honeywell from the United States, as well as the biggest mask maker in Japan.
这些国外品牌的价格，往往是国内的价格的10倍以上。
The prices of these foreign brands are often more than 10 times higher than domestic prices.
2019年中国口罩十大品牌 来源：观研天下这些公司都是什么样的公司呢？霍尼韦尔，工业巨头，2018财年收入420亿美元，利润近70亿美元；3M，工业巨头，2019 年净收入超过 300 亿美元，净利润约 46 亿美元；尤妮佳，日用消费品领头羊，2019财年收入66亿美元，利润近6亿美元。
Honeywell, the industrial giant, has revenues of $42 billion in FY2018 and profits of nearly $7 billion; 3M, the industrial giant, with a net income of more than $30 billion in 2019, with a net profit of about $4.6 billion; and Yunja, the leader in consumer products, with revenues of $6.6 billion and a profit of nearly $600 million in 2019.
这些大品牌为什么要去做小小的口罩？口罩在中国只是一个上百亿的市场。
Why do these big brands make tiny masks? Masks are a billion-dollar market in China.
看上去还不够群雄塞牙缝，那么国外品牌如何生存？这些企业无一不是多元化的代表，但是做口罩却各有各的招法。
How do foreign brands survive if they don't seem to be clawing their teeth? Not all of them are representative of diversity, but making masks has its own tactics.
以“尤妮佳”为例，它曾两次入选福布斯发布的 “全球100家最具创新力公司”榜单。
For example, Eunice has been named twice on Forbes' list of the world's 100 most innovative companies.
它最大的能力是来自强大的情报收集能力，和对用户个性化需求的把握。
Its greatest strength comes from a strong intelligence-gathering capacity and a grasp of the individual needs of its users.
如口罩而言，尤妮佳也开发了给女士的小脸口罩。
In the case of masks, Yunja has also developed a small face mask for women.
并且凭借无纺布吸收材料为轴心，多面拓展，成为生活护理领域的超级巨头。
And with the help of non-woven absorbent material as the axis, multi-sided expansion, become the field of life care super giant.
尤妮佳在一些看似传统的产品中玩出了花样。
Eunice is playing with something that seems to be traditional.
霍尼韦尔的优势，则体现在对工厂环境和安全防护有充分的认识，而3M则是材料的巨人。
Honeywell's advantage lies in his understanding of the factory environment and safety precautions, while 3M is the giant of materials.
小口罩当然无法撑起3M、霍尼韦尔、尤妮佳的生存空间，但是他们多元化产品的结网效应明显。
The mask certainly won't support 3M, Honeywell, or Eunice, but their multiple products have a strong networking effect.
口罩背后是材料的竞争，也是装备的竞争。
Behind the mask is material competition, but also equipment competition.
口罩不过是技术土壤里长出的一棵大树，是系统性解决方案的一个分支。
A mask is just a tree growing in the soil of technology, a branch of a systemic solution.
这就是制造强国的特点，它不是以单项产业的规模取胜，而以底层技术向各领域渗透而取胜。
This is the characteristic of manufacturing powerhouses, which win not by the size of individual industries, but by the penetration of low-level technologies in all fields.
看似无序的多元化产品，却是靠技术将其从内涵中串织起来，编制出来一个难以复制的有机体。
What appears to be a disorderly, diversified product is woven by technology from its connotations to create an organism that is difficult to replicate.
利用标准确定行业领导地位，则是另外一种诀窍。
Using standards to determine industry leadership is another trick.
比如疫情中大家最喜欢的N95口罩，就是美国标准， N95口罩是指符合美国国家职业安全卫生研究所规定的空气过滤“N95”评级的、可阻挡95%直径0.3微米以上的非油性颗粒的口罩，其他国家的标准也很大程度上参考了美国标准。
For example, the most popular N95 mask in the epidemic is the United States standard. N95 mask is a non-oily mask with a 95% diameter diameter of 0.3 micron or more that meets the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's air filter rating of "N95," and standards in other countries draw heavily on United States standards.
但是要确定这个标准，需要严格的测试流程，专业的测试仪器，比如说美国的TSI公司气溶胶检测仪器，如果没有仪器和手段，那想确定标准也无从说起。
But setting this standard requires rigorous testing procedures and specialized test instruments, such as TSI's Aerosol Detection Instruments in the United States, and without instruments and tools, it is impossible to establish standards.
中国大把的钱，都被这些标准检测机构给拿走了。
Huge sums of money in China have been taken away by these standard testing agencies.
口罩产业，中国的优势在于低成本和产能，但口罩产业的金字塔尖依然被制造业强国掌握，这背后是一套制造强国的工业哲学。
China's strength in the mask industry lies in its low cost and capacity, but the pyramid of the mask industry is still dominated by manufacturing powerhouses, behind an industrial philosophy of manufacturing powerhouses.
