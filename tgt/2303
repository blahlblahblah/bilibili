2月14日晚上十一点多，高师傅和其他五位护工终于不再无“家”可归。
February 14 more than 11: 00 p.m., master Gao and five other care workers finally no longer have "home" to go home.
曾经的“家”是在医院，他们所照顾的病人病床旁的折叠床上。
Once the "home" was in the hospital, where they cared for the patients next to the beds on the folding bed.
作为武汉中心医院南京路院区的一名护工，高师傅一天24小时都在医院。
As a nurse at Nanjing Road Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, Gao Shifu is in hospital 24 hours a day.
春节那三天会有三倍工资，所以很多人像高师傅一样放弃了回家的机会，选择留下来陪护病人，“这是百年不遇的事情，谁知道会有这个事情呢（疫情）？”正月十五，因为同病房的一位病人确诊为新冠肺炎，整层楼的病护都进行了隔离，连高师傅所陪护的老人也一并确诊，这时，她已经来不及想太多，因为医院开始给护工下达离院通知，让他们尽快离开。
Many people, like Gao Shifu, gave up the chance to go home and stay with their patients. "It was a rare event in a hundred years. Who knew it would happen?" On the 15th of January, when a patient in the same ward was diagnosed with pneumonia, the whole building was quarantined.
离开之后去哪里？医院没说，他们也不知道。
Where to go after leaving? Hospital did not say, they do not know.
2月13日，同一家医院里另一位护工吕师傅也做了肺部CT检查，报告显示肺部有异常，但还未确诊。
On 13 February, another nurse at the same hospital, Master Lu, also underwent a pulmonary CT examination, which revealed an abnormal but undiagnosed lung condition.
那晚62岁的她靠着医院外墙过了一夜，楼下还站有不少仍在徘徊的护工，他们有些或已经出现了被感染的症状，有些暂时无恙，但是困惑仍然是一致的，有护工说道：“我在医院做了十几年护工，天天就住在病人旁边，现在也没办法种田，离开了医院我没有地方去。
She spent the night leaning against the outside of the hospital at age 62, and there were many nurses downstairs who were either infected or temporarily unhurt, but the confusion was still the same, said the nurse. I worked in a hospital for more than a decade, lived with patients every day, and now I have no place to farm
”“就算是居家隔离，也没有家”师傅，是护工之间互相称呼彼此的习惯用法，不分男女。
"Even in a home setting, there is no home," said the master, an idiom used by caregivers to refer to each other, men and women alike.
高师傅是湖北孝感人，住在汉川的刁东农场，那里有着大片大片的棉花基地，在服装厂、泡沫厂都做过以后，她觉得每个月两千多块的工资还是太少。
Gao Shifu is Hubei filial piety, living in Han Chuan Diao Dong Farm, where there are large swathes of cotton base, after the garment factories, foam factories have done, she felt that more than two thousand dollars a month is still too small.
2016年，高师傅跟家里一个嫂嫂来到武汉，经家政中介介绍到武汉市中心医院给一位退休治疗的老干部当了护工。
In 2016, Gao and a sister-in-law came to Wuhan and were referred to Wuhan Central Hospital by a domestic intermediary to work as a caretaker for a retired veteran cadre.
以前一天12小时的上班时间对她来说太少了，挣不够钱，“在医院能做24个小时，工资比汉川高一些。
The previous day's 12-hour shift was too little for her to earn, "24 hours in a hospital and a higher salary than in Hanchuan."
”去年一年，高师傅只回家了两次，一次因为有老人去世待了九天，另一次只待了两天。
Last year, Shifu Gao only went home twice, once for nine days after an old man died and once for two days.
“腊月二十几号的时候看很多人在上边说华南海鲜市场有了什么病，当时没有当回事。
"When I was in my twenties, I saw a lot of people saying that there was something wrong with the seafood market in South China.
”过了几天，护士长跟她们说不要出去，不要到处串病房。
After a few days the matron told them not to go out and go around the room.
初三初四的时候，自己认识的两个护工发烧，去检查以后发现被感染了。
On the fourth day of junior high school, the two nurses I knew had a fever and went to check and found to be infected.
高师傅也开始怕了。
Master Gao began to be afraid.
当时经常进出病房的一位家属开始头晕，“我给她发微信说你赶紧去检查啊，现在蛮多人病了。
One of the family members who used to go in and out of the ward began to feel dizzy. "I sent her a letter saying you had to check it out quickly.
”朱清清是高师傅照顾的老人的女儿，她回忆说过年后病房里已经有老人持续在发烧，核酸检测做完结果不好，转移马上就开始了。
Zhu Qingqing, the daughter of an elderly man taken care of by Gao, recalled how elderly people in the ward had been feverish since the Chinese New Year and that DNA testing had ended badly.
转到隔离病区后，医院安排病人陆续接受了CT检测和核酸检测。
After the transfer to the isolation ward, the hospital arranged for CT and nucleic acid tests.
高师傅担心自己也被感染，就和朱清清沟通给自己也做一次。
Gao Shifu worried that he too was infected, so he communicated with Zhu Qingqing to himself.
CT结果显示高师傅肺部有一些阴影，可能与之前得过肺结核有关，并没有做新冠肺炎方面的诊断。
CT findings suggest that GaoShifu has some shadow in his lungs, possibly linked to previous cases of tuberculosis, and has not been diagnosed with New Crown Pneumonia.
第二天朱清清给高师傅送来一些药，让高师傅做预防。
The next day Zhu Qingqing sent some medicine to Master Gao to take precautions.
病人家属给高师傅买的药当时武汉已经封城数天，高师傅说要是以前还能让儿子来接她回家，现在也回不了家，离开医院也是流落街头，没有去处。
The medicine that the patient's family bought for Gao had been sealed in Wuhan for days, and Master Gao said that if he had been able to bring her home, he would not be able to return home.
另一边，朱清清的母亲已经92岁，去年生了一场大病以后处于完全失能状态，身边离不开人照顾。
On the other hand, Zhu Qingqing's mother, 92, was totally incapacitated after a serious illness last year and cannot be cared for.
跟家人商量后，高师傅决定留在隔离病区继续照顾老人。
After consulting his family, Master Gao decided to stay in the quarantine area and continue to look after the elderly.
此时医院已经开始要求隔离病区的护工离开。
By this time the hospital had begun to ask the nurses in the quarantined area to leave.
而高师傅照顾的老人核酸检测结果也出来了，显示阳性。
But Gao Shifu took care of the elderly nucleic acid test results also came out, showing a positive.
但这依然没有动摇她要继续留在医院的想法：“照顾老人还有地方住啊。
But it did not sway her from the idea of staying in the hospital: "There's room for old people.
之前有一个护士长来通知我们去发热门诊打针，我说我们也不发烧，人家怎么会收我们看这个病？有的护工下去几天了，都不发烧，没办法给你治，没吃没喝的，都在大厅里坐着。
Before a head nurse came to tell us to go to the fever clinic to injection, I said we do not have a fever, how can people take us to see this disease? Some care workers for a few days, do not have a fever, there is no way to treat you, did not eat and drink, are sitting in the hall.
”她担心下去后就再也回不来了。
She was afraid that she would never go home again.
对于目前的处境，吕师傅只是无奈，“我们也不懂啊，现在也没人管你。
As for the current situation, Master Lu is just helpless, "we do not understand ah, now no one cares about you.
家里人也没有办法，他们也来不了”，“想着得了（新冠肺炎）就这样吧”，有药吃就行。
There was nothing the family could do, and they could not come either. "" Think of it that way, "just take the medicine.
“因为护工的意愿在那里，现在在医院也是一个隔离的状态，你把她赶出去，她怎么办呢？她们属于密切接触感染者，就算是居家隔离，也没有家啊。
'Because the nurse's wishes are there, and now in the hospital in isolation, what will she do if you drive her out? They are in close contact with the infected, even if they are isolated at home.
”高师傅已经护理朱清清的母亲三年，“他们家姑娘蛮好啊，对我蛮好，像亲姐姐一样”。
Master Gao had nursed Zhu Qingqing's mother for three years. "Their girl is very nice to me, just like her sister."
朱清清和身在外地的儿子一起，开始帮助高师傅和其他五位护工争取找到落脚的地方。
Along with his son, Zhu Qingqing began to help Gao and five other nurses to find a place to stay.
疫情下的流动人口朱清清和护工口中所经常提到的“陪护中心”，其实是一家政中介。
The floating population under the epidemic, Zhu Qingqing and the nurse often mentioned in the mouth of the "escort center," is in fact a domestic intermediary.
中介的作用是为护工和病人家属之间搭建联系，签署一份协议后，他们就会从中收取家属的中介费和护工的管理费。
The intermediary's role is to establish a link between the caregiver and the patient's family and, upon signing an agreement, they collect the intermediary fee from the family and the carer's management fee.
“我们介绍他们（护工）上岗。
"We introduced them [as caregivers].
”而经由家政中心介绍上岗的护工们与家政中心并没有劳动合同。
Nursing workers referred to home management centers do not have work contracts with them.
所以，尽管护工由中介“派出”，又长期扎根在医院里，但他们其实不属于任何一方，在疫情这样的节点，成为了漂泊无依的人。
So, while caregivers are "dispatched" by intermediaries and have long-established roots in hospitals, they do not really belong to either side, in a node like the epidemic, become drifting people.
负责人说，他在知道了护工被要求离开医院的情况后，已经和家属一起协助他们做了CT检查，并且跟社区、街道和相关部门打电话，“打了很多”，“社区说这些护工不在他们的辖区内，没办法登记”，一开始，街道称要确诊核酸阳性才给登记，但是后来考虑到他们都没有住址，并且看到了CT报告结果，就都登记上了。
The director said he had worked with his family after learning that the nurses had been asked to leave the hospital and called the community, street and related authorities, saying "a lot of times," "the community said the nurses were not in their district and could not be registered."
如今在武汉，在街道进行了登记才有了确诊和进一步治疗的可能。
Now in Wuhan, the streets have been registered before the diagnosis and further treatment of the possibility.
一元街道的负责人告诉记者，武汉市中心医院南京路院区确实在他们的辖区范围内，但是护工的数量很多，而且护工既不在辖区住，户口也不在社区，属于流动人口。
The head of Yiyuan Street told reporters that the Nanjing Road courtyard area of Wuhan Central Hospital was indeed within their jurisdiction, but the number of care workers was high, and the care workers were neither resident in the jurisdiction nor in the community, belonging to the floating population.
社区的居民数量很多，而街道的床位和医疗资源也十分紧张。
The community has a large number of inhabitants and street beds and medical resources are severely strained.
“所以之前跟医院联系看能不能通过医院，让生病的得到治疗。
"So contact the hospital before to see if you can go through the hospital and let the sick get treatment.
社区的居民很多，如果是送到社区，等的时间会比较长。
Communities have large numbers of inhabitants and wait longer if they are sent to the community.
但是医院说护工也不是他们聘请的，医院的资源也很紧张。
But the hospital says the nurses were not hired, and its resources were strained.
”目前，一元街道只能先将六位护工的资料登记在社区，按照社区的分类标准向上申报。
At present, only six caretakers can be registered in the community on a one-dollar street and declared upward according to the community classification criteria.
记者此前曾向武汉市中心医院南京路院区询问情况，院方称目前医院已被征收，对于护工问题需要了解一下才能答复，截至发稿未得到医院方回复。
The reporter had asked the central hospital of Wuhan Nanjing Road district, the hospital said that the hospital has been collected, the care workers need to know to answer the question, as of the draft did not receive hospital response.
情人节当天，高师傅收到一位记者发来的微信，让他们带好身份证件和行李到江岸区胜利街的城市快捷酒店先住下来。
On Valentine's Day, Master Gao received a message from a reporter asking them to bring their identification papers and luggage to stay at the City Express in Shengjie Street, Jiangxi Province.
“尤其是被子，酒店有房间，但没有被子。
"Especially quilts. The hotel has rooms but no quilts.
”终于在这天结束之前，六个人找到了暂时的落脚点。
"At last, before the day was over, the six men found a temporary foothold.
他们住进的是一个临时观察点，并不配备医护人员。
They were admitted to a temporary observation point and were not staffed with medical personnel.
志愿者团队得知这一情况，给护工们提供了线上买药链接，但是线上买药对于年岁已高的护工们来说并非易事。
The volunteer team learned about this and provided online drug-buying links for caregivers, but buying drugs online is no easy task for older carers.
并且，很多药物需要遵医嘱服用，那些只拿到CT检测结果，因为长期缺乏社会经验而操着一口方言的护工们，很难和医生详细沟通，听取他们线上的意见。
Moreover, many medications are prescribed by doctors, and care workers who only get CT results because they speak a dialect because of their chronic lack of social experience find it difficult to communicate fully with doctors and listen to their online opinions.
这些，成为了下一步的难题。
These are the next challenges.
除了已经被通知离开的高师傅们，其实还有一些坚守在医院非隔离区的护工们。
In addition to the GaoShifu who have been notified to leave, there are a number of nurses who stay in the hospital's non-quarantine area.
李师傅就是一位还在非隔离区护理病人的护工，李师傅说除了几位病人已经退院的护工离开了，自己和同楼层的其他护工仍然在照顾病人。
Li, a nurse who is still nursing patients outside the quarantine zone, said he and other nursing staff on the same floor were taking care of patients, except for a few who had already checked out.
“我们目前还是安全的，医院没说让我们走。
"We're safe now. The hospital didn't say let's go.
”但她要是到了不得不离开医院的一天，也许会面临着相似的处境。
But if she got to the day she had to leave the hospital, she might face a similar situation.
早日获得治疗，或者能去到方舱医院，成为受感染的护工们的希望。
Early access to treatment, or access to cabin hospitals, is the hope of infected caregivers.
