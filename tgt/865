希望大家在关注武汉之余能把目光和关怀投向同样危急的黄冈接受采访的时候，孙亮哭了。
I hope you can pay attention to Wuhan after the eyes and concern to the same critical Huanggang interview, Sun Liang cried.
不到半个月的时间，父母相续感染上新冠肺炎，如今父亲去世、母亲至今仍在ICU。
Less than half a month later, parents continued to contract pneumonia, and now his father is dead and his mother is still in ICU.
他之所以接受采访，是因为想把真实的情况告知更多的人，希望大家在关注武汉之余，能把目光和关怀投向同样危急的黄冈。
He was interviewed because he wanted to tell the truth to more people, hope you can pay attention to Wuhan, but also eyes and concern to the same critical Huanggang.
孙亮向《中国新闻周刊》讲述完自己的故事之后的两天，2月1日，黄冈市发布《关于加强市区人员出行管控工作的紧急通知》，通知决定即日起，在黄冈市区范围内实行居民出行管控措施。
"On February 1, two days after Sun Liang told China News Weekly of his story, the city of Huanggang issued an" Emergency Notice on Strengthening the Control of the Travel of People in Urban Areas, "announcing the decision to implement measures to control residents' travel within the city limits.
严格控制市区居民出行，每户家庭每两天可指派1人上街采购生活物资，其他人员除生病就医、疫情防控工作需要、在商超和药店上班外，不得外出。
Strict control of the movement of urban residents, each family every two days can assign one person to the street to purchase living materials, other personnel in addition to illness, disease prevention and control work needs, in shops and pharmacies, not to go out.
截至1月31日24时，湖北黄冈市累计报告新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例726例，死亡14例，成为湖北省内仅次于武汉的第二疫情高发区。
As of 2400 hours January 31, Huanggang, Huanggang, Hubei Province, has reported 726 cases of pneumonia and 14 deaths, making it the second-highest-incidence area after Wuhan in Hubei Province.
以下是孙亮的口述：1月初的时候，妈妈因为慢性基础性疾病，在黄冈市中医院住院治疗。
The following is Sun Liang's dictation: At the beginning of January, my mother was hospitalized in Huanggang Chinese Hospital for chronic basic diseases.
妈妈患有高血压、糖尿病，这次住院是治疗并发症。
Mother has hypertension, diabetes, this hospitalization is the treatment of complications.
快出院的时候，隔壁病床住进来一个病人，呕吐得厉害，待了两天就转院了。
When I was about to leave the hospital, a patient came in from the next bed, vomited badly, and stayed for two days before being transferred to hospital.
这个病人转院那天，是1月15日，妈妈开始发低烧。
On the day the patient was transferred to hospital, on January 15, my mother began to have a low fever.
后来我们看报道才知道，中医院当时已经有很多新冠肺炎病人了，隔壁病床的病人恐怕也是。
Later, we read the report, the TCM hospital already had a lot of patients with pneumonia, the patients in the next bed are afraid so.
只是我们不知道，也没有自我保护意识。
We just don't know and we don't have a sense of self-preservation.
妈妈烧了三天，去拍了CT，发现肺部有斑片状的高密度影，1月17日，转院去黄州区人民医院。
Mother burned for three days, went to take a CT scan, found that the lungs have patches of high-density shadow, January 17, transferred to the Huangzhou District People's Hospital.
我们其实想转院去黄冈的三甲医院——黄冈市中心医院，但对方不收，现在回想，恐怕那时候他们的病人已经很多了。
We wanted to transfer to Huanggang Central Hospital, the Sanjia Hospital in Huanggang, but we didn't accept them. I'm afraid they had a lot of patients back then, I'm afraid.
这个时候，我们零零散散开始看到有关武汉市确诊新冠肺炎病人的报道，但官方口径是可防可控。
At this time, we began to see sporadic reports of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, but the official caliber is controllable.
我们当时有一点怀疑，妈妈会不会是新冠肺炎，但医院没法做核酸检测，因此也没有确诊，只能根据妈妈的抽血、CT等结果治疗。
We had a little doubt that mother would be new crown pneumonia, but the hospital can not do nucleic acid testing, so there is no diagnosis, can only be based on the mother's blood, CT and other results.
医生让我们自己出去买两种药物，美罗培南和丙种球蛋白。
The doctor asked us to go out and buy two drugs, meropenem and gamma globulin.
我们几个子女都在外地工作，一直是爸爸在陪护妈妈，买药也是他在跑。
Several of our children are working in the field, father has been accompanying his mother, buying medicine is also he is running.
说不上来是出于什么考虑或者直觉，总之我开始不断采买口罩等物资，寄回家中，也嘱咐爸爸，要戴口罩。
Unable to say out of consideration or intuition, I began to buy masks and other supplies, sent home, also told father to wear masks.
我听爸妈说，当时医生护士也都只是戴了厚一点的口罩，并没有其他任何防护措施，更谈不上隔离。
I heard from my parents that the doctors and nurses were all wearing thicker masks, with no other protection, let alone isolation.
转院之后，妈妈退烧了，也有精神跟我说话，但却逐渐呼吸困难。
After the hospital transfer, my mother had a fever, also have the spirit to talk to me, but gradually breathing difficulties.
1月19日，我听说妈妈的情况还没有好转，很着急，找人打听。
On January 19th I heard that my mother was not getting any better. I was in a great hurry and asked for information.
别人跟我说，这个情况不太好，最好赶紧去拍CT。
People tell me it's not so good. Better get a CT scan.
我就催着爸爸带妈妈去拍肺部CT。
I urged Dad to take his mother to the lung CT.
20号一早，CT结果出来，肺部情况进一步恶化，血氧只有85，低于人体正常的血氧值。
Early in the morning of the 20th, CT results came out and the lungs deteriorated further. Blood oxygen was only 85, below the normal blood oxygen level of the body.
医生说需要收进ICU。
Doctors say they need ICU.
现在看，这个决定很对，后来紧张得连床位都没有了，而妈妈得到了一定程度的护理。
Now, the decision was correct, and she was so nervous that her bed was gone and her mother received some care.
每天我们都在不断的找人、找关系、买药。
Every day we are constantly looking for people, relationships, and drugs.
中间，我们这些子女想买票回去，妈妈坚决反对，后来，哥哥带着我们买的口罩，赶回了老家，再后来，黄冈封城，我们想回去也回不去了。
In the meantime, we children want to buy tickets back, mother resolutely opposed, later, brother with our bought masks, rushed back home, and then, Huanggang sealed the city, we want to go back can not go back.
妈妈的情况持续恶化。
Mother's condition continues to deteriorate.
1月22日，妈妈打了镇静剂，插管、上了呼吸机。
On 22 January, the mother was sedated, intubated and placed on a ventilator.
也是在ICU中，妈妈最终确诊了新冠肺炎。
It was also in the ICU that my mother finally diagnosed new crown pneumonia.
1月27日，她被转进黄冈市中心医院ICU，目前仍然上着呼吸机。
On 27 January, she was transferred to the ICU of the Huanggang Central Hospital, where she is still breathing apparatus.
我四处托关系打听到，妈妈的血氧值能勉强维持在90以上了。
I asked around to find out that my mother's blood oxygen was barely above 90.
爸爸则根本没有得到妈妈这样有效的护理。
Papa, on the other hand, did not receive such effective care from his mother.
1月23日，妈妈上呼吸机的第二天，爸爸开始高烧。
On January 23, the day after my mother started breathing, my father had a high fever.
爸爸去医院拍了CT，双肺磨玻璃样。
Dad went to the hospital to take a CT, two lungs grind glass-like.
后来才明白过来，爸妈的双肺病变都是非常典型的新冠肺炎。
Later, it became clear that both parents' lung lesions were very typical of the new crown pneumonia.
我们想让爸爸住院治疗，但给爸爸拍CT的医院说不收，必须去定点医院。
We wanted Dad to be hospitalized, but the hospital that took the CT for Dad said no. We had to go to the hospital.
这时候，黄冈刚刚公布了三家定点医院和定点发热门诊。
By this time, Huang Gang has just announced three designated hospitals and fixed-point fever clinic.
于是哥哥带着爸爸去了定点医院之一的黄冈市传染病医院，医生说，必须确诊了才能住院。
So he took his father to the Huanggang Infectious Diseases Hospital, one of the designated hospitals, and the doctor said the diagnosis was necessary.
也是在这天，黄冈宣布夜里12点要封城，城里乱糟糟的，出租车也很难打。
It was also the day that Huang Gang announced that the city would be closed at 12: 00 p. m., the city was chaotic and taxis were hard to beat.
更糟糕的是，我们都不知道去哪里确诊。
To make matters worse, we don't know where to go for the diagnosis.
能求的人我全部都去求，但是还是没找到可以确诊的地方。
I asked for all the people I could ask, but I couldn't find anything to diagnose.
爸爸是军人出身，老党员，一辈子都在体制内工作。
His father was a soldier by birth, an old party member, who worked in the system all his life.
他从来都相信党、相信政府，他看到这个情况，就打算去找市政府。
He had always believed in the Party and in the government, and when he saw this, he planned to go to the city government.
我赶紧劝住他，你去找市政府，也只能见到门口的保安，不如去医院求医生。
I hastened to persuade him, you go to the city government, can only see the door of the security guard, rather than go to the hospital to see a doctor.
哥哥和爸爸又回到了最开始拍CT的这家医院，不断地求医生。
My brother and dad went back to the same hospital where CT was first taken and kept asking for a doctor.
医生拗不过他，给他开了个定点医院的住院单。
The doctor fumbled with him and gave him a committal order for the hospital.
他们赶紧跑到传染病医院去，但医院还是不收，我们后来觉得，恐怕这位开住院单的医生也知道，这张纸根本就没有用。
They rushed to the infectious-diseases hospital, but the hospital refused to accept it, and we later realized that the doctor who had ordered it knew that it was useless.
折腾到晚上十点，哥哥和爸爸眼看着实在住不进医院，拿着医生开的退烧药，只好先回家。
Toss until 10 pm, my brother and father can not live in the hospital, with the doctor prescribed antipyretics, had to go home first.
我则一直在四处求人打听，哪里可以确诊。
I've been looking around for information about the diagnosis.
有个好心人告诉我，黄冈市中心医院有试剂盒，可以确诊。
A kind person told me that Huanggang City Central Hospital has test kits, can be diagnosed.
于是，第二天一大早，爸爸和哥哥就去排队，总算做了核酸检测。
So, the next morning, my father and brother on the line, finally did a nucleic acid test.
当夜九点多，爸爸确诊了。
It was more than nine o'clock that night when Dad was diagnosed.
这天是除夕，高烧38.6度的爸爸吃了一个丸子，一碗米饭，就算过了节，早早睡了。
It was New Year's Eve, high fever 38.6 degrees Dad ate a pill, a bowl of rice, even after the festival, early sleep.
大家都没有心情，一边要让爸爸尽快确诊、尽早住院，一边还挂心着住在ICU的妈妈。
Everyone is not in the mood, while let father diagnose as soon as possible, early hospitalization, while still worried about living in ICU mother.
1月25日一早，爸爸又去了市中心医院，打了确诊单，等了两个多小时，被送到了传染病医院。
Early in the morning of January 25, my father went to the downtown hospital, made a list of the diagnosis, waited for more than two hours, and was taken to the infectious diseases hospital.
当时我们都觉得稍微有些欣慰，毕竟住进了定点医院。
We all felt a little relieved, after all, to stay in the designated hospital.
我们是真的没想到，这个医院的条件会这么差。
We really didn't expect that the condition of this hospital would be so bad.

Communicable Disease Hospital Environment.
图片来源：新浪微博网友我要在这里说明，没有任何责怪医院、医生、护士的意思。
I want to make it clear here that there is no sense of blaming hospitals, doctors or nurses.
我们作为患者家属是进不了定点医院的，一切都是听爸爸在电话里说的。
We couldn't get into the designated hospital as patients' families, everything was told by Dad on the phone.
那个地方是临时收拾出来的，爸爸进入了五病区，一个病区大概有40多个病人。
The place was makeshift, and Dad was in the Five Sick Zone, where there were about 40 patients.
我后来打听到，五病区都是情况比较重的病人。
I later learned that the five disease areas are more serious patients.
爸爸住进去的时候，里面只有床铺，设备还在慢慢搬运。
When Dad went in, there was only a bed and the equipment was moving slowly.
说到底，当时就是划出个地方，把人隔离了，其他条件都跟不上。
At the end of the day, it was time to carve out a place to isolate people, and nothing else could keep up.
那时候，医生、护士都很缺，人手不够。
At that time, doctors and nurses were in short supply and short of staff.
爸爸这样的重症病患，甚至没法全天监测血氧。
A serious patient like Dad can't even monitor blood oxygen all day long.
住进医院的第一天，爸爸打了头孢。
On the first day he was admitted to the hospital, his father spooned.
我们一听，都觉得药效不太够。
We all felt that the medicine was not effective enough.
爸爸因为陪护妈妈，也有经验，于是自己去求医生，说能不能在外面买药拿进来用，医生同意了。
My father, who was also experienced in accompanying his mother, went to the doctor and asked him if he could buy some medicine for him outside.
爸爸给我们打电话，让我们去买美罗培南。
Dad called us and told us to buy meropenan.
黄冈封城之后，哥哥就借了个电动车，买自费药给爸爸送。
After Huanggang sealed the city, my brother borrowed an electric car and bought his own medicine for his father.
所以，第二天爸爸用上了美罗培南。
So the next day my father used Meropenem.
这时候爸爸还能跟我交流，下午的时候，他又去拍了CT，不是在传染病医院拍的，而是去了市中心医院。
At this time my father can still communicate with me, in the afternoon, he took a CT, not in the infectious diseases hospital, but to the downtown hospital.
第三天，医院开了丙种球蛋白。
On the third day, the hospital prescribed gamma globulin.
但是爸爸的情况不太好了。
But dad's not doing very well.
CT结果显示，肺部情况仍然在恶化，他自己也感觉得到了，给我打电话的时候已经带着哭腔。
The CT showed that the lung condition was still deteriorating and he felt it himself. He called me crying.
第四天早上七点多，爸爸给我打了个电话，我没接到，几分钟后我打回去，爸爸说，这几天一直由志愿者餐厅送饭，他拿到的时候，都已经凉了。
On the fourth morning, more than seven o'clock, my father called me, I did not receive, a few minutes later I called back, Dad said that these days by the volunteer restaurant has been delivering food, when he got it, it was cold.
一个病区只有一个微波炉，爸爸当时已经行动困难、几乎走不了路了，无法去加热饭菜。
There was only one microwave in one of the affected areas, and Dad was already having difficulty moving and could hardly walk to heat the food.
他很想吃口热的东西。
He really wants to eat something hot.
哥哥在外面忙着买药，黄冈封城前我没来得及赶回去。
My brother was busy buying medicine outside. I didn't have time to get back before Huanggang closed the city.
我只好四处找人，求求人家能不能给我爸送一口热的。
I had to look around for someone to give my dad a warm drink.
最后不知道是哪个好心人送到了院区外，总之我爸爸吃上了一口热的东西。
Finally do not know which kind-hearted person sent to the courtyard outside, in short, my father ate a hot thing.
我当时跟医院联系，想捐微波炉。
I contacted the hospital and wanted to donate the microwave oven.
但医院因为各种原因，不敢收。
However, the hospital was afraid to accept it for various reasons.
下午，再和爸爸通电话，他的精神已经很差了，带着呻吟，他说自己可能要插管。
In the afternoon, talking to Dad on the phone again, he was already in a bad mood, groaning, and he said he might need a tube.
我四处找关系，找到了同医院另一个病区的医生，医生说，他会在第二天一早去帮我们看一看爸爸，另外希望我们多鼓励爸爸。
I looked around and found a doctor in another section of the hospital who said he would come early the next morning to help us look at Dad and hopefully we would encourage him more.
但一切都来不及了。
But it's too late.
当天晚上，医生给我们打来电话，说爸爸在抢救。
That night, the doctor called us to say that Dad was rescuing us.
过了会儿，又给我们打来电话，说爸爸去世了。
After a while, I called us again to say that Dad had died.
哥哥赶去医院，处理后事。
Brother rushed to the hospital to deal with the rest.
火葬场非常远，来回几十公里，哥哥的电动车开不过去。
Crematorium is very far back and forth dozens of kilometers, brother's electric car can not drive past.
亲戚几乎都避之不及。
Relatives were barely able to avoid it.
我们想办法，找了殡仪馆的人，求他们能带我哥哥一同过去，再送他回市里，无论多少钱都可以。
We managed to find the undertaker and begged them to take my brother with them and send him back to the city for any amount of money.
殡仪馆的人也挺好，只多收了一点钱，帮着哥哥一起，送走了爸爸。
Funeral people are also very good, only a little more money, to help his brother together, saw off the father.
整个过程里，我们非常努力，不断找人、托关系，也找渠道买药。
Throughout the process, we work very hard, constantly find people, trust relationships, also find channels to buy drugs.
可是我们再努力，也没有跑过这个病，病程发展太快了。
But we try again, also did not run this disease, the course that develops too quickly.
我想告诉更多的人，大家都看到了大别山（注：黄冈的“小汤山”医院），但你们不知道，黄冈这几个定点医院条件太差了，像爸爸这样的情况，真的是在里面等死。
I would like to tell more people, we have seen the Dabie Mountain, but you do not know that the conditions of these designated hospitals in Huanggang are very bad, such as the case of Dad, is really waiting to die inside.
黄冈的医疗条件很不好，非常需要社会各界的关注。
Huanggang medical conditions are very bad, very much need the attention of the community.
我后来看到过网友传的传染病医院图片，我根本不敢细想，爸爸最后的日子是怎么过的。
I later saw the netizen transmission of the hospital picture of infectious diseases, I did not dare to think about, Dad's last day is how to live.

图片来源：新浪微博网友现在，妈妈还在ICU插管，没有恢复清醒，也不知道爸爸的事。
Photo source: Sina Weibo netizens now, mother is still in ICU intubation, did not recover sober, also do not know father's matter.
如果老天好心的话，请把妈妈留给我，让一直贴身照顾他们的哥哥没事。
If it's kind of you, please leave me your mother, and let the brother who's been taking care of them be okay.
我总想起爸爸去世前给我打的最后一个电话。
I always think of the last call Dad made to me before he died.
他说，自己大便困难，走不了路，可能快不行了。
He said that his bowel movements are difficult, can not walk, may soon be exhausted.
我不断说，你别担心，我来想办法，我来找人，我去找医生帮你。
I keep saying, don't worry, I'll figure something out, I'll find someone, I'll get a doctor to help you.
他说，好的，战斗吧。
He said, All right, let's fight.
