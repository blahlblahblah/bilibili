送粮油、送蔬菜、送防护用品，外卖小哥们奔波在各大城市的街头，维持着城市系统的正常运转。
Food oil, vegetables, protective equipment, take-out buddies in the streets of major cities to maintain the normal functioning of the urban system.
中研产业研究院《2019-2025年快餐外卖产业深度调研及未来发展现状趋势预测报告》指出，从餐饮向非餐饮跨越，是外卖产业快速增长的重要原因。
Research Institute of Chinese Research Industry "2019-2025 fast food take-out industry in-depth research and future development trend forecast report, from catering to non-catering, is an important reason for the rapid growth of the takeaway industry.
目前外卖服务已经外溢到生活超市、生鲜果蔬、鲜花绿植、美妆、日用品、服饰鞋帽和母婴产品等更多生活场景之中。
Currently, take-out services have spilled over into more life situations such as living supermarkets, fresh fruits and vegetables, green flowers, makeup, household goods, clothing, footwear and mother-and-child products.
2月25日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦物流货运行业，光源资本创始人兼CEO郑烜乐，货拉拉创始人兼CEO周胜馥，阿里本地生活副总裁、蜂鸟即配业务负责人刘歆杨分别进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
Founder and CEO of Light Source Capital, Founder and CEO of Cargo Laboratories, Founder and CEO of Cargo Labrador Zhou Shengfu, Vice President of Local Life and Head of Hummingbird Distribution Operations Liu Xin shared their themes and had a dialogue with HE Shulong, the chief financial editor.
蜂鸟即配官方数据披露，2018年生鲜行业市场规模近5万亿，2019年第一季度蜂鸟即配生鲜活跃用户订单量超2018全年，同比增速高达384%；在订单量和商户数增速上，三四线城市分别为一线城市的1.4和1.49倍。
The hummingbird market will grow by 384% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2019, compared with 1.4 and 1.49 times that of first-tier cities in terms of order volume and number of businesses.
疫情是短暂的，行业机会是巨大的。
The epidemic is short-lived, and industry opportunities are enormous.
刘歆杨表示，这次疫情会加速餐饮、商超、生鲜以及其他零售行业的所有线下经营者对即时配送的认知，也会为线下实体带去新的经营活力。
Liu Xin said the outbreak will accelerate the catering, business ultra, fresh and other retail industry all online operators of instant distribution awareness, will also bring new business vitality to the offline entities.
机会的B面是挑战，刘歆杨坦言，蜂鸟即配在疫情期间遇到的难题主要是：骑士返城难造成的运力短缺问题以及因社区实行封闭式管理提高了服务难度。
The B side of the opportunity is a challenge, Liu Xin admits that the hummingbird during the epidemic encountered mainly: the problem of knight back to the city caused by the shortage of capacity and closed management by the community to improve the difficulty of service.
前者通过和出现劳动力过剩情况的餐饮行业联合，启动灵活就业的共享平台来解决，后者则通过与政府相关部门共同探讨，以提供更加安全的解决方案来换取配送服务通行证。
The former is addressed through a shared platform for flexible employment through alliances with the catering industry, where labour surpluses occur, and the latter through discussions with relevant government departments to provide safer solutions in exchange for distribution service passes.
关于部分快递企业一线人员抱怨的口罩短缺问题，他透露，蜂鸟即配在不同地区有不同的口罩发放标准，像在武汉重灾区是确保每个骑士每天两个N95级别的口罩，在疫情相对较轻的地区，确保每人每天一个一次性医用口罩的供给。
As for the shortage of face masks complained by front-line workers in some express delivery companies, he said hummingbirds are equipped with different mask-issuing standards in different regions, such as ensuring that each knight has two N95-level face masks per day in the worst-hit areas of Wuhan, and one disposable medical mask per person per day in areas with relatively low epidemics.
近日，不少单位、企业陆续复工复产，就蜂鸟即配业务的全面恢复时间，刘歆杨认为取决于疫情延续的时间，还取决于餐饮、零售行业的恢复情况及部分地区交通、物流、物资供给的恢复节奏。
In recent days, a number of units, enterprises have resumed work, that is, the full resumption of hummingbird business, Liu Xin, depending on the duration of the epidemic, the resumption of catering, retail industries and parts of the transport, logistics, supplies of the recovery rhythm.
以下是刘歆杨的分享及刘歆杨与燃财经的对话内容，经燃财经整理：骑士出勤一天可以减少25个家庭外出这次疫情对我们整个本地生活以及蜂鸟即配的挑战是巨大的，在特殊时期，我们服务的客户不只是餐饮以及零售的客户，还有消费者以及每天在路上奔跑的骑士都是我们的客户，此次我从三个不同的视角，分享我们本地生活的到家业务所采取的一些动作。
The following is the sharing of Liu Xin and her conversation with Flaming Finance: Cavalier Attendance Can Reduce 25 Families in a Day The challenge that this epidemic poses to our entire local life and to the hummingbird is our customer.
首先，针对广大的餐饮商户，我们迅速联合大量餐饮商户推出了“安心卡”服务，来保障商户的食品安全以及作业流程的标准化。
First of all, to the vast number of restaurant merchants, we quickly launched a large number of restaurants and restaurants "comfort card" service to ensure food safety and business process standardization.
当疫情爆发以后，我们作为本地生活服务平台看到了市民对商超快消品、药店里合规的药品以及菜场里生鲜品类大量的需求，于是快速调整了服务商户的姿势，提升了对这类本地生活供给商户的服务上限，一方面我们抓住机会为消费者提供更全面的商品供给和物流配送服务，另一方面也让这些线下生意大受影响的商户，拥有了更快速的线上渠道，在危机中促成这些品类本地化服务的形成。
After the outbreak of the outbreak, we, as a local living service platform, saw a huge demand for business ultra-fast disposables, regular drugs in pharmacies and fresh produce in the market. We quickly adjusted the position of service providers and raised the service ceiling for these local suppliers.
其次，在消费者端，安全一定是最重要的事情。
Second, on the consumer side, safety must be the most important thing.
在武汉“封城”前一周左右，我们就在全国范围上线了无接触“安心送”服务，在有效减少人与人接触的同时，确保骑士的服务能力。
About a week before Wuhan "closed the city," we had no contact on the national "peace of mind" service, in order to effectively reduce people-to-people contacts, while ensuring the service capacity of knights.
我们后台的数据显示，骑士出勤一天，至少可以减少25个家庭的外出。
Our backstage data show that knights attending a day can reduce travel by at least 25 families.
同时，我们面向消费者的服务在从原来以到家服务为主的基础上，增加了跑腿代购、生鲜自提服务。
At the same time, our consumer-oriented services from the original home-based service based on the addition of running errands, fresh self-service.
后者的服务是因为我们开放了大量在社区周边的零售小店，就近解决消费者买菜的需求。
The latter service is the result of opening up a large number of retail outlets around the community to address consumer demand for food closer to home.
另外在骑士端，我们最注重的依然是安全问题。
Also on the knighthood side, our top priority remains security.
在疫情早期，蜂鸟即配就开始实施最高等级的卫生安全举措，为骑手配发口罩，要求全国的骑士在上岗前完成口罩佩戴、体温测量、喷洒衣物消毒剂等必备流程，全面升级了对餐箱、配送车辆、配送站点等等的消毒措施，同时利用一些现代化的手段监督安全举措的落地。
In the early days of the epidemic, hummingbirds began to implement the highest level of health security measures, wearing masks for riders, requiring knights across the country to complete the necessary procedures for wearing masks, measuring body temperature, spraying clothing disinfectants before taking up their duties, comprehensively upgrading disinfection measures for food containers, distribution vehicles, distribution points, etc., and using modern means to monitor the landing of safety initiatives.
从“武汉封城”那天起，我们也调整了很多区域的营业时间，减少在特殊时间段内对运力服务安全的担忧。
Since the "Wuhan Seal" day, we have also adjusted business hours in many areas, reducing concerns about the safety of transportation services during special periods of time.
在安全之外，我们也非常重视一线骑士的报酬激励，在往年春节期间每单收入增加60%-70%的基础上，今年在疫情期间额外增加了20%左右的补贴。
In addition to safety, we also attach great importance to the rewards of first-line knights, who have increased their income by some 20 per cent this year, in addition to the 60-70 per cent increase in income per unit during the Spring Festival.
这部分补贴由平台出资。
This subsidy is funded by the Platform.
在疫情期间，我们也看到了客户之间建立起来的非常温暖的桥梁，比如很多顾客主动送口罩给顾客，我们在武汉组织了一个上百人自愿报名为医院送餐的骑士队伍，当然很多商家也加入进来，为医院提供餐品。
During the epidemic, we also saw the building of a very warm bridge between customers, such as a lot of customers volunteered to send masks to customers, we organized in Wuhan a group of hundreds of volunteers to deliver hospital meals, of course, many businesses joined in to provide meals to the hospital.
此外，我们也与地方政府协同去做一些民生和保供的工作，比如在杭州和浙江的一些地区，我们联同相关政府单位共同开发了绿色通行证，来确保疫情期间到家服务和骑士配送服务畅通无阻地进行，这种形式也是帮助政府探讨如何在危机情况下，提升城市管理水平和保障民生相关服务的管理能力和运营能力。
In addition, we have worked with local governments on livelihood and security, such as in Hangzhou and some parts of Zhejiang province, where we have worked with relevant government units to develop green passes to ensure the seamless delivery of services and knights during epidemics, and to help governments explore ways to improve the management and operational capacity of urban management and livelihood-related services in times of crisis.
总体来说，在疫情期间我们虽然遇到了非常多的困难，但是也看到了大量的机会。
Overall, we have encountered many difficulties during the epidemic, but we have also seen a great deal of opportunity.
这个机会一定要高度总结的话，我觉得是在变化之下，唯一不变的是为客户创造价值，这是渡过这次疫情最好的利器。
This opportunity must be highly summed up, I feel that under the change, the only constant is to create value for customers, this is the best way to survive the epidemic.
武汉骑士一天两个N95口罩燃财经：疫情期间，蜂鸟即配面临的最突出的难题是什么？是如何应对的？刘歆杨：突出的难题主要分成两个方面。
Wuhan Knight burns two N95 masks a day. What are the most prominent challenges hummingbirds face during the epidemic? How to cope with them?
一方面难在骑士的招募，因为从事这项工作的人多是外来务工人员，他们大多数人在春节期间已经返乡，尤其是在疫情相对严重的地区，大量的骑士无法返城。
On the one hand, the difficulty lies in the recruitment of knights, as most of the people who do this work are migrant workers, most of whom have returned home during the Spring Festival, especially in areas where the epidemic is relatively severe and large numbers of knights are unable to return to the city.
我们服务的餐饮行业，在春节期间这个旺季储备了大量值班人员，但是疫情突发，餐饮行业出现了劳动力供给的不平衡，另外蜂鸟即配的骑士短缺，我们服务的商超客户缺少内部的拣货人员，于是我们在二月初启动了灵活就业共享平台“蓝海”计划，为餐饮企业解决过剩劳动力的临时用工问题，确保他们企业的员工在特殊时期有活可以干。
The catering industry, which we serve, has a large number of staff on duty during the Spring Festival season, but with a sudden outbreak, an imbalance in the supply of labour in the catering industry, a shortage of hummingbirds, and a shortage of in-house pick-up workers for our customers.
此外，我们为骑士提供价值最高30万元保额的关爱保险，以此来应对骑士人员的招募困难问题。
In addition, we provide knights with up to $300,000 in insurance coverage to deal with the difficulty of recruiting knights.
另一方面的困难是因为非常多的城市实行封闭社区的管理方式，这提升了服务的难度和沟通成本，可能稍微好一点的小区专门设立了取餐台，但更多的情况是骑士需要在小区门口等待顾客取餐。
Another difficulty is that too many cities operate in closed communities, which makes services more difficult and more expensive to communicate with, and where there may be a slightly better neighbourhood with a special dining table, it is more likely that the knight will have to wait in front of the neighborhood for a meal.
在这方面，我们更多地是和政府一同探讨，提供更安全的解决方案，把骑士每天的安全卫生和消毒相关的标准操作，同步给相关的监管部门，在一些城市比如杭州、上海就拿到了配送服务的通行证。
In this regard, we are working more closely with the government to provide safer solutions, synchronize the daily routine of knights with safety, hygiene and disinfection, and synchronize them with the relevant regulatory authorities, and in some cities, such as Hangzhou and Shanghai, we have been issued permits for distribution services.
燃财经：蜂鸟即配给每个配送人员每天发放几个口罩？我们观察到有些快递企业的一线人员抱怨每天只给发一个口罩，满足不了需求。
We have observed front-line workers in some express delivery companies complaining that they are giving out only one mask a day, which is not enough.
刘歆杨：口罩配发很难采用一刀切的标准，我们在口罩的供应和管理上还是比较健全的，在不同的地区有不同的口罩发放标准，比如在武汉这种重灾区，是确保骑士能够拿到更多的口罩以及更高标准的口罩，我们是配发N95级别的口罩，且一直保持每个骑士一天两个的标准，而在疫情相对较轻的地区，有可能就配发一次性医用口罩，确保骑士一天一个的供给量。
Liu Xin: Mask distribution is difficult to apply a uniform standard, we are still relatively sound in the supply and management of masks, in different areas of the region, such as Wuhan, to ensure that Knights can get more masks and higher standards of masks, we are issued N95-level masks, and always maintain a standard of two per day, while in areas with relatively low epidemics, disposable medical masks are possible to ensure knights' daily supply.
燃财经：蜂鸟即配的业务如今恢复了几成？预计什么时候能够完全恢复？刘歆杨：首先我们肯定是受到了一定的影响，而且影响肯定是不小的，因为我们的客户是以餐饮行业为主的商户和品牌，本地生活业务恢复的情况，首先取决于疫情延续的时间，其次还取决于整个餐饮行业和零售行业的恢复情况。
Caijing: Hummingbird business is now back to business? When do you expect to fully recover? Liu Xin: First of all we must be affected, and the impact is certainly not small, because our customers are mainly catering businesses and brands, the resumption of local life business depends first on the duration of the epidemic, and secondly on the recovery of the catering and retail industries as a whole.
再者，在一些疫情严重的地区，交通管制带来了的物流行业运作降速和物资供给问题，这些方面恢复正常生产秩序的节奏也很重要。
In addition, in areas with severe epidemics, traffic control brings with it the problems of slowing down the operation of the logistics industry and the supply of supplies, which are also important for restoring normal production order.
燃财经：疫情期间，以顺丰、京东到家、盒马、每日优鲜、饿了么、美团为代表的企业，物流配送环节自营可控，收获了很好的用户口碑，但是一些平台型电商网站和物流快递企业表现十分乏力，你认为，原因是什么？刘歆杨：我不太觉得可以用乏力这个词，来形容或者区分不同企业对于疫情的应对，我认为最大的差别来自特殊情况和紧急情况下，企业对于自身能力的储备有没有做好准备，口碑饿了么在其中可能是相对幸运的，我们具备相对快速反应的能力和灵活调整的空间。
Flaming Finance: During the epidemic period, with Shunfeng, Jingdong home, box horse, every day good, hungry, the United States Mission as the representative of the enterprise, logistics distribution chain self-control, I think the biggest difference is not ready to use the platform electrical business site and logistics express enterprises, I think the biggest difference is not ready for their own capacity, hungry in which we have relatively rapid response capacity and flexibility.
疫情给所有实体经济的机会是公平的燃财经：通过这次疫情，你对即时配送的商业模式有了哪些新的思考？这个行业未来的机会点在哪里？刘歆杨：首先我们认为疫情是短暂的，必将春暖花开，大家一定有机会继续坐在一起烤肉，我觉得这个时刻应该很快就会到来。
The Epidemic gives all the real economy a fair chance to ignite finance: What new thinking do you have about the business model of instant distribution through this epidemic? Liu Xin: First of all, we believe that the epidemic is short-lived, will spring bloom, you will have a chance to continue sitting together barbecue, I think this moment should come soon.
关于机会点，首先我认为这次疫情对餐饮、商超、生鲜以及其他零售行业的所有线下经营者来说，是一个重新认识线上线下业务融合的机会，这个机会将是巨大的，且对所有实体经济的从业者而言都是公平的。
On opportunity, first of all, I believe that this outbreak is an opportunity for all offline operators in the catering, business, fresh and other retail sectors to re-recognize offline business integration, and that this opportunity will be enormous and fair to all players in the real economy.
线下购物线上支付这种即时配送，作为物流最新的末端发展形态，对线下业态是一种新型赋能，这次疫情加速了线下企业对这一过程的认知，就看谁能够更快速地抓住线下购物、线上支付以及即时配送这三者之间紧密结合的趋势，为线下实体带去新的经营活力。
Paying for this instant distribution offline, as the latest end-of-line development in logistics, is a new type of empowerment for offline businesses, and the epidemic has accelerated the understanding of offline businesses of the process, in terms of who can more quickly capture the close connection between offline shopping, online payments and just-in-time distribution, bringing new business dynamism to offline entities.
其次，因为这次疫情是全国范围，到家服务也就是大家习惯称之为O2O类型的服务和消费场景，在一二线城市已经是普适性的服务，但是因为三四线城市人群的消费力相对偏低，可支配时间更富裕，因此O2O服务的被接受度偏低，但是因为这次全国范围的疫情，我们认为生鲜、商超在三四线下沉市场的市场空间会进一步被打开，且以较低成本获得了海量的新用户。
Second, because the epidemic is nationwide, home service, or O2O-type service and consumption scenario, is a common service in first and second-tier cities. However, due to the relatively low consumption power and more available time, O2O service is less acceptable.
这是一个比较有意思的机会。
This is an interesting opportunity.
燃财经：未来即时配送在下沉市场的空间有多大？会遇到哪些难题？刘歆杨：我们判断，在未来非常长的一段时间里，下沉市场的空间是非常之大的，当然也会遇到一些新的难题。
Flaming Finance: How much room is there for instant distribution in the sinking market in the future? What difficulties do you encounter? Liu Xin: We judge that there is a lot of room to sink for a very long time to come, and of course there will be some new challenges.
首先是消费者端，可能因为疫情只有部分消费者的心智得到了培养，但是因为疫情是短暂的，而整个下沉市场的消费者消费习惯的培养，还需要一个相对更漫长的过程。
The first is the consumer side, probably because the epidemic has only partially cultivated the minds of consumers, but because the epidemic is short-lived, consumer spending habits throughout the sinking market will require a relatively long process.
我认为消费者在本地生活即时配送服务领域的消费心智，在未来能不能很好地拓展，依然会遇到一些难题，需要整个行业一起去努力。
I believe that consumers in the local real-time distribution services sector in the future can be a good expansion of the consumer will still encounter some difficulties, the industry as a whole to work together.
同时，三四线下沉市场的商户，对线上化的经营手段、运营方式的了解程度相对偏低，那么如何让更多商户理解和接受即时配送的服务模式，为他们打开线上化经营的大门，是我们在下沉市场推进过程中设定的一个目标。
At the same time, merchants in the three or four-line sinking market have a relatively low level of understanding of the on-line management methods and modes of operation, so how to make more merchants understand and accept the service mode of instant delivery and open the door for them to operate online is one of the goals we set in the process of sinking the market.
燃财经：一些餐饮老板“抱怨”外卖提成比例和配送费用太高，线上业务的盈利空间小，他们很担心这些费用会进一步上升。
Flaming Finance: Some restaurant bosses are worried about further increases in take-out rates and distribution costs, as well as the low profit margins in their online businesses.
你认为这会不会成为商家从线下到线上转型的一个阻力？刘歆杨：我们本地生活平台也推出了一系列相关举措，包括支持商家快速上线，包括在武汉区域分批次地减免对商家抽佣，非常时期，我们一直在尽自身的一份力量。
Do you think it will be a drag on businesses trying to make the transition from offline to online? Liu Xin: Our local life platform has also launched a series of related initiatives, including supporting businesses to fast-track online, including batch relief in Wuhan, we have been doing our part.
而从长远来讲，站在商户经营者的角度看，上述问题一定不是一个阻力，而是一个新的业务机会的打开。
And in the long run, from the point of view of business operators, the above-mentioned problems must not be a resistance, but a new business opening.
对于商家来说，堂食和线上业务所面向的客户是不一样的，这就对商家的产品研发能力和供应链管理能力提出了更高的要求。
For businesses, the parlour is different from the customer that online business faces, which puts forward higher requirements for the product R & D ability and supply chain management ability.
举一个例子，比如一个非常高品质的商家，原本做的是传统的堂食正餐，所擅长的一定是后厨按菜品形式制作的四个人以上的团餐，但是当他做线上业务，最大的挑战来自线上菜品设计、定价以及供应链采购方面的调整，以及如何将线上菜单和线下菜单在一家门店的后厨里更好地融合。
For example, a very high-quality vendor who used to cook a traditional mid-course meal must be good at cooking more than four-person meals, but when he does the online business, the biggest challenges come from online menu design, pricing and supply chain purchases, and how to better integrate online menus and offline menus in the back kitchen of a store.
一旦克服了这些困难，商家就获得了生意的新的增量空间。
Once these difficulties are overcome, businesses gain new incremental space for business.
独立盈利不是目标要做新服务和新零售的基础设施燃财经：2018年，口碑和饿了么合并，组成阿里本地生活服务公司；2019年6月，蜂鸟即配品牌独立；2月24日，阿里本地生活服务公司宣布全资收购了客如云。
Independent profit is not about new services and new retail infrastructure: in 2018, word of mouth and hunger merged to form the Ali Local Life Service; in June 2019, hummingbirds were branded independent; and on February 24, Ali Local Life Services announced a wholly owned acquisition of customers.
最近两年，阿里本地生活服务公司可谓动作频频，请问在这个体系里，蜂鸟即配承担着什么样的使命？未来是要全面开放、独立盈利，还是主要为阿里生态体系服务？刘歆杨：蜂鸟即配在去年六月份实现了品牌独立，从那时到未来3-5年里，我们在本地生活里的定位和使命就是致力于做新服务和新零售的基础设施。
Over the past two years, Ali's Local Life Services has been a prolific force. What kind of mission does a hummingbird deserve in this system? Will it be fully open, independent, or primarily for Ali's ecosystem? Liu Xin: Hummingbird became independent in June last year, and our mission in local life from then to the next 3-5 years is to develop new services and retail infrastructure.
在这个过程中我们一定不只是面向阿里生态体系提供服务，也会更进一步地开放能力，为更多社会上有及时配送需求的商家赋能。
In the process, we must not only provide services to the Ali ecosystem, but will also be more open to empower more businesses in society that have timely delivery needs.
燃财经：蜂鸟即配业务成本主要在哪些方面，如果想要独立盈利的话需要达到哪些条件？是否容易？刘歆杨：作为末端物流配送的业务形态，即时配送与快递、落地配行业相比，在末端人员的薪资方面的支出相对更高。
Flaming Finance: What are the major costs of hummingbird distribution, if you want to make a profit independently? Is it easy? Liu Xin: As an end-of-pipe logistics distribution business, real-time distribution and express delivery, landing service industry, the pay of the end-of-service personnel is relatively higher.
在蜂鸟即配的发展过程中，到目前为止我们并没有把独立盈利作为目标，对于我们而言更重要的是坚持我们“做新服务和新零售的基础设施”的定位和目标。
In the development of hummingbird matching, so far we have not set the goal of independent profit, but it is more important for us to adhere to our position and goal of "doing new services and new retail infrastructure."
燃财经：即时配送行业竞争激烈，面对美团配送、达达等对手，蜂鸟即配的竞争策略是什么样的？大家有哪些区别？本地即时配送平台之间竞争的焦点是什么？刘歆杨：即时配送的市场非常大，因此在这个市场上竞争不是主题。
Flaming Finance: The real-time distribution industry is highly competitive. What is hummingbird's competitive strategy vis-à-vis its rivals such as distribution and Dada? What are the differences? What is the focus of competition among local instant delivery platforms? Liu Xin: The instant distribution market is so big that competition is not the subject.
在我看来，也是这个原因，大家与其说是竞争，不如说大家共同努力的方向是，通过服务不同的行业去尝试更好的服务客户。
In my opinion, this is also the reason why everyone is working together to try to better serve customers by serving different industries, rather than competition.
蜂鸟即配在过程中更加关注的是所服务行业的数字化程度，我们认为即时配送行业与传统物流非常大的不同是，我们更加注重数字化和数智化，这两方面的全面推行才是这个行业效率提升的根本方式。
Hummingbird is more concerned with the digitization of the service industry. We think that the real-time distribution industry is very different from the traditional logistics. We pay more attention to digitization and digitization, which is the fundamental way to improve the efficiency of the industry.
燃财经：2020年，哪件事情对蜂鸟即配最重要？刘歆杨：2020年对于蜂鸟即配而言，最重要的事情依然是坚定我们“做新服务和新零售的基础设施”的定位和目标。
What matters most to a hummingbird in 2020? Liu Xin Yang: The most important thing about hummingbird alignment in 2020 remains our focus on positioning and targeting our "infrastructure for new services and new retail."
方法也非常明确，就是用数字化和数智化的方式去提升服务体系，就像2019年6月，我们在开品牌独立发布会上讲到的，我们在2021年前会努力建立2万个全数字化即配站点，这会更好地支撑我们在2020年-2021年实现作为基础设施的目标。
The approach is also clear: digitize and intelligently upgrade the service system, as we told our independent branding conference in June 2019, that we will strive to build 20,000 fully digital ready-to-use sites by 2021, which will better support our goal of infrastructure by 2020-2021.
