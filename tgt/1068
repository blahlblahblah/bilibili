澎湃新闻记者 李思文 实习生 薛晓咚2月13日，民间志愿者自发组成的“亲橙孝感”团队，又落实了待捐赠的100套防护服、50000个N95口罩、2.6吨大米、5吨酒精以及14台单价10万元的吸氧机，准备送往疫区一线。
Xue Xiaodong, an intern in Peng Pai, February 13, 2008. The team, composed of volunteers from civil society, made up of 100 suits of protective clothing, 50,000 N95 masks, 2.6 tons of rice, 5 tons of alcohol and 14 oxygen-absorbing machines worth 100,000 yuan each, to be sent to the epidemic area.
这支除夕夜临时组建的团队，在大年初一就筹措了700多箱医用消毒液、5000支N95口罩。
The temporary team formed on New Year's Eve raised more than 700 boxes of medical disinfectant and 5,000 N95 masks on New Year's Day.
一周内，发往孝感100多吨消毒水、20多万双手套、10多万只口罩、2万多件手术防护衣、上千件PCS防护服及护目镜。
During the week, more than 100 tons of disinfectant water, 200,000 pairs of hands, more than 100,000 surgical masks, more than 20,000 surgical suits, thousands of PCS suits and goggles were distributed.
“我们拼的是聚焦、是速度。
"We're focusing, it's speed.
不在多，在靠谱！”志愿团队核心组织人之一毛丹红说，作为民间志愿者，一腔热血之外更要专业高效，为了保障高效运转，团队将150名志愿者按照基金、采购、物流、公函、回执等小组进行划分，用“项目化”的思维对待每一份物资。
In order to ensure efficient operation, the team classified 150 volunteers according to fund, purchase, logistics, official letter, receipt and so on, and treated each item with a "project-oriented" mentality.
除夕夜发红包找队友，年初一落实5000只口罩1月24日除夕夜，在杭州阿里巴巴工作的孝感人字玉接到了老同学文胜的电话，“老家物资紧缺，你能不能搞到一些防护用品？”一通简单的电话，让字玉意识到老家孝感情况已经危急。
New Year's Eve find teammates, New Year's Eve implementation 5000 masks on January 24, Hangzhou Alibaba working filial piety words received a phone call from old classmate Wensheng, "Home supplies are scarce, can you get some protective articles?" A simple phone call, let word jade realize that the home filial piety situation has become critical.
文胜是湖北省人大代表，同时也是湖北工程学院教授，他告诉澎湃新闻，在武汉“封城”的第二天，大量物资和医院都涌向了武汉，但武汉周边高风险的城市面临着“灯下黑”的情况。
Wen Sheng, a deputy to the Hubei Provincial People's Congress and a professor at the Hubei University of Engineering, told Pangpai News that the day after the city was closed in Wuhan, a huge amount of goods and hospitals poured into the city.
“当时孝感还没传出大量病例，但整个湖北的确诊人数都在不断攀升，一旦孝感感染数量激增，普通市民和医护人员都要暴露在高风险之中。
"There was no large number of cases of filial piety, but the number of people diagnosed was rising all over Hubei, and the general public and medical staff were exposed to high risk once filial infection surged.
”文胜原本计划找化工厂的同行筹措消毒水，但春节期间认识的厂商和企业都已放假，这更加深了他的担忧。
Wensheng had planned to seek disinfection water from his chemical peers, but the company and companies he met during the Spring Festival holiday added to his concerns.
为了找到更多的物资，文胜几乎问遍了所有认识的同行和朋友，字玉就是其中之一。
In order to find more materials, Wensheng asked almost all the colleagues and friends they knew. The word jade is one of them.
当时字玉的工作群内正好在发拜年红包，挂了电话后，他也跟着发了一个红包，配文是：湖北孝感疫情严重，急寻医疗防疫物资！当地有公务人员接应，可直接对接到一线！“一开始我就是想发个红包看看谁手上有物资可以对接，没想到当天晚上就聚集起来三四十个志愿者。
After he hung up the phone, he also sent a red envelope with the following caption: Hubei filial piety outbreak, urgent search for medical epidemic prevention materials!
”字玉说，在发出这条消息后，瞬间有十几名同事私信询问，大多数都是湖北老乡。
"The word jade says, after sending this message, instantaneous a dozen colleague personal letter asks, most are Hubei Laoxiang.
其中毛丹红响应最为主动，她率先建立起了一个志愿者群，开始组建志愿团队。
Among them, Maoxihong is the most active response, she took the lead in establishing a group of volunteers, began to form a volunteer team.
她回忆称，“当时我发了一条求助朋友圈，一位餐饮企业家在凌晨看到我的求助信息后，当即联系上了一家消毒水厂家，敲定了第一批物资的捐献事宜。
"I sent out a circle of help friends and a restaurant entrepreneur contacted a disinfectant factory early in the morning to finalize the donation of the first batch of supplies," she recalls.
当两个确定性物资要对接时，我就把需求方都拉到了一起，孝感文老师也加了群，我们的志愿者工作也就这么开启了。
When the two deterministic materials to docking, I pulled the demand side together, filial piety teacher also added group, our volunteer work was also opened.
”24小时内，在字玉和毛丹红的组织下，迅速形成了一支跨多个业务部门，完全自发的“亲橙孝感”民间志愿者团队。
Within 24 hours, the words jade and Mao Dan-hong organized, quickly formed a group of fully autonomous "Orange Filial Feeling" folk volunteers across a range of business sectors.
大年初一，这支三四十人的志愿者团队，已经筹措了700多箱医用消毒液、5000只N95口罩。
On New Year's Day, the volunteer team of 30 or 40 has raised more than 700 boxes of medical disinfectant and 5,000 N95 masks.
两天后，60吨由安徽金禾捐赠的双氧水送达孝感市孝南区疫情指挥部。
Two days later, 60 tons of hydrogen peroxide donated by Jinhe, Anhui City, was delivered to Xiaoyan Xiaoan epidemic headquarters.
在短短一周内，100多吨消毒水、20多万双手套、10多万支口罩、2万多手术防护衣、上千件PCS防护服及护目镜，直抵孝感一线。
In just one week, more than 100 tons of disinfectant water, more than 200,000 pairs of hands, more than 100,000 surgical masks, more than 20,000 surgical protective clothing, thousands of PCS suits and goggles, have reached the point of filial piety.
“27号到的第一批消毒水立刻用在了孝感防控指挥中心、警务、哨卡等一线。
"The first batch of disinfectant water arrived on the 27th immediately used in filial piety control command center, police, checkpoints and so on.
”文胜说，这批消毒水帮前线支撑了十几天，解决了燃眉之急。
Wensheng said the disinfectant was on the front line for more than 10 days and met the immediate needs.
物资群内每天都传出“好消息”。
Every day there is "good news" coming out of the convoy.
本文图片均为受访者供图分小组监控物资，“项目化”运作庞大的物资链如何运作？在这个团队里，以字玉、毛丹红为核心的志愿者们负责筹备、管理、运输物资，在湖北的文胜则负责在当地进行物资对接。
In this group, volunteers with characters such as jade and red are responsible for the preparation, management and transportation of materials, while Wen Shengsheng in Hubei is responsible for the docking of materials.
字玉介绍称，志愿者团队内分为基金、采购、物流、公函、回执等小组，“我们就把物资线索当做一个项目去追踪和管理”。
The volunteers were divided into fund, procurement, logistics, official correspondence and acknowledgement groups. "We then tracked and managed the material trail as a project," she said.
“有一个物资线索，我们就会拉一个小群，然后会有一个志愿者在这个群里专门盯着这个物资，进行发货、物流的追踪。
"With a physical clue, we would pull a small group, and then a volunteer in the group would focus on the item, tracking shipments and logistics.
”字玉说，在联系的时候很多物流称能发货，但下面的营业点是什么状态，都是不确定的，每一单都需要志愿者去追踪，一旦出现问题迅速协调。
'When contacted, many logistics say they can deliver goods, but the state of the business below is uncertain, 'she said.
但在实施的过程中，他们还是遇到了层层难以想象的阻碍。
But in the process of implementation, they still encounter layers of unimaginable obstacles.
毛丹红说，物资甄别的准确性、资金采买的及时性、物流的通畅性，都是民间志愿者团队在援助疫区时常常面对的困难。
Mao said that the accuracy of the screening of materials, the timely purchase of funds, logistics accessibility, are often encountered by civilian volunteer teams in assisting epidemic areas.
在筹措资金的过程中，首先面临的困难就是“找钱”。
In the process of raising funds, the first difficulty is "change money."
“我们26号对接的几笔物资，商家都不接受先发货，一个时间差物资瞬间就被抢走了。
"We docked on the 26th a few items, the merchant did not accept the delivery, a time difference material was snatched away in an instant.
”毛丹红说，在最初成立团队时，因为资金不到位，他们已经错失了几笔物资。
When the team was first set up, they had already missed a few supplies because the money wasn't there, 'says Ms. Mao.
当时几十名志愿者们随即自发进行捐款，筹集了约10万元的公益基金，但在巨大的物资消耗面前，10万元只是杯水车薪。
Dozens of volunteers then made spontaneous donations, raising about $100,000 in public-interest funds, but in the face of a huge outlay, $100,000 was a drop in the bucket.
“我们自己没什么钱去买那么多的物资，就只能到处找。
"We don't have enough money to buy that much ourselves, so we have to look everywhere.
”字玉说，为了解决资金难题，“亲橙孝感”团队专门设置了基金组，负责对接基金会，很快便与华中科技大学校友会、北京新阳光慈善基金、爱德基金会等20余家社会爱心机构及企业进行联动。
To solve the funding problem, the team set up a fund to handle the foundation and soon joined forces with more than 20 social-care organizations and enterprises, including the Alumni Association of the University of Science and Technology in China, the New Sunshine Foundation in Beijing and the Ed Foundation.
基金组的志愿者们在明确一些基金的要求后，将筹集的资金交给采购组进行购买口罩、消毒水、防护服等紧缺物资。
Volunteers from the fund group identified the requirements of some funds, will raise funds to the procurement team to purchase masks, disinfectant, protective clothing and other scarce supplies.
物资到位后，再由物流组一个个拨打不同快递、物流公司的电话，询问是否能发货、何时能送达。
After the material arrives, by logistics group one by one dials different express, logistics company's telephone, asks whether can deliver goods, when can deliver.
由于疫情紧张，各地交通管控严格，志愿者们还需要划分出专门的组别来落实政府公函，并在疫区收到物资后给爱心机构及企业发送回执。
Due to the tight epidemic situation and strict traffic control throughout the region, volunteers also need to set up a special section to implement the official government letter, and after receiving the goods in the affected areas to send rebates to the caring organizations and enterprises.
“亲橙孝感”团队筹集的物资毛丹红说，虽然大部分志愿者都不在一线，但团队中的核心成员几乎每天十几小时都在马不停蹄地对接货源、基金、物流和地方政府。
While most of the volunteers weren't on the front line, core members of the team were docking supplies, funds, logistics and local governments for almost a dozen hours a day, says Mao Dan-hong, a team of Orange Filial Piety.
“我基本上是手机不离手，因为我打字比较快，三四天之后我的小手指就抽筋了，只能发语音。
"I was basically mobile because I typed faster, and after three or four days my little finger cramped and could only pronounce sounds.
但语音文字翻译出来总会有一些错别字，后来手指好一点了，就又开始打字。
But there will always be some mistakes in the translation of phonetic characters, and later the fingers better, began typing again.
”到了后期，志愿者小组出现了更加细致的分工：不同的志愿者分别跟进不同的物资，当群内人数达到130人后，志愿者群开启了邀约制，从而保证团队的人员可控，提高甄别物资资质的效率与准确性。
Later in the day, a more detailed division of labour emerged among the volunteer groups: different volunteers followed up on different items, and when the group reached 130, the volunteer group opened the solicitation system, thus ensuring that the team was manageable and improving the efficiency and accuracy of screening material qualifications.
截至2月13日，志愿者群里已经有150人。
As at 13 February, there were 150 volunteers in the group.
这些志愿者们来自全国各地，甚至还有越南的志愿者，他们在群里备注为“志愿者1号、2号……”很多人彼此之间并不认识，但因为帮扶孝感而成为了最亲密的队友。
The volunteers, who came from all over the country and even from Vietnam, noted in the group "Volunteer # 1, # 2..." Many people did not know each other but became the closest teammates because of their filial piety.
快递发货物流难通，因成本高弃直升机2月13日筹集的呼吸机正在检查包装，准备发往抗疫一线。
Express delivery logistics difficult, because of high-cost abandoned helicopters February 13 raised breathing machine is checking packaging, ready to send to the first line of the epidemic.
在武汉“封城”、多地交通受阻的情况下，运输问题成为了最大的难题。
Wuhan "closed the city", many traffic obstruction, the transport problem has become the biggest problem.
毛丹红说，曾有一位背着5箱口罩的越南爱心人士被卡在了海关处，得知消息后，文胜火速开车赶往指挥中心申请捐赠函，请越南海关予以放行。
A Vietnamese charity worker with a five-case mask stuck in customs office was rushed to the command center to apply for a donation letter and ask Vietnamese customs to release him, Mao said.
但爱心人士在抵达广西后，在广西关口联系多个快递公司都没能将物资直邮湖北，打车前往市中心也面临同样的问题。
However, after arriving in Guangxi, the loving personage contacted several express delivery companies in Guangxi's Guan Kou and couldn't send the goods directly to Hubei.
最后志愿者们商量出了迂回邮寄的方法，先将物资寄往广州，再由广州的志愿者联系快递公司，将5箱口罩寄往孝感。
Finally, the volunteers worked out a roundabout way to send the supplies to Guangzhou. Volunteers from Guangzhou then contacted the express company and sent five boxes of masks to the company.
字玉告诉澎湃新闻：“这次疫情又赶上过年，物流状态复杂，比如顺丰，有些地方能发，有些地方就不能发，有时候德邦说能发，但打电话过去又说不能，我们每一批物资都要挨个确认，不仅要确认发货，还要确认运输过程中各个站点的状态正常。
"The situation is very complicated, such as Shunfeng, some places can be developed, some places can not be sent, but sometimes De Ban said can be sent, but the phone said no, we have to confirm each batch of goods, not only to confirm the delivery, but also to confirm the normal state of the various stations during the transportation process.
”为了保障物资尽快抵达疫区，除了物流和快递，团队有时还要对接航空部门，“有些物资需要转运，就要飞到长沙的黄花机场，再从黄花机场找顺丰往疫区里面寄。
To ensure supplies reach the affected areas as soon as possible, in addition to logistics and courier service, the team sometimes docked with the aviation authorities. "Some materials need to be transshipped to Changsha's Huanghua Airport and sent from Huanghua airport to the affected areas.
”字玉说，有一次为了运输医用酒精，团队还沟通过直升飞机，后来发现成本太高后改换为槽运车。
The team also communicated with the helicopter once to transport medical alcohol, but later found the cost too high and switched to a tank farm, the jade said.
来自阿里菜鸟部门的志愿者孟白说，整个过程大家都是在“摸着石头过河”，“最初我们经验不够，拿到几十箱消毒水就着急发货，但实际上货散、货少的情况下更不能及时发车。
Meng Bai, a volunteer from Ali's rookie department, said: "At first we didn't have enough experience and we got dozens of cases of disinfectant to deliver the goods.
”孟白说，在后续发货时，都会将零散物资都尽量集中到一处，统一安排发货。
Meng Bai said that in subsequent shipments, will be scattered materials will be concentrated in one place, a unified arrangement for delivery.
“像有一次我们给孝感发货，车已经找到了，但货不够，我们就要继续联系基金会和厂商抢货，要凑满17.1吨，最后连夜凑货发货车，在初四晚上7：40分时候送到了孝感指挥中心。
"Like one time we sent a filial piety, the car has been found, but the goods are not enough, we will continue to contact the foundation and manufacturers to rob the goods, to complete 17.1 tons, finally overnight delivery trucks, at 7: 40 pm on the fourth day of the filial piety command center.
”孟白说，在这个过程中，自己的角色由公益组织捐助方变成了物流方，又变成了寻找货源方，接着变成了采购撮合中介，最终成为了全链条服务调度指挥者。
In the process, Mr Meng says, his role has shifted from a pro-bono donor to one of logistics, to sourcing, then to a matchmaking broker, and finally to a chain of service dispatchers.
但在运输整个过程中，也有让志愿者们特别感动的一面。
But in the whole transport process, there is also a special touch for volunteers.
毛丹红说，1月29日志愿者曾安排物资车辆前往武汉，运输900箱84消毒水，“武汉的一家派出所通过我们采买了20箱，他们来拿走那20箱消毒水的同时，还派车帮我们把剩下的消毒水分发给各家医院，我们还挺感动的。
"We were moved when a police station in Wuhan picked up 20 boxes of disinfectant water and sent a car to deliver the rest to hospitals," Mao said.
”尽管每一批物资都要经过多方协调，但“亲橙孝感”志愿者团队的物资最终都对接到了湖北、重庆、福建、浙江等省份，为一线抗疫发挥了重大作用。
Although each shipment was coordinated, the team of Orange Filial Feeling volunteers eventually received supplies from Hubei, Chongqing, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces and played a major role in fighting the first-line epidemic.
毛丹红说：“现在还是有很多人找到我们，无论是需求方、物资方还是基金会，都让我们来帮助协调。
"There are still a lot of people coming to us, whether on the demand side, on the material side or on the foundation, to help coordinate," said Mao.
我们大部分志愿者已经复工了，都是利用自己晚上的时间在落地这些工作。
Most of our volunteers have returned to work, and have spent their evenings landing at these jobs.
因此我还是希望呼吁社会人士多多关注、支持湖北。
Therefore, I would like to appeal to the community to pay more attention to and support Hubei.
