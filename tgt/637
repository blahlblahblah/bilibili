我希望是能从个人角度，发掘一些不一样的故事。

文 |应　琛1月29日，大年初五，这一天本是中国人烧香拜财神的吉日。
At the beginning of January 29, at the beginning of last year, it was a lucky day for Chinese to burn incense and worship the god of wealth.
往年，在武汉归元寺，纷至沓来的祈福人群让这里香火缭绕，成为武汉过年的盛景之一。
In previous years, in Wuhan Guiyuan Temple, poured into the blessing of the crowd so that incense around here, Wuhan has become one of the festival.
如今，一切落入寂静。
Now, everything falls into silence.
当天，是武汉“封城”后的第七天。
That day, Wuhan is "closed" after the seventh day.
下午，林晨开着车出门拍了一些视频素材，又去家附近的超市买菜，而这是“封城”后，他第二次出门买菜。
In the afternoon, Lin Chen drove out to take some video material, and then went to the supermarket near his home to buy vegetables, and this is the "closed city", he went out to buy vegetables for the second time.
也就是在这天下午，林晨收到了武汉交警的短信，武汉对私家车进行管制，之后他可能没办法开车出门。
That same afternoon, Lin Chen received a text message from Wuhan traffic police, private cars in Wuhan control, after which he may not be able to drive out.
30岁的林晨，是一名B站的UP主，网名“林晨同学”。
30-year-old Lin Chen, is a B station of the UP master, the name of the network "Lin Chen classmate."
近日，他在B站个人账号上相继推送三则疫情下的武汉现状视频，用镜头记录下武汉的“封城日记”。
Recently, he in B station personal account number successively pushed three epidemic situation Wuhan present condition video, record with the lens Wuhan "seal diaries".
令他没有想到的是，视频相继被人民日报、环球时报等媒体转发，从而火爆全网。
What did not occur to him was that the video was relayed by the People's Daily, Global Times and other media, which made it popular.
截至记者发稿，单在B站一个平台，三则视频的播放量已突破2000万。
As of the press release, in B station alone a platform, three video broadcast has exceeded 20 million.
在留言区，记者看到，回荡最多的，是全国各地人民为武汉加油的声音。
In the message area, the reporter saw, echoing the most, is the people around the country for the voice of Wuhan refueling.
“封城”是一个重要节点作为一名以Vlog为主的UP主，在做这次肺炎疫情的视频之前，林晨发布的视频大多以生活类为主。
"Seal the City" is an important node as a Vlog-based UP master, before the video on the pneumonia, Lin Chen released most of the video focused on life.
每次他都会事先策划一个主题，并以事件的形式呈现。
Each time he planned a theme in advance and presented it in the form of an event.
林晨说，最早听说有不明原因的肺炎患者，大概是在1月20号之前，“最先是我身边的朋友告诉我有肺炎，让我出门要注意，尽量少去人多的地方。
Lin Chen, who first heard of pneumonia patients with unknown causes, probably before January 20, said, "The first thing my friends told me was that I had pneumonia.
但事实上，大家当时并没有真的很在意。
But the truth is, people didn't really care.
又过了两天，看到是说得肺炎的人变多了，当时我基本上就不去人多的地方了，出门吃东西也是吃完赶紧走，都也会戴口罩”。
Two days later, when I saw that there were more people talking about pneumonia, I basically stopped going to a crowded place and went out to eat.
但林晨坦言，据他观察，当时有很多中年人或老年人，并不在意这个事情，“他们会觉得不就是个肺炎吗？或者是因为有限的信息渠道让他们觉得这个事还没有到一个更严重的状态”。
But Lin Chen admits that he observed that many middle-aged or elderly people didn't care about the issue, "Do they think it's pneumonia? Or because limited access to information makes them think it's not going to get worse."
再过了一天，也就是1月21日，林晨觉得好像事情变严重了。
Another day later, on January 21st, Lin Chen felt as if things were getting worse.
这天，他如往常一样出门采买一些生活必需品，并决定用手机镜头记录在新冠肺炎发生时，武汉人真实的生活，如超市、商圈、公司到底是什么情况。
On this day, as usual, he went out to buy some necessities, and decided to use mobile phone lens to record the real life of Wuhan people, such as supermarket, business circle, company.
拍摄过程中，他发现，尽管网络上已有不少关于疫情严重性和紧迫性的消息，街上仍有一半左右的人未戴口罩，其中，大部分是中老年人，“但当天我们年轻人其实已经都开始去抢口罩了，很多地方都卖完了”。
During the shooting, he found that despite much information about the severity and urgency of the outbreak on the Internet, about half the people in the street, most of them middle-aged and elderly, were still wearing masks.
林晨说，他希望通过这个实拍视频，提醒大家提高警惕，并提醒身边的人一定要戴上口罩。
Lin Chen said he hopes to use the live video to remind everyone to be vigilant and to remind people around them to wear masks.
翌日，林晨在B站个人账号上推出了该Vlog，截至发稿时，该视频播放量已达950余万。
The next day, Lin Chen launched the Vlog on her personal account at B station, and by the time it was released, the video had reached more than 9.5 million.
随着疫情的发展，林晨觉得可以为这次疫情专门做一期视频，“之前拍素材都是挺‘顺便’的，但拍完之后发现其实可以做得更完整一些。
As the epidemic unfolded, Lin Chen felt she could make a video dedicated to the epidemic. "It was quite 'by the way' before, but it turned out that it could have been done more completely.
于是，就有了这次比较受关注的武汉‘封城’当天的视频”。
As a result, there is this more attention to Wuhan 'closure' of the same day's video.
是的，1月23日，腊月二十九，对武汉来说是将被载入史册的一天：为应对新型冠状病毒的肆虐，当天，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部发出指令：全市城市公交、地铁、轮渡、长途客运暂停运营；无特殊原因，市民不要离开武汉，机场、火车站离汉通道暂时关闭。
To tackle the scourge of the new coronavirus, Wuhan Municipal New-style Pneumonia Command issued a directive to suspend operations on city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance passenger transport throughout the city.
此后，有着1100万人口的武汉进入“封城”时间。
Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, entered the "closed city" period.
“封城当天是这次疫情比较大的一个时间节点。
"Sealing day is a relatively large outbreak of the time node.
“林晨告诉记者，在保证安全的前提下，他决定上街再拍一些素材。
"Lin Chen told reporters that in the premise of ensuring safety, he decided to go to the street to take some more material.
当天早上，他和女友先是前往超市买菜，因为就在前一晚他和父母通了电话，决定今年不回老家过年，“当时，我们听到的消息是菜都卖完了，得赶紧去抢一点回来囤起来。
He and his girlfriend went to the supermarket to buy some vegetables the night before. He talked to his parents on the phone the night before and decided not to return home for the New Year.
”好在超市货源还算充足，只是有同样想法的人很多，进出超市都需要排很久的队。
Fortunately, the supermarket supply is plentiful, but there are a lot of people who think the same, and it takes a long queue to get in and out of the supermarket.
但这一次，林晨说，所有人都戴上了口罩。
But this time, Ms. Lin says, everyone is wearing masks.
而当林晨再次来到武汉最繁华的地方之一，他发现两天前还有三三两两行人的汉街已空无一人，店铺悉数关闭。
When Lin Chen arrived once again in one of Wuhan's most prosperous places, he found Han Street, which was deserted two days ago by two or three people, and all the shops were closed.
1月24日，大年三十这天，这则记录“封城”后24小时武汉生活、时长十分钟的Vlog上线。
The 10-minute Vlog went live in Wuhan on January 24, the 30th anniversary of the city's closure.
而片中的所有素材可以供全网使用。
All the material in the film is available for the whole network.
Play“那些坚守在岗位的人，努力让这个城市维持正常运转，作为一名生活在武汉的（前）媒体人、视频创作者身处事件中，自己能做什么？我只想用自己的方式，努力做对的事，就和千万个武汉人正在做的事情一样。
I just want to do the right thing in my own way, just as tens of millions of Wuhan people are doing, "he said.
”当记者问他屡次冒险走上武汉街头拍摄视频的原因，林晨用平和的语气给出了答案。
Asked why he had repeatedly ventured onto the streets of Wuhan to film the video, Lin gave the answer in a calm tone.
人们最想了解医院的真实情况这则Vlog，不仅让全国人民看到了疫情下真实的武汉，也让林晨在几天里收获了十余万粉丝。
People most want to know the truth about the hospital this Vlog, not only let people see the epidemic under the real Wuhan, but also let Lin Chen harvest more than 100,000 fans in a few days.
视频下，记者看到，大多数的留言都在说“武汉加油”。
Video, the reporter saw that most of the messages said "Wuhan refueling."
也有人给林晨发私信，一些人说他们需要帮助，一些人称自己是志愿者可以提供帮助，还有一些人留言叙述自己的故事。
Others sent personal letters to Lin, some said they needed help, some said they were volunteers to help, and others left a message telling their stories.
“但很多人最关心的事情，其实是武汉现在医院的情况是什么样？因为这段时间有挺多人在传武汉医院的情况是特别恐怖那种。
"But what many people are most concerned about is what the situation is like in Wuhan now, because there are quite a few people in Wuhan during this period of time the situation is particularly terrible.
”林晨坦言，他也不知道究竟怎样，“因为我们大部分当地人其实都是在家里的，没什么事也不会出去，所以我们得到的信息跟你们其实没有什么差别，也不会有人专门告诉我们怎么样。
'Because most of us are actually at home and don't go out, so the information we get is no different from what you guys are, and we're not going to be specifically told what to do.
但听身边朋友或者身边得病的人讲，医院现在确实是一个人满为患的状态，床位非常紧缺。
But listening to friends or people around the sick, the hospital is now really a state of overcrowding, bed is very scarce.
我自己的感觉是，如果症状稍微轻一点的，基本上都是自己在家里先隔离一下。
My own feeling is that if the symptoms are a little less severe, they are basically isolated at home.
”于是，林晨只能尽可能地去求证。
"So Lin Chen had to go as far as she could.
他去航拍了一段某定点医院的素材，同时又去联系了武汉本地的志愿者，除了让他们提供一线的素材外，也通过采访让志愿者来讲述一线的所见所闻。
He took an aerial photograph of a selected hospital and contacted local volunteers in Wuhan, who, in addition to providing a first-line source of material, also gave them interviews to tell what they had seen and heard.
此外，林晨又征集了一些武汉人当地的状况。
In addition, Lin Chen collected some local conditions of Wuhan people.
无人机拍摄1月27日，他把这些融合到一起，上传了第三则视频。
Drones were filmed on January 27, and he combined them to upload a third video.
这个视频是和央视合作创作的。
The video was created in cooperation with CCTV.
“大家想知道这个信息，我就把这个信息给做出来，就是这样一个简单的想法。
"Everybody wants to know this information, and I'm going to give it to you. It's such a simple idea.
虽然我目前只能通过一线的志愿者来口述还原。
Although I can only oral restorations through the front-line volunteers.
”但让林晨无奈的是，收获关注的同时，他也受到了一些质疑之声，“作为个人来做这个事情其实挺难的，有人说我是蹭热点，还有人说是发国难财，所以接下去要做什么内容，我还没有想好。
But to Lin Chen's dismay, he has also been met with some scepticism: "It's hard to do it as an individual, and I've been told that it's difficult to get rich, so I haven't thought about what to do next.
我希望是能从个人角度，发掘一些不一样的故事”。
I hope to be able to discover some different stories from a personal perspective.
但有一点值得强调的是，在林晨看来，国家在这次抗击疫情的过程中，各项决策落实得已经很快了，包括“封城”这个决定，虽然是相当严重或者说损失会非常大的一件事情，但它还是很快就给落实下来，“我有时会想，如果这个事情发生在其他地方，会不会像我们电视剧里看到的那样，封城前可能先传谣言30天，然后真的‘封城’后有一些市民来闹事。
But it is worth emphasizing that, in Lin Chen's view, the country's decision to fight the epidemic was already being implemented quickly, including the decision to "close the city," which, although quite a serious or very costly event, was quickly implemented.
但实际情况是，在武汉的人基本没有什么抱怨，我们每天在家里能不出去就不出去，然后基本的生活都能得到保障。
But the truth is, Wuhan people basically have no complaints, we can not go out at home every day, and then the basic life can be guaranteed.
只不过目前疫情确实有些严重，但我相信，一切都会过去”。
It's just that there is something serious about the epidemic right now, but I believe it will all pass.
的确，正如林晨在片中所说，各地的物资和救援力量陆续到达。
Indeed, as Lin Chen says in the film, supplies and relief efforts are arriving everywhere.
而他看到身边的人在做一些力所能及的事情——他们去拍了火神山，他们给医院送物资、送饭，他们接送医生上下班……林晨说，病毒虽然给城市带来黑云，但这座城里的人都在拼命为它洗刷让它尽快痊愈，“‌‌即使城市封闭，‌‌我知道我们也不是一座孤岛，因为有几十亿人‌‌在关心着你。
He saw people around him doing what they could - they were filming Mount Fire, they were delivering supplies and food to the hospital, they were taking doctors to and from work... Lin Chen said that although the virus brought black clouds to the city, people in the city were trying to wash it up quickly.
‌‌让我们一起，‌‌等待这座城市痊愈。
Let us take a turn to take care of the city.
到时候，‌‌欢迎‌你来武汉！”周边城市疫情也需关注现在，每天想到的时候，林晨就会给在湖北荆门的父母打电话问一下。
When the time comes, Zhenquan welcome you to Wuhan! "The peripheral urban disease also need to pay attention to the present, every day thinking, Lin Chen will be in Hubei Jingmen parents will call to ask.
据他了解，老家的家人目前也是自我隔离在家，能不出门就不出门，“比如说，我妈妈在监狱里面上班。
As far as he knows, the family back home is also self-isolated and can stay in the house without going out. "For example, my mother works in a prison.
她工作的监狱现在已经封监了。
The prison where she works is now closed.
然后她们单位每天都会去我家门口喊她两声，如果人不在的话，单位的措施是不在我就扣你分，或者给记过什么的”。
Then their unit will go to my door every day to call her two, if the person is not, the measure of the unit is not I deduct you, or what have been recorded. "
林晨告诉记者： “其实湖北周边的那些城市情况也挺严重的。
Lin Chen told reporters: "In fact, Hubei peripheral cities are also quite serious.
一方面他们生病的人也很多，然后医院的物资其实也非常紧缺。
On the one hand, they also have a lot of sick people, then the hospital supplies are also very scarce.
但大家现在都比较关注到武汉这边，周边这些城市受到的关注相对少一些，得到的援助也会少一些。
But everyone is now more concerned about the Wuhan side, the surrounding cities receive relatively little attention and less aid.
”不过，这一情况已经得到了有关方面的高度关注。
However, the situation has received a lot of attention.
1月29日晚上，湖北省召开新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情防控工作新闻发布会，通报全省疫情和防控工作最新进展情况。
On the evening of January 29, a press conference was held in Hubei Province on the prevention and control of the coronavirus-infected pneumonia.
湖北省省长王晓东在发布会上表示，医疗物资保障很紧缺，不仅武汉及周边城市存在短缺，全省其他地方普遍严重不足。
'There is a shortage of medical supplies, not only in Wuhan and surrounding cities, but also in other parts of the province, 'said Wang Xiaodong, governor of Hubei province.
当被问及湖北其他地市如何加强防控时，王晓东称，市、州的疫情防控当务之急就是加强重点地区、重点人员的防控，现在黄冈、孝感、荆门、咸宁等地的形势比较严峻，特别是黄冈，确诊和疑似病例累积超过1000人，“我们绝不能让黄冈成为第二个武汉。
When asked how other cities in Hubei Province can strengthen prevention and control, Wang said that the most urgent task for prevention and control of the epidemic in cities and counties is to strengthen key areas and prevent and control key personnel.
为此，省里已经决定派出工作组进驻黄冈，其他市州也派驻了督导组，坚持早发现、早诊断、早隔离、早治疗，才能为疫情的防控争取主动”。
To this end, the province has decided to send a team to Huanggang, other cities and counties also stationed supervisory groups, adhere to early detection, diagnosis, early isolation, early treatment, so that the prevention and control of the epidemic can take the initiative.
