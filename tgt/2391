Wuhan Diary This winter, we encountered an unprecedented "new coronavirus pneumonia," encountered unprecedented impact, epidemic prevention is the focus of the people of the country.
在封城之后，在重点疫情区的武汉人民过得怎样？南方都市报官方微信将陆续推出“武汉日记”，通过武汉当地人的讲述看看他们过得怎样。
The official letters of the Southern Metropolis Daily will issue "Wuhan Diary" to see how the local people in Wuhan have fared.
武汉日记④罕见病儿一家三口被困武汉2月29日，第13个国际罕见病日如期而至。
Wuhan Diary Three Children Trapped in Wuhan Feb. 29, the 13th International Rare Disease Day came as scheduled.
新冠肺炎疫情之下，原本就承受病痛的罕见病群体，面临了新的困境。
With the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, the rare disease group, which is already suffering from illness, is facing a new dilemma.
“孩儿听话莫动啊……”周先生像捏飞镖一样捏着针管，顿了一秒，把一指节长的针头扎进宝宝大臂。
"Children obedient motionless........" Mr. Zhou holds the needle like a dart, paused for a second, and thrust a knuckle-length needle into the baby's big arm.
刚出生两个多月的儿子顿时从“咿呀”升级为大哭。
More than two months after his birth, his son suddenly went from baby to crying.
夫妻俩跪在地上，妻子刘女士按住侧躺在床角的孩子。
The couple knelt down, and his wife, Mrs. Liu, held down the child in the corner of the bed.
“莫动莫动，”周先生抽出捏针管的右手，把红色的维生素B12注射液慢慢推进儿子体内。
"Don't move," Mr. Zhou pulled out his right hand to pinch the needle and slowly pushed the red vitamin B12 into his son's body.
突然降临的新冠疫情，逼这位37岁的半挂卡车司机学会了这项新技术。
The sudden arrival of the new crown forced the 37-year-old semi-trailer driver to learn the new technology.
照着之前护士给孩子打针的视频，他先拿自己做过模拟实验，“看怎么打不痛，是推快还是推慢”。
Following the nurse's previous video of the child being given an injection, he did a simulation of his own experiment, "see how to hit the pain, is pushed fast or slow."
眼下，周先生一家困在了武汉。
At present, Mr. Zhou's family is stranded in Wuhan.
封城之前，他们带刚出生的儿子康康来武汉看罕见病。
Before the city was closed, they brought their newly born son, Kang Kang, to Wuhan to see a rare disease.
甲基丙二酸血症，一种常染色体隐性遗传病。
Methylmalonic acid, an autosomal recessive hereditary disease.
疫情打断了治疗，儿子赖以生存的药物和特殊配方奶粉所剩无几。
The outbreak disrupted treatment and left little of the medicines and special formula on which his son depended.
武汉快递不方便，医疗资源也不得不向新冠肺炎患者大量倾斜，他们也无从补给。
Wuhan Express is not convenient, medical resources have to be heavily tilted to patients with pneumonia, they also have no supply.
患罕见病甲基丙二酸血症的两月大宝宝康康。
A 2-month-old baby with a rare disease, methylmalonicemia.
廉价酒店外，路上空无一人，偶尔有外卖小哥骑着电动车穿过。
Outside the cheap hotels, the road was deserted, with occasional take-out boys riding electric cars.
刘女士哄着儿子，孩子胳膊上慢慢肿起了大包。
Ms. Liu coaxed her son into a swelling on his arm.
Play【南都N视频】视频：南都特派记者 陈冲 吴斌 后期：张驰 编辑：陈蓓蕾患病医生一度劝周先生放弃。
The doctor once advised Mr. Zhou to give up. The doctor once told him to give up.
这是周先生和妻子刘女士的第3个孩子，今年元旦出生，取名康康。
This is Mr. Zhou and his wife Ms. Liu's third child, born this New Year's Day, named Kangkang.
但康康生来就患有甲基丙二酸血症。
But Kang Kang-sheng suffers from methylmalonicemia.
甲基丙二酸是人体代谢产物，正常情况下可快速排出体外。
Methylmalonic acid is a metabolite of human body, which can be excreted rapidly under normal circumstances.
但患有这种遗传病的人，甲基丙二酸会在血液中逐渐积累，从而导致甲基丙二酸血症。
But in people with the condition, methylmalonic acid builds up in the blood, leading to methylmalonicemia.
严重者，会出现神经、肝脏、肾脏、骨髓等的损伤。
Serious person, can appear nerve, liver, kidney, marrow wait for injury.
这种常染色体隐性遗传病，已被纳入国家卫健委第一批罕见病目录。
This autosomal recessive genetic disease has been included in the first list of rare diseases of the National Health Commission.
小康康一家住在湖北襄阳宜城农村。
The well-off Kang family lives in the Yicheng countryside of Xiangyang, Hubei.
2017年，康康曾有过一个姐姐，但出生5天就不幸夭折，当时没能查出病因。
In 2017, Kangkang had an older sister who died five days after her birth, but was unable to identify the cause.
医生后来判断，可能正是因为甲基丙二酸血症。
Doctors later determined that it was probably methylmalonic acid.
周先生展示小康康的血液化验单。
Mr. Zhou showed off Xiao Kang's blood laboratory sheet.
康康刚出生时有些缺氧，医生给他吸了一个半小时的氧气，并告诉爸爸周先生，如果孩子有嘴发青、脸发白等症状，就及时通知医生。
Kangkang was born a little hypoxic, the doctor gave him an hour and a half of oxygen, and told his father, Mr. Zhou, if the child has blue mouth, white face and other symptoms, timely notify the doctor.
小康康当时看起来很正常，但考虑他姐姐的经历，父母“从心里面担心害怕”，就把他留在保温箱让医生继续观察，“他们比我们懂得多”。
Well-off Kang looked normal at the time, but considering his sister's experience, the parents, "worried and frightened from the heart," left him in the incubator for the doctor to continue to observe, "They know more than we do."
小康康的身体一天比一天不好。
Well-off health is getting worse every day.
出生第三天的时候，新生儿肺炎和黄疸同时出现，呼吸很快，每分钟超过80次，并发胸口塌陷。
On the third day of life, neonatal pneumonia and jaundice occur simultaneously, breathing rapidly, more than 80 times per minute, and chest collapse.
放弃宜城医疗条件有限，医生束手无策，建议他们转院到“大一点”的襄阳市中心医院治疗。
Give up Yicheng medical condition is limited, the doctor is helpless, suggest they transfer hospital to "bigger" Xiangyang city center hospital treatment.
转院后，小康康经历两次抢救，效果都不好。
After the transfer, Xiaokang experienced two rescues, the effect is not good.
1月7日，医生安排小康康采血做遗传代谢病检测。
On January 7, doctors arranged for Xiaokang to take blood for a genetic metabolic disease test.
3天后，从武汉发回的检测报告显示，他可能患有甲基丙二酸血症。
Three days later, a test report from Wuhan showed that he might be suffering from methylmalonic acid.
虽然甲基丙二酸血症是罕见病，但并非无法救治。
Although methylmalonicemia is a rare disease, it is not incurable.
除了常规药物外，医生建议小康康喝一种特殊奶粉，不含异亮氨酸、蛋氨酸、缬氨酸、苏氨酸，限制天然蛋白质摄入，以减少“致命”的甲基丙二酸的产生。
In addition to conventional drugs, doctors recommend Kang to drink a special form of milk powder that does not contain isoleucine, methionine, valine or threonine, and limits natural protein intake to reduce the production of the "lethal" methylmalonic acid.
因为患罕见病，小康康只能喝特殊配方奶粉。
Due to a rare disease, Kang can only drink special formula milk.
不过，这种奶粉并未在国内上市，医生让他们想办法海淘。
However, the milk powder is not on the domestic market and doctors are asking them to find a way out.
爸爸周先生找不到人，还是医生帮忙联系了上海的卖家，买了一罐特殊奶粉，寄过来要等好几天。
Dad Mr. Zhou could not find anyone, or the doctor to help contact the seller in Shanghai, bought a can of special milk powder, sent to wait for several days.
与此同时，小康康的病情正在恶化，医生提醒周先生注意。
Meanwhile, Xiaokang's condition is deteriorating, and the doctor alerted Mr. Zhou.
周先生回忆，孩子当时的脑电压特别低，血小板也在减少，各种身体衰弱的迹象逐渐显现，“医生劝我们放弃”。
"Doctors advised us to give up," Zhou recalled, referring to a time when the brain voltage was particularly low and platelets were decreasing and signs of debilitating conditions were emerging.
“当时心里面特别难受，我们失去过宝宝，我想再看看他，出生后都没看到两眼”，医生的话让周先生一家人想起了3年前的经历，二女儿出生后一直住院，插管时也很痛苦。
"We lost our baby, I wanted to see him again, I didn't see him after birth," he said, reminding the family of his experience three years ago, when his second daughter was hospitalized and had painful intubation.
“我们受不了了，就和宝宝妈妈商量，宝宝有这个病，既然他要走，我们就想让他还能看我们的时候看一下，我们抱一下。
"We couldn't take it any more, so we talked to our mother about it, and since he was going to leave, we wanted him to look at us and hold him.
”周先生说。
"said Mr. Zhou.
好转由于无法正常代谢，小康康出生后“一口奶没吃过”，只能饿着。
Improved due to normal metabolism, after the birth of well-off Kang "a mouthful of milk has not eaten", can only be hungry.
决定出院的第二天，周先生在医院见到孩子，小康康瘦得只剩“一层皮在上面”，嘴唇也是干的，医生给孩子做了补水，但远远不够。
The day after the decision to leave the hospital, Mr. Zhou saw the child in the hospital, well-off and thin only "a layer of skin on top," the lips are dry, the doctor gave the child a refill, but not enough.
医生告诉周先生，宝宝体内的血小板正在减少，内脏、脑部随时可能出血，“你接出宝宝，可能也坚持不到明天”。
The doctor told Mr. Zhou that the platelets in the baby's body were decreasing and that the internal organs and brain could bleed at any time.
爸爸和妈妈担心小康康像姐姐一样离开，也怕家里的爷爷奶奶不能承受，就在宜城找个了酒店先住下，“陪孩子最后的时间”。
Father and mother worry about well-off Kang like sister to leave, but also afraid of the family grandparents can not bear, in Yicheng found a hotel to stay, "the last time with the children."
在酒店，妈妈试着给小康康喂母乳和普通奶粉。
At the hotel, mom tries to feed Xiaokang breast milk and plain milk powder.
不久后，一直没哭过的小康康会哭了，在爸妈眼中，这是孩子在好转的信号。
Before long, well-off Kang, who had not cried, would cry. In the eyes of her parents, it was a sign that her children were getting better.
“感觉宝宝好像舍不得离开我们”。
"Feel the baby seems to be reluctant to leave us."
小康康确实有了变化，吃得更多，哭声更响了。
Well-off Kang has indeed changed, eating more, crying louder.
三天后，爸爸妈妈带着他又到医院复查，血小板竟然恢复正常。
Three days later, his father and mother took him to the hospital to review, platelets even returned to normal.
医生认为，他自身可能在恢复。
Doctors think he may be recovering himself.
看着小康康在慢慢好转，周先生把病情告诉了家里的老人。
Looking at the well-off Kang slowly improving, Mr. Zhou told the old people at home.
老人想让孙子先回家，“我们就这样养着，看孩子有没有什么奇迹会发生”。
The old man wanted his grandson to go home first. "We just kept it like this to see if there were any miracles."
小康康在妈妈怀里熟睡。
Kang is asleep in her mother's arms.
从上海快递的特殊奶粉，此时也寄到了他们手里。
The special milk powder from Shanghai Express was also sent to them at this time.
在买奶粉时，周先生进了一个甲基丙二酸血症的病友群。
While buying the milk powder, Mr. Zhou entered a group of patients with methylmalonic acid.
病友们有对抗这个病的经验，听说周先生把孩子带回家等奇迹，大家都很着急，让他们不要放弃。
Patients have experience of fighting the disease, heard that Mr. Zhou brought the children home and other miracles, we are very anxious, let them not give up.
一位病友告诉周先生，很多医生可能不了解甲基丙二酸血症，让他带孩子尽快找合适的医生治疗。
One patient told Mr. Zhou that many doctors might not know about methylmalonic acid and asked him to take his child to a suitable doctor as soon as possible.
他打听到，武汉儿童医院和武汉协和医院可能有条件。
He learned that Wuhan Children's Hospital and Wuhan Concorde Hospital may have conditions.
“那个时候我们还想再救救宝宝，我已经放弃过他一次，不想再放弃了。
"We wanted to save the baby again. I gave him up once and I didn't want to give up.
”求医1月19号，爸爸叫了顺风车，和妈妈带着小康康去了武汉。
"Looking for a doctor On January 19, my father asked for a free ride with his mother and went to Wuhan.
路上开了5个多小时，微信群里的病友们也在不断分享自己带孩子检查、治疗的经验，还叮嘱他们不要耽误治疗。
For more than five hours on the road, the sick people in the microphone group shared their experiences of taking their children for tests and treatment and told them not to delay treatment.
周先生带小康康武汉求医不久，武汉开始“封城”。
Zhou Xiangkang xiaokang Wuhan sought medical treatment, Wuhan began to "seal the city."
在武汉市儿童医院，小康康做了更详细的检测。
In Wuhan Children's Hospital, Xiaokang did a more detailed test.
化验报告显示，他的C3值在增长，说明甲基丙二酸正在体内堆积。
Laboratory reports showed that his C3 level was increasing, suggesting that methyl malonic acid was accumulating in the body.
周先生告诉南都记者，由于甲基丙二酸不断堆积，普通的感冒都可能把孩子拖垮，若是出现感染，“宝宝是抗不过去的”。
Mr. Zhou told Nandu that because of the accumulation of methyl malonic acid, common colds can bring down children. If infected, "babies can't fight it."
“你们要小心。
"Be careful.
”医生叮嘱。
'the doctor ordered.
为了给小康康省出住院费、治疗费，一家人在武汉儿童医院附近的廉价酒店里租了间房，一天99元。
The family rented a room at a cheap hotel near Wuhan Children's Hospital for 99 yuan a day to pay for hospital and treatment.
为了给小康康治病，困在武汉的一家人。
To treat Xiaokang, a family stranded in Wuhan.
周先生平时在上海开半挂货车，往返各个码头间运送进出口集装箱，月工资5000多元。
Mr. Zhou usually drives a half-truck in Shanghai to transport the import and export containers between the terminals, more than 5000 yuan a month.
他的父亲在他很小的时候就丧失了劳动力，手术去掉了两节脊椎，认定为9级残疾。
His father lost a workforce when he was very young, and the surgery removed two vertebrae, which were deemed to be disability level 9.
初中的时候，周先生学习不好自愿辍学，哥哥虽然成绩较好，但因家庭条件也没有再读书。
In junior high school, Mr. Zhou did not learn to drop out of school voluntarily. Although his brother did better in school, he did not study again because of family conditions.
兄弟俩下地种田、外出打工，日子慢慢上正轨了。
The two brothers worked outside their fields and got on with their lives.
等到哥俩都结了婚，生活也走上了正轨。
By the time both were married, life was back on track.
2010年，周先生有了自己的大儿子。
In 2010, Mr. Zhou had his eldest son.
2016年，“全面二孩”政策放开的时候，夫妻俩想给孩子找个伴儿又怀了一胎，二女儿却不幸去世。
When the "two-child policy" was liberalized in 2016, the couple tried to find a partner for their child and conceived another child, but the second daughter died.
如今，三儿子小康康患上了折磨人的罕见病，医生告诉他们，治不治在于父母，治疗需要精力，也需要更多的金钱。
Now, with her third son, Kang-kang, suffering from a rare and debilitating illness, doctors tell them that the cures lie with the parents and that treatment requires energy and more money.
“我们想治，宝宝也不能看着不管了，然后医生就给我们办了入院。
"We wanted to treat it, and the baby couldn't look at it anymore, so the doctor admitted us to the hospital.
” 周先生说。
"said Mr. Zhou.
一家人蜗居的武汉酒店房间，悬挂着小康康的衣服。
A family living in a hotel room in Wuhan, hanging well-off clothes.
支援当小康康在武汉看病时，新冠病毒悄然在武汉城内快速传播。
Support When Xiaokang saw a doctor in Wuhan, the new crown virus quietly spread in Wuhan City.
1月23日10点，武汉封城，周先生这才反应过来，一家人被困在了武汉。
January 23 10: 00, Wuhan sealing the city, Mr. Zhou responded, the family was trapped in Wuhan.
这座突然切换了一种模式的城市，发热门诊挤入超过平时几十倍的患者，各医院、各科室都相继改造为传染病病区。
This suddenly switched a model of the city, fever clinic crowded into more than ten times the usual number of patients, hospitals, departments have been transformed into infectious disease areas.
每万人三甲医院数排名全国第一的武汉，此时已无暇顾及其他病人。
Wuhan, the country's No. 1 hospital for every 10,000 people, has no time to think about other patients.
到1月底，武汉市儿童医院内部也出现了疑似感染新冠肺炎的儿童。
By the end of January, children suspected to be newly infected with pneumonia had also appeared inside Wuhan Children's Hospital.
2月1日，医院安排小康康出院。
On February 1, the hospital discharged Kang Xiaokang.
医生给他开了每天口服的左卡尼丁，并要求继续吃特殊配方奶粉。
He was prescribed the daily oral levokalidine and asked to continue to take special formula.
另一种关键药物，是隔一天打一针的维生素B12注射液。
Another key drug is a vitamin B12 injection given every other day.
但按医院的规定，注射液和针管不能外带。
But according to the hospital regulations, injection and syringe can not be taken outside.
好在医生帮他从病友那里借到了药，周先生骑车3小时取了回来。
Fortunately, the doctor helped him to borrow the medicine from his patient, Mr. Zhou bicycled back three hours to get it back.
小康康最近这段时间使用的维生素B12和针管，都是这位病友提供的。
Well-off Kang recently used vitamin B12 and syringe, are provided by the patient.
武汉严格交通管制后，这位病友又向有关部门申请了一次，给他寄过一次药。
Wuhan after strict traffic control, the sick friend again applied to the relevant departments, sent him a drug.
之前的病友群也发挥了大作用。
The group of former patients also played a big role.
群里一位武汉家长给小康康带了一罐奶粉应急，只象征性地收了几十块钱，“我也只能帮你到这了”。
A Wuhan parent in the group gave Xiaokang a can of milk powder emergency, only a token of the dozens of dollars, "I can only help you here."
另一位广东的家长，给他寄了3罐特殊配方奶粉。
Another parent from Guangdong sent him three cans of special formula.
爸爸为小康康注射维生素B12注射液。
Dad injected Xiaokang with vitamin B12 injection.
打完针，爸爸给小康康做针口消毒。
After the injection, father to well-off Kang do needle disinfection.
断粮疾病在消耗着这个家庭。
Food deprivation is eating away at the family.
蜗居在小旅馆里，周先生之前存的钱已经花光，借的钱也不多了，只剩下病友家长们捐的几千块钱。
Dwelling in a small hotel, Mr. Zhou before the savings have been spent, the money borrowed is not much, only the parents of sick friends donated thousands of dollars.
夫妻俩早饭只能吃泡面，“吃到快要反胃”。
The couple can only eat noodles for breakfast, "eat to the stomach."
好在午饭和晚饭有志愿者提供的盒饭，周先生每次骑车3公里去取。
Fortunately, lunch and dinner are provided by volunteers boxed rice, Mr. Zhou bikes 3 kilometers every time to pick up.
小康康也可能断粮。
Well-off Kang may also be without food.
维生素B12注射液和左卡尼丁口服液只剩一个月的量。
Vitamin B12 injection and levokalidine oral liquid have only one month left.
口服液医院尚能开出，注射液和针管只能靠自己想办法。
Oral liquid hospital can still be opened, injection and syringe can only rely on their own way.
关键的特殊配方奶粉，只够他吃一周。
The key special formula was just enough to last him a week.
患有罕见病，小康康一生都要靠药物支撑，特殊配方奶粉也不能断，他的成长需要营养。
With a rare disease, well-off Kang has to rely on drugs throughout his life, special formula can not be broken, his growth needs nutrition.
小康康的注射药品，他一生都要靠药物支撑。
Kang Kang's injection of drugs, he has to rely on drugs throughout his life.
人困在武汉，快递也不方便，奶粉和药品都难以补给。
People stranded in Wuhan, express delivery is not convenient, milk powder and drugs are difficult to supply.
非常时期，罕见病病友群里的家长们，也只能每天鼓励周先生夫妇不要放弃。
In times of emergency, parents of the rare ill and sick can only encourage Mr. and Mrs. Zhou not to give up every day.
病毒暂时被隔绝在酒店之外，感染的风险却无处不在。
The virus is temporarily isolated from the hotel, but the risk of infection is everywhere.
围城之中，爸妈现在只想带小康康回老家，至少能让他晒晒太阳、透透风、洗澡和换衣服。
In the middle of the siege, my parents just wanted to take Kang back to his hometown, at least to let him get some sun, some air, some bath and some clothes.
“不管宝宝以后会是什么结果，我们还是想回去。
"Whatever happens to the baby later on, we want to go back.
”但他们也担心，自己从武汉出来，回家会给政府、会给好多人添麻烦。
But they also worry that coming home from Wuhan will cause trouble for the government and many others.
回想起武汉刚封城的时候，周先生乐观的估计是14天，“熬过去就回去”。
Recalling Wuhan Gangfeng City, Mr. Zhou optimistic estimate of 14 days, "get through it go back."
可三十多天过去了，这场疫情还暂时看不到尽头。
But more than 30 days have passed, the epidemic is still not an end in sight.
每次看到躺在床上的儿子会哭、会挥手的时候，周先生和妻子都觉得他和正常孩子一样——他们一直不相信儿子会得这种病。
Every time he sees his son in bed crying and waving his hand, Zhou and his wife feel like normal childrenthey never believe their son will get the disease.
