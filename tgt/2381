燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孟亚娜编辑 | 周昶帆过去两年资本市场投资放缓，创投形势整体低迷，AI行业也迎来了资本寒冬。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former Creator & # 45; Meng & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;
一方面，企业期盼早日融资，继续在应用层面技术落地；另一方面，早期投资机构则想要退出获利。
On the one hand, companies look forward to early financing and continue to land their technology at the application level; on the other, early-stage investors want to exit profits.
但人工智能在实际应用中远不如预期，“AI泡沫破灭论”甚嚣尘上。
But artificial intelligence is far less widely used in practice than expected, and "AI bubble bursting" is rampant.
在华创资本熊伟铭看来，每个新领域的出现都会伴随着所谓泡沫，但泡沫并非毫无意义，比如它推动了行业人才的培养。
According to Huacheng Capital Xiong Weiming, the emergence of every new sector is accompanied by a so-called bubble, but it is not meaningless, for example, because it promotes the development of talent in the industry.
另外，人工智能在医疗领域的应用也开始落地，开始聚焦到生命科学制药领域。
In addition, the application of artificial intelligence in medical field also began to land, began to focus on the pharmaceutical field of life science.
熊伟铭给创业者提出了建议，如果要在这个领域创业，从制药领域上下游和周边切入，会比较有优势。
Xiong advises entrepreneurs that they would have an advantage if they were to start a business in the field, cutting it upstream and downstream from the pharmaceutical industry.
当下受到疫情影响，很多中小企业也面临现金流危机。
Affected by the current epidemic, many small and medium-sized enterprises also face cash flow crisis.
“如果悲观估计，企业很可能半年内都没有现金流流入。
"If pessimistic estimates are made, businesses are likely to have no cash flow in half a year.
这种情况下创业者就需要做出调整，如果企业钱太少，来不及转身或者改变，不如减产和休眠，如果还有一部分资金能够支撑七、八个月，可以做一些新的尝试。
In this case, the entrepreneur needs to make adjustments. If the business has too little money to turn around or change, it might as well cut back and go to sleep. If there is still some money left to last seven or eight months, try something new.
”熊伟铭说。
'he said.
2月27日，燃财经举办线上沙龙，主题聚焦于AI行业，华创资本合伙人熊伟铭、旷视副总裁谢忆楠、快仓智能联合创始人孙宇进行了主题分享，并和燃财经总编辑贺树龙做了对话。
On Feb. 27, 2007, Flaming Finance hosted an online salon focusing on the AI industry. Huacheng Capital Partner Xiong Weiming, absentee Vice President Xie Yanan, co-founder of Qifang Intelligence Co-founder Sun Yu, and held a dialogue with HE Shulong, chief financial editor.
以下是熊伟铭在燃财经沙龙上的详细分享内容：互联网之后是什么时代？我们缺乏共识这次疫情和2003年相比，前几天清华大学国家金融研究院院长朱民老师在演讲中表示，两个季度可能会造成大概1.38万亿的直接损失，大部分来自线下的企业。
The following is a detailed account of Xiong's share of the business salon: "What's the Age After the Internet? We lack consensus This outbreak is likely to cause about $1.38 trillion in direct losses in two quarters, mostly from offline companies, 'Zhu Min, dean of the National Institute of Finance at Tsinghua University, said in a speech in 2003.
这段时间任何有线下交付部分业务的商业都会受到严重影响，由于我国经济体量和城镇化程度的大幅提升，这次影响将会大大高于2003年。
Any offline delivery of part of the business during this period will be seriously affected, and this time the impact will be significantly higher than in 2003 as a result of the substantial increase in the size and urbanization of our economy.
据BCG联合经济学人智库做的最新预测，2020年中国GDP增速最悲观在4.5%左右。
According to the latest projections by the BCG Joint Economist Intelligence Unit, China's GDP growth in 2020 will be the most pessimistic around 4.5 per cent.
但相对于我国整个百万亿级的经济体总量来讲，这个数据依旧乐观。
But the numbers remain positive relative to the country's economy as a whole, which is trillions of dollars.
相较于2003年非典期间，我国GDP增长的结构发生了较大变化。
Compared with the SARS period in 2003, the structure of China's GDP growth has changed greatly.
2018年以来，国家开始做结构性转型和改变金融政策。
Since 2018, the country has been engaged in structural transformation and financial policy changes.
但市场却遇到了各种不确定因素的冲击，金融政策上的急刹车让很多中小企业遭受了一波冲击；中美贸易谈判让很多出口型企业受到影响；新冠肺炎疫情则让一些本地消费企业有了很大损失。
But markets have been buffeted by uncertainties, with sharp brakes on financial policy hitting many small and medium-sized enterprises, China-US trade talks that have affected many export-oriented companies, and the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic that has taken a heavy toll on some local consumers.
2019年年底，美团王兴说了一句话，“2019年是过去10年里最差的一年，却是未来10年里最好的一年。
At the end of 2019, US group Wang Xing said, "2019 is the worst year in the past 10 years, but the best for the next 10 years."
”其实在2019年，一级市场投资就已经慢慢放缓。
In fact, investment in tier 1 markets has slowed in 2019.
除了金融大政策的变化外，基本面也在发生很多变化。
In addition to the broader financial policy changes, the fundamentals are also changing a lot.
我从技术角度出发，总结了以下三点：第一，全球范围内消费互联网已经达到瓶颈。
From a technical point of view, I summarized the following three points: First, worldwide consumption of the Internet has reached a bottleneck.
当然非洲除外，非洲20亿的年轻人基础设施还未到位，现在仍然面临着一个全新的状态。
Of course, with the exception of Africa, where 2 billion young people lack the infrastructure, it is still facing a completely new situation.
在中美两个人口大国，消费互联网的渗透率已经非常高了。
In two populous countries, China and the United States, Internet penetration is already very high.
从一些宏观数据上看，我国已经迎来了发展的新拐点。
From some macroscopic data, China has welcomed the new inflection point of development.
截至目前，我国线上人数已经多达11亿，零售市场已经达到5.6万亿美元左右，已经超过了美国。
So far, China's online population has reached 1.1 billion, and the retail market has reached about $5.6 trillion, surpassing the United States.
此外，我国电商市场超过了1万亿美元，已经成为世界最大的电商市场。
In addition, China's electricity business market has exceeded $1 trillion, has become the world's largest market.
第二，基金募集周期拉长。
Second, the fund raising cycle is lengthened.
随着2009年量化宽松政策之后，各国资金流动性增加，2013年开始市场迎来了新的资金募集周期。
With increased liquidity in countries following quantitative easing in 2009, the market began a new funding cycle in 2013.
这一阶段很像当年美国中小银行的高速发展时期。
This period is very similar to the rapid development of small and medium-sized American banks.
当年美国中小银行创业高峰时大概有14万家中小银行，最后合并成了8000到9000家。
There were about 140,000 small and medium-sized banks at the height of the boom, eventually merging into 8,000 to 9,000.
那段时间美国政府推出了联邦保险政策，用来保护这些中小银行储户的存款。
During that time, the U.S. government introduced a federal insurance policy to protect the deposits of small and medium-sized bank depositors.
我们后来所经历的这一波众筹平台大量涌现、天使投资门槛降低、P2P、小贷的市场变化非常像那段时期的美国。
The wave of crowdfunding platforms that we have experienced since then, the lowering of the angel investment threshold, the P2P, and the small-loan market are very much like the US of that time.
但从本质上看，这一现象其实是资金流动性溢出、流动性过剩的表现。
But in essence, this phenomenon is actually a liquidity overflow, the performance of excess liquidity.
2017年，我国注册的基金规模多达3万家，但该数量在2018年开始大幅减少。
In 2017, as many as 30,000 funds were registered in the country, but that number began to decline significantly in 2018.
2018年人民币募资也基本处于停滞状态，到了2019年后半年，募资开始有一些起色，但也远不及前几年。
Renminbi also basically stagnated in 2018, by the second half of 2019, fund-raising began to show some improvement, but far less than in previous years.
但对于真正专业的早期投资人来说，现在正是一个能够更加注重长期投资的最佳时间点。
But for truly professional early-stage investors, this is the best time to focus more on long-term investments.
另外在资金募集周期方面，受到中美贸易关系影响，对于一些规模较大的资本，特别是LP是养老基金相关方向的机构，募资周期可能会受到影响。
In addition, the capital-raising cycle, which is influenced by Sino-American trade relations, may be affected for some of the larger capital groups, particularly those in which LP is the pension fund-related direction.
第三，我们正处在一个全球性的缺乏基础设施升级共识的年代。
Third, we are in an era of global consensus on infrastructure upgrading.
90年代末，互联网刚刚诞生，大家产生了一种共识：互联网是未来。
In the late 1990s, just after the advent of the Internet, a consensus emerged that the Internet was the future.
2001年互联网高点破灭，互联网社区化开始显现。
In 2001, the high point of the Internet burst, the Internet community began to appear.
2004年，Facebook成立，之后迎来了电子商务时代。
In 2004, Facebook was launched, ushering in the age of e-commerce.
后来出现了各种各样游戏和订阅服务。
Then came a variety of games and subscription services.
2007年，第一部iPhone横空出世，2014年、2015年整个移动互联网、智能手机开始普及。
In 2007, the first iPhone was born, and in 2014 and 2015 mobile Internet and smartphones became popular.
大家的共识也从互联网是未来，先后变成了“云”是未来，再到移动互联网是未来。
Everyone's consensus also from the Internet is the future, has become a "cloud" is the future, and then mobile Internet is the future.
事实上，我们现在谈论的是：物联网也是互联网中间的一部分，它是互联网的延伸。
In fact, we're talking about this: the Internet of Things is also part of the middle of the Internet, and it's an extension of the Internet.
至于互联网之后会是什么，大家其实已经没有特别清晰的共识了。
As for what will happen after the Internet, there is no particularly clear consensus.
早在2000年时我们就在谈RFID，但这项技术直到今天才慢慢落实。
We talked about RFID as early as 2000, but the technology is only slowly being implemented today.
企业软件、基础设施、核心科技当下最看好的三个创业机会无论是否有疫情的影响，以下三方面，都会是很好的创业和投资机会。
The following three business opportunities - software, infrastructure, and core technologies - are good opportunities for business start-ups and investments, whether or not they are affected by the epidemic.
第一，中小企业的企业软件。
First, enterprise software for SMEs.
但我个人觉得创业公司做协同类的软件会遇到不小的挑战，它天生是一个巨头的生意。
But I personally think it's going to be a big challenge for startups to do collaborative software. It's a giant business by nature.
钉钉和微信都是具备社交属性的P2P通讯软件，而P2P通讯软件一般是大厂做的事情。
Nails and tweets are social attributes of P2P communication software, which is generally done by large companies.
所以，为中小企业增效的软件可能更多的是在一些垂直行业，例如餐饮行业。
Therefore, the software for SMEs may be more in vertical industries, such as catering.
对标美国的餐饮业，我们的餐饮行业规模依旧很小。
Our catering industry is still very small to the standard American restaurant industry.
比如，美国一款最新的餐饮软件Toast，已经估值高达40多亿美金。
For example, Toast, a new US food and beverage software, has been valued at more than $4 billion.
但国内类似的软件估值却只有几亿美金甚至是几亿人民币。
But the domestic valuation of similar software is only a few hundred million dollars or even hundreds of millions of yuan.
究其原因，用户的使用习惯还未完全转换，例如，付费习惯、业务部署的速度等。
The reason for this is that user habits have not been fully converted, such as payment habits, the speed of business deployment, etc.
第二，基础设施。
Secondly, infrastructure.
移动互联网和物联网的快速发展，改变了很多中国企业的业态。
The rapid development of mobile Internet and Internet of Things has changed the industry of many Chinese enterprises.
招商银行最新的年报显示，手机银行、掌上生活App加起来月活高达8500多万，规模巨大。
China Merchants Bank's latest annual report shows that mobile banking, handheld life App add up to more than 85 million a month, a huge scale.
相比之下，在美国、欧洲、日本等国家，同样的金融服务软件，无论是PC端，还是移动端都远远不及中国。
By contrast, in countries such as the US, Europe, and Japan, the same financial-services software, whether on the PC or mobile side, is far below that of China.
中国的一些企业正在演变成互联网企业。
Some Chinese companies are evolving into Internet companies.
而在演变的过程中，企业往往会产生各种各样的需求，比如定位功能、身份认证功能、指纹识别和面部识别功能等。
In the process of evolution, enterprises often produce a variety of needs, such as positioning function, identity authentication function, fingerprint recognition and facial recognition function.
这些演变对于全球范围内的企业都是一个很大的趋势。
These developments are a big trend for businesses around the world.
我们的基础设施在发生变化，例如，数据库在变，很多东西的验证流程在变。
Our infrastructure is changing, for example, the database is changing, and the validation process for many things is changing.
在这些方面，中国的创新能力是非常领先的。
In these respects, China's ability to innovate is very advanced.
第三，核心科技。
Third, core technology.
例如半导体的供应链、生命科学、工业智能化、下一代通讯和航天产业等。
Examples include semiconductor supply chains, life sciences, industrial intelligence, next generation communications and aerospace industries.
一直以来，我国在类似高端制造业的投入非常有限，但也有一定优势，目前以3C为代表的全球最大企业都在我国，因此，高端制造业相应的供应链迟早都会移到国内。
China's investment in similar high-end manufacturing has been very limited, but also has certain advantages, the world's largest enterprises, such as 3C, are in China, so sooner or later, the corresponding supply chain of high-end manufacturing will move to China.
AI制药重点还是在制药熬下去很重要最近两年，大家都在关注人工智能赋能生命科学，或者医疗领域的各种可能性，在垂直领域运用人工智能更容易被人理解。
AI Pharmaceutical Focus Still Matters in Pharmaceutical Making It OK In the past two years, people have been focusing on artificial intelligence-enabled life sciences, or possibilities in the medical field, and it is easier to understand artificial intelligence in the vertical domain.
在人工智能领域里面，最早的启发者是IBM Watson。
In the field of artificial intelligence, the earliest heuristic was IBM Watson.
但在IBM Watson和MSK合作的案例之后，再未出现相当规模的大公司。
But in the case of IBM Watson and MSK, no significant companies have emerged.
事实上，Google在变成Alphabet之后，已经开始部署各种各样跟医疗和生命科学相关的子公司，从这个角度来讲，Google可能会替代IBM的角色，变成以自然语言处理和计算机视觉驱动的最领先的大公司。
In fact, Google, having become Alphabet, has started to deploy a wide range of medical and life science-related subsidiaries, and in that sense Google could replace IBM as the leading company driven by natural language processing and computer vision.
在Google之前，微软其实已经有所尝试过了。
Microsoft had already tried something before Google.
微软为了研究如何把IT技术应用到医疗领域中去，专门成立了一个Vault部门，但最后无疾而终。
Microsoft created a special Vault division to study how to apply IT technology to medicine, but it failed.
这也证明了一点，并不是越大的公司在做医疗领域就越有优势。
It also proves that not the bigger the company, the better off it is in health care.
在这个领域最成功的案例，是一家坐落于美国纽约的创业公司，名叫“铁熨斗“（Flatiron Health），前几年这家公司以19亿美金的价格卖给了罗氏。
The most successful case in this area is Flatiron Health, a New York-based start-up that was sold to Roche for $1.9 billion a year earlier.
在2014年到2015年这段时间，很多创业者尝试在“铁熨斗”的相关领域创业，试图做出一些辅助读片来帮助医生。
Between 2014 and 2015, many entrepreneurs are trying to start their own businesses in areas related to iron irons, trying to help doctors with auxiliary readouts.
但当时的“铁熨斗”，已经从根本上替代了医生很多读片工作。
But the iron irons of the time had taken a fundamental place in the work of many doctors reading films.
当时，中国还有很多人追着Google的肺小结节比赛的数据来做创业。
At the time, there were plenty of Chinese startups chasing Google's pulmonary nodules.
但美国和中国的医疗生态不太一样，到最后大多人发现这些从美国照抄回来的创业方向，不太适合中国。
But the U. S. and China's medical ecology is not the same, and by the end most people found that the directions copied from the United States were not suitable for China.
首先，AI不能替代医生。
First, AI is no substitute for doctors.
其次，企业需要克服很多监管和商业方面的因素。
Second, companies need to overcome many regulatory and commercial factors.
所以，在经历了AI和生命科学、医疗方面交叉领域的变化之后，我们将目光聚焦到了人工智能制药领域。
So, having undergone changes in AI and the cross-cutting areas of life sciences and medicine, we are turning our attention to artificial intelligence pharmaceuticals.
在这个领域近年出了两家上市公司，薛定谔（NASDAQ:SDGR)和黑钻(NASDAQ:BDTX)。
There have been two publicly traded companies in this area in recent years, Schrodinger (NASDAQ: SDGR) and the Black Diamond (NASDAQ: BDTX).
这两家公司让很多人看到了机会。
The two companies offer opportunities to many people.
通常，一个药的研发大概需要10亿美元、10年时间，在AI的帮助下，或许能将这个时间大大缩短。
Typically, a drug takes about $1 billion, or 10 years, to develop, and with AI's help, it might be possible to shorten that time considerably.
但从另一方面来看，AI制药并不是一个比较火的市场，在这个领域创业需要熬时间。
But AI pharmaceuticals, on the other hand, is not a popular market, and it takes time to start a business in this area.
像薛定谔这样的已经创业30年的公司，在2018年，全公司的收入也才达到6000万美金，此外，因为缺少资金和精力，公司还有25个项目只能靠合作完成。
Schrodinger's 30-year-old company earned only $60 million in 2018, and because of lack of capital and energy, it had 25 other projects to work on.
相比之下，黑钻发展要快一些，成立不到六年的时间就上市了，但目前为止也只做出了两个临床前的药物。
Black drilling, by contrast, is growing faster, having been on the market in less than six years, but has so far produced only two pre-clinical drugs.
所以AI技术到底能不能达到大家期望的结果，整个行业目前还在观望中。
So AI technology can achieve the desired results, the entire industry is still waiting to see.
对于创业者来说，是否能够坚持下去，也是一项挑战。
It is also a challenge for entrepreneurs to stay the course.
但用人工智能帮助新药研发早已不是新话题了。
But using artificial intelligence to help develop new drugs is no longer a new topic.
早在1981年10月，Fortune财富杂志的封面就已经报道过一则新闻，默克在用计算机开始做计算，帮助提升新药研发的效率。
Back in October 1981, Fortune magazine ran a story on its cover, and Merck began using computers to do calculations to help improve the efficiency of new drug development.
但尽管如此，目前还没有任何一款由AI成功研发的药物上市。
Despite this, none of the AI-developed drugs are currently on the market.
2017年，Nature杂志上一篇名为《制药者银河旅行手册》的文献指出，全球可合成的分子数量潜力大概在10的60次方，而目前我们的IPv6也只能达到10的32次方，所以，尽管相比1981年，我们算力有了很大提升，但仍然是不够的。
In 2017, a paper in Nature entitled "Galactic Travel Manual for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers" noted that the global potential for the number of synthetic molecules is about 60 times greater than 10, and that our IPv6 currently has only 32 doses, so that, while we are much better off than we were in 1981, it is still not enough.
我们访谈过很多科学家，他们认为从0到1的过程，AI确实能有一定的帮助，因为它的速度非常快；但是从1到10，从10到100的过程，则需要介入一些人力的干扰，例如，化学家和生物学家的帮助。
We interviewed a lot of scientists who think that AI can really be helpful from 0 to 1 because it can be very fast, but from 1 to 10, from 10 to 100, some human intervention is needed, for example, with the help of chemists and biologists.
所以从整个领域来看，虽然大家期待在AI帮助下，计算化学能够变成新药研发领域的"Excel", 通过算力来提升我们的设计能力。
So across the board, computing chemistry is expected to turn into a new drug with AI's help; Excel & quot; to boost our design capabilities by doing the math.
但事实证明，AI制药的重点还是在制药。
But AI's focus has proven to be on pharmaceuticals.
对于制药公司来说，公司最终的价值取决于新药的流水线，临床前的条件和靶点的选择等条件。
For pharmaceutical companies, the ultimate value of a company depends on the pipeline of new drugs, pre-clinical conditions and the choice of targets.
因此，从创业的角度，我们认为从制药领域上下游和周边切入，会比较有优势。
Therefore, from the perspective of entrepreneurship, we think that from the pharmaceutical field upstream and downstream and the surrounding cut, will be more advantageous.
因为，大公司往往不会做新药研发，如果创业公司既有AI能力，同时又理解制药行业，将会有很大的机会。
Because big companies tend not to develop new drugs, startups with AI capabilities and an understanding of the pharmaceutical industry stand a good chance.
目前这个市场虽然有200多家公司，但大部分都不是中国的公司，这些公司中有类似旷视这样的综合性AI公司，但还有更多一些是垂直领域的AI公司。
There are more than 200 companies in the market, but most of them are not Chinese companies. There are AI companies like Absenteeism, but there are more AI companies in the vertical field.
这是个不会被巨头打扰到的领域，但由于这个领域的发展大趋势是跟制药相关的，所以公司能否发展起来，还要取决于创业者是否能熬得住。
It's an area not to be bothered by giants, but since the big trends in this area are related to pharmaceuticals, the success of a company depends on whether the entrepreneur can survive.
事实上，中国在AI领域，在全球范围内都非常有竞争力。
In fact, China is very competitive globally in the AI field.
我们的算法工程师数理化比较占优势，这意味着很多年轻人都能在AI这条路上走很远。
Our algorithm engineers have a comparative advantage in math and chemistry, which means that many young people can walk a long way down AI's path.
所以目前，我认为在中国很多相关的创业者都希望能够抓住这次机会，借助人工智能的帮助，赶超欧美和日本新药研发的速度。
So right now, I think a lot of interested entrepreneurs in China want to seize this opportunity to catch up with the development of new drugs in Europe, America and Japan with the help of artificial intelligence.
对话熊伟铭：对于投资机构的挑战是募资今年整个创投会很慢燃财经：疫情之下，华创资本投资的哪些项目受到了比较明显的影响，哪些反而迎来了增长机会？你从项目那里听到的最多的困难是什么？对于身处困境的项目，你会给出什么建议？熊伟铭：我们所有涉及到线下交付的业务都受到影响，但很多电商相关的项目，流量却有很大增长，所以对我们来说是福祸参半。
Dialogue Weiming Xiong: The challenge for investment institutions is to raise capital The whole venture this year will be slow-moving financially: Which of the projects that Huachuan Capital invests in has had a more obvious impact on growth opportunities? What are the most difficult things you hear from the program?
迎来增长机会的是一些会涉及到线下场景的项目，我们有一个公司叫下厨房，由于疫情发生，大家都开始在家做饭了，给他们增加了很多新用户，服务器都被挤爆了，这是疫情带来的想不到的贡献。
There are projects that involve off-line scenarios. We have a company called Kitchen, and because of the epidemic, people are cooking at home, adding a lot of new users and bursting servers, which is an unexpected contribution to the epidemic.
对于企业最大的困难，肯定还是在疫情下如何保证现金流。
To the enterprise biggest difficulty, is certainly in the epidemic situation how guarantees the cash flow.
很多企业的融资节奏是比较保守型的，受疫情影响，相当于停掉三到四个月的现金流。
The pace of funding for many companies is conservative, affected by the epidemic, equivalent to three to four months of cash flow suspension.
如果悲观估计，很可能半年内都没有现金流流入。
If pessimistic estimates, it is likely that there will be no cash flow for six months.
这种情况下，创业者可能需要做调整，如果企业钱太少了，来不及转身或者改变，不如减产和和休眠，如果企业还有一部分资金，能够支撑七八个月，可以做一些新的尝试。
In such cases, the entrepreneur may need to adjust, and if the business has too little money to turn around or change, it might as well cut back and go to sleep. If the company has some money to last for seven or eight months, it can try something new.
燃财经：你在华创主导技术领域的投资，已投项目涉及民营航空、自动驾驶等，对于技术类项目的投资，你更关注哪些维度，你的底层思考逻辑是什么？疫情之后，这个方向上的投资策略会否发生变化？熊伟铭：在前沿科技里，如果刨除生命科学，其实我们的主题很明确。
Flaming Finance: Your investment in the leading technology sector in Huacheng has already involved private aviation, auto-driving, etc. What dimensions do you focus on for investment in technical projects, and what is your bottom-line thinking logic? Will the investment strategy in this direction change after the outbreak?
因为生命科学是一个非常专业的领域，把它作为一个行业来考虑，它和医疗健康、金融是同等规模的万亿级别的支柱型产业。
Because life science is a very specialized field, considering it as an industry, it is a trillion-dollar industry on the same scale as health care and finance.
我们的两大主题，一个主题是围绕中国引领世界的一些领域，比如商业航天领域。
One of our two main themes revolves around China leading the world in areas such as commercial space.
其实在商业航天领域，中国在技术上非常领先，只不过因为Space X和Blue Origin这样的公司出现，导致在民营领域我们暂时落后。
In fact, China is very technologically advanced in the field of commercial space, only because companies like Space X and Blue Origin have emerged, leaving us temporarily behind in the private sector.
比如AI领域，我认为中国基于AI数学算力方面的人才输入非常有优势。
In AI, for example, I think China has an advantage in AI-based computing.
再者，在一些细分领域里，例如计算科学，处于算力驱动领域，计算机科学有着各种各样的机会。
Moreover, in some areas of segmentation, such as computational science, which is driven by computing power, there are a variety of opportunities for computer science.
另一大主题是以通讯为基础的领域。
Another major theme is communication-based areas.
中国的通讯其实传统上讲是比较弱的，中国从来都是一个下游的供应链的整合商，因此我们无论是做基站，还是做个人通讯设备，其实产出的往往是最终产品。
Communication in China has traditionally been weak, and China has always been a downstream integrator of the supply chain, so whether we do base station or personal communications equipment, it is often the final product that is produced.
但也正因为最终产品在中国制造，所以我们在上游的组件能力也在提升。
But just because the final product is made in China, our upstream component capabilities are also improving.
例如，最近半导体行业，这一大波浪潮已经持续了两年时间。
In the semiconductor industry, for example, the recent wave has lasted for two years.
所以我们认为中国通讯有很大的机会能够带起中国的半导体。
So we think there's a good chance that China Communications will be able to bring up Chinese semiconductors.
燃财经：疫情带给投资机构新的挑战有哪些，华创资本如何应对？你对2020年的创投热点赛道有什么判断？熊伟铭：对于投资机构的挑战，其实是募资。
Flaming Finance: What are the new challenges that the epidemic brings to investment institutions, and how will Chungchung Capital deal with them? What is your judgment about the 2020 VCs? Xiong Weiming: The challenge for investment institutions is really fundraising.
因为投资可快可慢，你肯定会错过。
Because investment can be quick or slow, you are bound to miss it.
我觉得错过项目不是最可怕的，关键还是募资要有自己的节奏。
I don't think missing out on projects is the most frightening thing. The key is to raise money at your own pace.
之前，整个中国的投资行业已经遇到了2018年的断粮，在人民币供应方面现在正在逐步恢复，但这个其实不是制度性的恢复，而是政策性的恢复，这一点其实是中国市场最大的挑战。
China's investment industry, which had already suffered a 2018 food shortage, is now recovering in terms of renminbi supply, but this is not an institutional recovery, but a policy recovery, which is actually the biggest challenge for the Chinese market.
在这种情况下，募资绝对要有自己的节奏。
In this case, fund-raising absolutely must have its own rhythm.
我们很幸运，在2018年就做完了募资，所以到现在我们还在投资18年募集的资金。
We're lucky to have done our fundraising in 2018, so we're still investing 18 years of fundraising.
去年大概做了20多个项目，对我们来讲速度已经是之前的一半，我觉得今年整个创投业务会更慢，可能整体加起来只有六、七个项目。
Last year we did about 20 projects, half the speed for us, and I think the overall venture will be slower this year, maybe only six or seven projects taken together.
2020年，我们还是会关注核心科技、前沿科技和企业IT，持续在这个市场积极推进。
In 2020, we will remain focused on core technologies, cutting-edge technology and corporate IT, and continue to push aggressively in this market.
每个新领域的出现都会有所谓泡沫燃财经：最近两年，AI行业的发展速度并没有跟上外界的预期，“AI泡沫破灭论”甚嚣尘上，你怎么看待这个现实？你认为AI企业应该如何应对目前的挑战？熊伟铭：AI的发展其实远远没有达到外界预期。
What do you think of the fact that the AI industry has not kept pace with expectations in the last two years, and that the AI bubble has burst? How do you think AI companies should respond to current challenges?
在我们这个圈里，你说AI泡沫破灭也对。
In our circle, you're right to say that AI bubbles burst.
我记得当年百度在招无人驾驶和AI人才时，只要你愿意从硅谷回到中国，同样级别的员工，工资就会涨15%，那个时候实际上是有点所谓的泡沫。
I remember when Baidu was recruiting talent for drones and AI, when you were willing to return to China from Silicon Valley, wages rose by 15% for the same level of employees, which was actually a bit of a bubble.
但就像卡布奇诺如果没有泡沫，它也不好喝。
But just like cappuccino without bubbles, it is not easy to drink.
所以泡沫还是有作用的，它让一些原来创业成本或者是移动成本很高的人才，更愿意移动到中国来，加入中国的创业公司或者大公司，现在AI领域的人才越来越多了。
So the bubble is still working, because it makes some people who used to have high start-up costs or high mobile costs prefer to move to China to join Chinese startups or big companies, and AI is becoming more and more talented.
这有点像在2000年，那个时候没有软件人才。
It was a bit like 2000, when there was no software talent.
从中国大学计算机系毕业的同学们，根本就做不了直接的商业软件，当时对于个人和企业来讲，都很难。
Graduates of computer science from Chinese universities were unable to do direct business software at all, which was difficult for individuals and businesses at the time.
所以那个时候也同样出现过软件热潮，由此也带来了一阵软件人才泡沫。
So, too, there was a software boom, which led to a software talent bubble.
每有一个新的领域出现，我们都会发现相关的人才培养还有很长的路要走。
Every time a new field emerges, we will find that there is still a long way to go for the relevant talents to be developed.
燃财经：在抗击疫情的过程中，有一些AI相关的应用比较亮眼，这里面你最关注的是哪些？疫情之下短期爆发的需求在未来能否持续？疫情之后可以重点关注哪些AI相关的赛道？AI公司应该从疫情里学到哪些东西？熊伟铭：我们有一些AI和零售公司，很早发现了一些现象。
What are some of the AI-related applications that you're most concerned about in the fight against the epidemic? Is the short-term outbreak of demand sustainable in the future? What AI-related tracks can focus on after the outbreak? What should AI learn from the epidemic? Xiong Weiming: We have some AI and retail companies that have discovered something early.
首先，我们发现确定客户需要跟身份证挂钩，于是我们想能不能做一个戴口罩仍然能识别身份的技术。
First, we found out that customers needed to be hooked to their ID cards, so we wondered if we could make a face mask that would still identify us.
爱笔智能（Aibee）做了一个技术，有了这项技术，无论是在停车场还是在商场里，即使戴着口罩仍然能够完成面部识别。
Aibee has developed a technology that allows face recognition even in parking lots and shopping malls.
其次，我们想到了身份识别，现在大家更重视身份识别要和体征挂在一起，比如，你的体温在今天下午3点半是多少度，当你出现在商场时，你的温度是多少？这个时候，我们把原来所说的消费者购物环境情景重现，改变成了体征变化情景重现，以此我们可以判断该用户是否是潜在患者。
Second, we've come up with the idea of identity recognition, which now places more emphasis on identification and signs, such as how much your body temperature is at 3: 30 this afternoon, and how warm you are when you appear at the mall.
这些都是在疫情期间，利用AI或者自动化或者互联网整体能够帮到线下的地方。
These are places where AI or automation or the Internet as a whole can help out during an epidemic.
我觉得此次疫情对AI赛道的影响不太大。
I don't think this epidemic will have much impact on AI.
线上是最好的诉求自动驾驶是未来趋势燃财经：2003年SARS时，你在做什么？现在的感受和当时有哪些不同？疫情之后，什么行业的爆发路径可以参考当年SARS？熊伟铭：2003年，我在做蓝牙方面的创业，2000年我们就在看物联网，但当时太早期了。
Online is the Best Demand Auto Driving is FutureFlaming Finance: What did you do with SARS in 2003? How did you feel and what was different? After the outbreak, what was the route of the outbreak? Xiong Weiming: In 2003, I started a business with Bluetooth.
2004年，我在做互联网的研究覆盖，主要是对新浪、搜狐、网易三大公司。
In 2004, I was doing Internet research coverage, mainly to Sina, Sohu, Netease three companies.
当时很多公司还没上市，感觉整体经济会慢很多。
Many companies had not yet gone public and felt the overall economy would be much slower.
当时也没有电商，区域性更明显，只有北京和广州近乎于封城的状态，但还是可以自由上街的。
There was no electricity business, the region was more obvious, only Beijing and Guangzhou near the status of a closed city, but still free to go to the street.
在2003年之后，2004年又遇到了禽流感，连着两年的公共卫生事件都非常有挑战性。
After 2003, the year 2004 was again marked by avian influenza, and two years of public health events were very challenging.
但我也明显感觉到，2004年像一个起步，那一年中国其实整体经济不太好，大家在评估中国公司时都要打个折扣，那时候我们评估一个大的投资人要想投网易，提到用16%的China discount（中国折扣）。
But I also have a strong sense that 2004 was like a start, when China's overall economy was really not doing well, and you had to discount when you evaluate Chinese companies, when we evaluated a big investor who wanted to invest in Netease, referring to a 16% discount for China.
但2005年迎来了一个非常明显的转变，中国突然变成了金砖四国中间的C，从此变成了一个有溢价的市场，投资中国的热情全都上来了。
But 2005 ushered in a remarkable shift, with China suddenly becoming the C among the BRIC countries, and thus a premium market, with all the enthusiasm for investing in China.
2003年之后，以阿里巴巴为代表的电商慢慢发展起来了，当时电商还是非常原始的，那个时候的淘宝其实和今天的拼多多差不多，网民的平均年龄大概二十五六岁，大家也没有什么钱。
After 2003, Alibaba as the representative of the electric business slowly developed, then very primitive, then Taobao and today's shopping more or less the same, the average age of the Internet users about 25 or 16, and there is no money.
所以在电商发展中间，总是存在一些代际和区域上的特征。
Therefore, in the development of electronic commerce, there are always some intergenerational and regional characteristics.
而阿里巴巴从2005年估值20亿美金，到今天的5000亿美金，这中间也是个非常大的增长。
And Alibaba's valuation from $2 billion in 2005 to $500 billion today is a very big increase.
所以我认为在整个领域里，线上是最好的诉求。
So I think in the whole field, online is the best appeal.
燃财经：前几年有一股自动驾驶的创业投资热潮，但是几大明星创业公司的业务进展都比较缓慢，甚至出现了很多棘手的问题。
Flaming Finance: A few years ago there was a boom in auto-driving startups, but the big startups were slow to make headway and even had a lot of tough problems.
你认为未来5年内，自动驾驶行业能否有大的突破？目前的瓶颈在哪里？未来什么类型的玩家更有机会？熊伟铭：前两天，我们看到小马拿到4亿美金丰田的投资，我觉得这对行业是一个强心针。
Do you think there will be any major breakthroughs in the auto-driving industry in the next five years? Where are the current bottlenecks? What kind of future players will have a better chance? Xiong Weiming: The last two days, we saw a $400 million Toyota investment in a colt, and I think it's a big shot in the industry.
中国的自动驾驶一直处在第二梯队的状态，值得注意的是，美国的商业大公司在自动驾驶领域里的动作，其实是不弱于谷歌这样的互联网公司的。
Auto-driving in China has always been in the second echelon, and it is worth noting that the actions of big US businesses in the field of auto-driving are no less powerful than those of internet companies like Google.
通过观察福特和通用的投资方向，会发现他们在无人驾驶方面，各自的投入也都非常大。
By looking at the direction Ford and GM are investing, they are also investing heavily in unmanned systems.
但在自动驾驶这个领域，中国的主机厂的投入还比较少，面临很大的挑战。
However, in the field of automatic driving, China's main plant is still relatively small investment, facing a great challenge.
从历史上看，中国最早的民用汽车厂，是在1985年，由上汽和大众合资建成。
Historically, China's first civilian car factory was built in 1985 as a joint venture between SAIC and Volkswagen.
从刚开始的默默无闻到90年代中后期有了金融的支持，我国的个人汽车逐步发展成一个大行业，今天中国已经成为最大的新车市场。
From obscurity at the beginning to financial support in the mid to late 1990s, our personal cars have gradually developed into a large industry, and today China has become the largest market for new cars.
其实中国的主机厂一路都是在上升，目前还未曾经历过像美国一样大规模的合并。
In fact, China's main engine plant all the way up, has not experienced the same large-scale merger as the United States.
在美国，自动驾驶经历了从1903年创办的福特到特斯拉的进化演变，而在中国，无人驾驶相当于要从水里游的鱼迅速变成地上行走的人，这中间的挑战是非常大的。
In the United States, automatic driving has evolved from Ford in 1903 to Tesla, and in China, driverless people are the equivalent of moving fish out of water into people walking on the ground.
另外，电动车也是另一个挑战。
Electric cars are another challenge.
在电动车里面有很多值得期待的一些变化，不过电动车这些鲶鱼很可能反过来刺激主机厂，让他们变得更接近时代的前沿。
There are plenty of changes to look forward to in electric cars, but the catfish are likely to turn them around and bring them closer to the forefront of the times.
未来我认为无论是把它做成L3、L4放置在自己的车上，还是到最后自动驾驶会变成一个车队，成为一种公共服务设施，自动驾驶肯定是整个汽车行业中间必不可少的一部分。
In the future, I think whether we make it into L3, L4 in our own car, or whether it turns into a motorcade, a public service facility, automatic driving is definitely an essential part of the car industry.
现在国内的主机厂在自动驾驶领域里并没有大手笔的投入。
There is no big investment in the field of auto-driving at home now.
但我认为如果现在不投入的话，未来可能连门票都没有了。
But I think if I don't put in now, there may not even be tickets left in the future.
我觉得可以参考小米手机对于整个手机链的冲击，这一波电动车加上自动驾驶可能会对中国主机厂产生一定的冲击。
I think you can refer to the impact of millet mobile phone on the entire chain, this wave of electric cars plus automatic driving may have a certain impact on China's main plant.
