对疫情一线的医护人员而言，理发是一项迫切的需求。
Hairdressing is an urgent need for frontline health care workers.
头发太长，工作不方便，穿着防护服全身汗湿，还有沾染病毒的风险。
Hair is too long, work is not convenient, wear protective clothing sweaty all over the body, there is also a risk of virus contamination.
接到来自医院的需求，一些理发师从武汉的各个角落出发，到医院或是医疗队驻扎的酒店，免费为医护人员理发。
In response to requests from hospitals, some hairdressers travel from every corner of Wuhan to hospitals or medical team hotels to have their hair cut for free.
在每人十几分钟的理发时间里，理发师听着医护人员自己的故事。
During each person's ten-minute haircut, the barber listened to the paramedics' own stories.
疫情和家庭是常见的话题，理发师听医生谈过重症病例的遗憾，也见过护士聊起孩子时通红的双眼。
The epidemic and the family are common topics, with barbers listening to doctors talk about the regret of serious cases and nurses talking about the red eyes of their children.
有位理发师在日记本上写，“在边剪边聊的过程中，发觉她们都是平凡而伟大的人。
One hairdresser wrote in his diary that while cutting and chatting, he found that they were all ordinary and great people.
”他心想，一定要让每个人都漂漂亮亮地回家。
"Everyone," he thought, "must be brought home beautifully.
···············除夕夜，封城后的武汉街道行人寥寥。
................................................ New Year's Eve, behind closes the city the street pedestrian few.
甘书爽独自开车回郊区老家，边开车边流泪。
Gan ShuShuang driving back to his hometown alone, while driving tears.
他刚刚结束工作，把病人从发热门诊扶到病房。
He had just finished work and moved the patient from the fever clinic to the ward.
诊室里人挤着人，有人站着打吊瓶，有人躺倒在地，几个护士跑前跑后，配药，换药，打针。
The room was crowded with people, people standing and hanging bottles, people lying on the floor, nurses running and running, dispensing medicine, changing medicine, giving injections.
烟味、汗味混杂着消毒水味蔓延开来，甘书爽的护目镜上糊了一层水雾，他低着头，看不大真切，只能听见哭喊，“怎么这么慢啊”“护士怎么还不来啊”。
The smell of smoke and sweat spread through the disinfectant, and the pleasant goggles were covered with a mist. He bowed his head, looked not so real, and could only hear the cry, "Why is it so slow" "Nurse has not come yet."
甘书爽是一名救护车司机，开一天车休两天，闲时和妻子在小区开了家理发店。
Kan ShuShuang is an ambulance driver, driving a two-day car break, free time and his wife opened a barber shop in the community.
医院不放假，除夕夜和家人小聚后，甘书爽又独自开车回市区工作，妻子和孩子留在老家过年。
Hospitals do not have holidays, New Year's Eve and family after the small gatherings, Gansu Shuang drove back to work alone, his wife and children stay at home for the New Year.
理发店不开门，休息那两天，他一个人闷在房间里，打两局王者荣耀，觉得没意思，放下手机，又忍不住想疫情的事。
The barber shop did not open the door, and during the two days of rest he was alone in his room, glorified and bored by the two games, put down his cell phone and couldn't help thinking about the epidemic.
1月31号晚上，他刷朋友圈，看见有人招志愿者给医护人员理发，没想太多，在底下留了句“我可以啊”。
On the night of Jan. 31, he brushed his circle of friends and saw volunteers trying to get their doctors and nurses to cut their hair.
那几日，武汉城里不少理发师都接到了医院打来的电话：医护们头发太长，戴防护帽头发露出来，有交叉感染的风险，能不能来帮我们理个发？一位负责对接理发需求的志愿者称，每天要收到5、6个医疗队的理发需求。
A few days ago, a number of barbers in Wuhan received phone calls from the hospital: The doctors and nurses have long hair, wear protective headgear, and are at risk of cross-infection.
援汉医疗队有上万人，能出动的理发师志愿者只有三四十人，“人手是大问题”。
There are tens of thousands of people in the medical team and only thirty or forty barber volunteers can be dispatched.
理发师沈杰说，医生是从高德地图上搜到他的联系方式。
Hairdresser Shen Jie said the doctor found his contact information on the map of Goethe.
电话里，医生告诉他，已经被十多个理发师拒绝过了。
On the phone, the doctor told him that he had been turned down by a dozen hairdressers.
甘书爽在去剪发的路上刚和朋友说好，甘书爽就有点后悔了。
Gansu Shuang in the hair cut on the road and just said good friends, Gansu Shuang on a bit regret.
他给妻子发微信商量，妻子态度坚决，“不许去”，万一感染上病毒怎么办？他回，好的，不去。
He wrote to his wife to discuss, his wife resolute attitude, "do not go," in case of infection with the virus? He back, OK, not.
那天晚上，甘书爽经历了漫长的心理斗争，他想找理由推脱，“跟志愿者说每天要上班，没有时间去”。
That night, Gan ShuShuang experienced a long psychological struggle, he wanted to find reasons to escape, "told volunteers to work every day, no time to go."
想来想去，又不安心，觉得答应了别人的事不好不去。
Thinking and thinking, but not at ease, that it is not good to agree to other people's things.
在医院工作，他熟悉穿防护服的感觉，“太难受了”。
Working in the hospital, he was familiar with the feeling of wearing protective clothing, "too bad."
防护服密闭性强，热散不出去，人捂在里面很快全身汗湿。
Protective clothing close, heat can not go out, people covered in the body quickly sweating wet.
头发更难处理，碎发露出来，病毒很可能通过患者的飞沫沾到头发上。
Hair is more difficult to handle, and shredded hair is exposed and the virus is likely to stick to the hair through the patient's droplets.
甘书爽的医护朋友们都在一线，“他们生命都不顾，去抢救病人，剪头发我要是往后退了，感觉自己太胆小了吧。
The eager health-care friends are on the line. "They're all dead, save the sick, cut my hair. I feel too timid if I step back.
”甘书爽没再找妻子说剪发的事，第二天早上八点，他装上剪刀、梳子、夹子、电推、围布、吹风机，坐车前往上海医疗队所在的酒店。
At eight o'clock the next morning he put on scissors, a comb, a clip, an electric push, a cloth and a hair dryer, and drove to the hotel where the Shanghai medical team was staying.
酒店新贴了招牌，粉底黑字写着“上海医疗队辛苦了”“武汉人民感谢您”。
The hotel has put up a new sign, in black and pink: "Shanghai Medical Team has worked hard" "Wuhan people thank you.
大堂里已经站了不少人，手里拿着号码牌，从1号排到50号，都是等着剪头发的。
A number of people were already standing in the lobby, with number plates in their hands, from the 1st to the 50th, waiting for their hair to be cut.
时间紧，发型没法像平时那样做得精细，洗头、吹头的工序都省了。
Time is tight, the hairstyle can not do as usual fine, shampoo, blow-hair procedures have been saved.
像甘书爽这样的理发师志愿者不在少数。
There are plenty of barber volunteers like Gan Shuang.
理发师刘宽的剪发地点在医院体检中心，医生们腾挪出一小块空地，没有镜子，窗户前面摞着装物资的纸盒。
Hairdresser Liu Kuan's haircut took place at the hospital's medical center, where doctors vacated a small space with no mirrors and paper boxes stacked in front of windows.
刘宽的防护服没一会儿就汗湿透了，护目镜的镜架粘在脸上，镜片起雾，看不清楚，只能凭感觉剪。
Liu Kuan's suit was soaking wet in a few minutes, the goggles were glued to his face, the lenses fogged up and could only be cut by feeling.
医护人员的要求很简单，要短发，头发垂下来不能超过脖子，两鬓、后颈不能有碎发，刘海也要剃掉。
The request of medical personnel is very simple, want short hair, hair hanging down cannot exceed neck, temples, back neck cannot have broken hair, Liu Hai also wants shaving off.
“能戴防护帽”“好打理”是第一位的，其次才是“好看”。
"Wear protective headgear" "easy to manage" is the first, followed by "good-looking."
有的姑娘爱美，会叮嘱“剪漂亮点”，也有人主动要求剃光头，想着“洗头比较方便”。
Some girls love beauty, will ask "cut beautiful point," others take the initiative to shave their heads, think of "more convenient shampoo."
遇到这样的，理发师宋忠桥会劝她们留点头发，“剃了反而是个坏事，没有头发卡住，戴防护帽反而不容易了”。
Under such circumstances, the barber Song Zhongqiao will advise them to save some hair, "shaving is a bad thing, no hair stuck, wearing a helmet is not easy."
一些人的头发有剪过的痕迹，把头发拨开，后颈一片红，密密麻麻都是血点子。
Some had had their hair cut, their hair pushed open, their necks red and thick with ideas of blood.
一问才知道，以前找不到理发师，为了不露头发，有人用修眉刀刮，还有人用手一根根拔。
Ask just know, before cannot find hairdresser, in order not to expose hair, someone with eyebrow razor, others with a hand root pull.
宋忠桥看着难受，他开玩笑，“你们现在找了个专业理发师，以后就别做理发师的工作了”。
Song Zhongqiao looked afflictive, he joked. "Now you've got a professional hairdresser. Don't work as a hairdresser any more."
理发师们套上防护服、护目镜、口罩、手套，梳子、剪子、推子也要先放酒精里消毒。
Hairdressers wear protective clothing, goggles, masks, gloves, combs, scissors, and pushers.
防护手套穿过纤长的发丝，不少还留着刚烫染过的痕迹。
Protective gloves pass through long, slender hair, many of which still bear the marks of fresh ironing.
挑起一缕，剪刀在顶上比划，“确定要这么短吗？”   。
Pick up a wisp of scissors at the top of the row, "sure it's so short?"
看着别人剪头发，拿着2号牌的护士抽抽搭搭地哭了。
Watching other people cut their hair, the nurse with number two began to cry.
甘书爽猜想，可能是舍不得头发吧。
Gansu Shuang guess, may be reluctant to hair it.
有人把她拉到一边，甘书爽没听清说了什么。
Someone pulled her aside and it was too pleasant to hear what she said.
回来坐上椅子，女孩不哭了，说要剪一个男式头。
Back in the chair, the girl did not cry, said to cut a man's head.
“咔擦”，齐肩长发应声而落。
"Grease", shoulder-length hair answered.
宋忠桥记得一个女孩，二十七八岁的样子，语气轻快，“师傅帮我剪好看点，我要去相亲的！”父母给她找好了相亲对象，本打算春节见面，疫情一来，什么都没顾上。
Song Zhongqiao remembered a girl, twenty-eight years old, tone of light, "Shifu help me cut better, I will go blind date!" Her parents gave her a good blind date, intended to meet the Spring Festival, the outbreak of nothing.
宋忠桥笑着应，但最后没办法，还是得推掉两鬓和后颈的头发，他只好对女孩说，等疫情过去，你的头发也该长起来了。
Song Zhongqiao smiled, but finally no way, or pushed off the temples and back neck of the hair, he had to say to the girl, after the epidemic, your hair should grow up.
疫情是绕不开的话题。
The epidemic is an unavoidable topic.
刘宽总会问起，现在情况怎么样，疫情还要多久才会结束？没人能给一个确切的答案。
Liu Kuan always asks how the situation is, how long will the epidemic end? No one can give a definitive answer.
谈及重症病例，医生们面色凝重，有个养老院送来的老人，各项检查都显示已感染，老人硬是不承认，待在医院不吃不喝。
When it came to serious cases, the doctors were grave, there was an old man from a nursing home who, after all the tests showed signs of infection, refused to admit it and stayed in the hospital without food or drink.
刘宽问，家人不来看吗？医生摇摇头，“不清楚”。
Liu Hwan asked, family do not come to see it? The doctor shook his head, "not clear."
医生又说，老年人感染肺炎最危险，一旦引发并发症，人说走就走了。
Doctors say pneumonia is the most dangerous infection in the elderly, and once complications arise, people walk away.
刘宽问，你们每天在一线工作，家人不担心吗？医生说，哪有不担心呢，每天都打电话。
Liu Hwan asked, do you work on the front line every day, and don't your family worry? The doctor said, "Why not worry? Call every day."
有护士理发时跟家里人视频通话，家人在电话那头笑，医院还有发型师呢，刘宽从椅子后面探出半个头，“嗨”。
When a nurse had a haircut, he talked to his family on the phone, his family laughed on the phone, the hospital had a stylist, and Liu Kuan leaned half his head out of the back of the chair.
护士的孩子看起来不到一岁，还不会说话，视频看见妈妈，咯咯地笑起来。
The nurse's child, who looked less than a year old and could not speak, giggled at the sight of her mother.
护士也笑了：“你一定要听爸爸的话哦，妈妈忙完这段时间就回去陪你们。
"The nurse smiled," You must listen to Dad. Mom is busy with this time, so she can go back with you.
”宋忠桥有写日记的习惯，每天都要在本子上记一笔，今天又去给哪里的医疗队剪了头发，剪了多少人，又听到什么故事。
Song Zhongqiao was in the habit of keeping a diary, and he wrote a note in his notebook every day, and today he went to the medical team where he had his hair cut, how many people he had cut and what stories he heard.
从大年初三开始，他已经为13个医疗队剪过发，平均每个医疗队30多人，他要从早上九点忙到下午四点。
Since the New Year's Day, he has cut 13 medical teams, an average of more than 30 people per medical team, he is busy from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
宋忠桥日记，“在边剪边聊的过程中，发觉她们都是平凡而伟大的人”。
"Song Zhongqiao diary," while cutting and chatting, found that they are all ordinary and great people. "
最开始剪发，宋忠桥总要问一句，家里人同不同意来。
At the beginning of the haircut, Song Zhongqiao always asked, the family and do not agree to come.
陕西医疗队的一位护士说，家里人都支持，只有孩子不同意，哭着闹着要妈妈留下来过春节。
A nurse from the Shaanxi Medical Team said that all the family support, only the children do not agree, crying to ask their mother to stay for the Spring Festival.
护士说，妈妈要去前方打怪兽，怪兽打完了就回来陪你玩，孩子哭着说“好”。
The nurse says, mother is going to hit monster ahead, monster hit back to play with you, the child cried and said "good."
护士讲这段故事时，声音发颤，眼圈发红，眼泪看着就要掉下来，宋忠桥赶紧安慰她，“希望疫情快点过去，你们一家人能早点团聚”。
As the nurse told the story, her voice trembled, her eyes flushed, tears began to fall. Song Zhongqiao comforted her.
后来，宋忠桥就不忍心聊家庭了。
Later, Song Zhongqiao could not bear to talk about family.
讲到家庭总有人哭，说着说着就红了眼。
When it comes to family crying, people blush at the sound of it.
宋忠桥把剪掉的头发留下来，每次剪好了，医护们还要手拿一缕头发拍张照，发给家人。
Song Zhongqiao cut the hair to stay, each time cut, the medical staff also took a wisp of hair to take a photo, to be distributed to the family.
他承诺，等疫情结束，就邀请医疗队到他店里，免费设计发型，让每个人都漂漂亮亮地回家。
He promised to invite the medical team to his store when the outbreak was over, and to design the hairstyle for free, so that everyone could go home beautifully.
大家笑开了，“好啊，我们到时候一定去”。
Everyone laughed. "Well, we'll be there."
护士和剪掉的头发合影也有相对轻松的时刻，每剪完一个发型，医生护士围了一圈，“你这个头发还蛮潮流的嘛”。
The nurse also had a relatively light time with her haircut. After each haircut, the doctor and nurse surrounded it. "You're a bit of a fashion guy."
宋忠桥专门为女孩们设计了一款“波波头”，发顶头发留3-6厘米，后颈碎发推掉，前长后短，可以修饰脸型，“就很漂亮”。
Song Zhongqiao has designed a "Bobo Head" for girls, with a 3-6 centimeter haircut and a shredded back neck.
沈杰在抖音上开了剪发直播，平时理发，手机就放在工作台上。
Shen Jie opened a live haircut on the shaking sound, usually haircut, mobile phone on the work table.
有位护士提到自己明天过生日，“生日快乐”刷了满屏，她笑得眼睛弯起来：“谢谢谢谢！你们一定要去给理发师点赞哦！”甘书爽刻意避免聊到疫情相关的话题，总觉得心里有个疙瘩，又不敢碰，说多了怕大家都伤心。
A nurse mentioned her birthday tomorrow, "Happy Birthday" painted full screen, she bent her eyes: "Thank you! You must go to the barber Oh!" Gansu deliberately avoid talking about the epidemic-related topics, always feel a knot in one's heart, too much afraid to touch, afraid of everyone sad.
医疗队的多数人都没来过武汉，有人感叹，以前听说武汉好，想带爸妈来逛逛，没想到这次是以这种方式来。
Most of the medical team has not come to Wuhan, some people lament, heard that Wuhan good, want to take my parents to visit, did not expect this time is to come in this way.
他兴致来了，讲起武汉的种种好来，说等到疫情结束，一定要逛好了再回去——武汉过早特别丰富，热干面，牛肉面，豆皮，都好吃。
He was interested in talking about Wuhan good, said that when the end of the epidemic, must go back - Wuhan premature particularly rich, hot and dry noodles, beef noodles, beans, all delicious.
那些有名的连锁店都是骗外地人的，刁角巷子里才有你想不到的美味，自家附近熊师傅的热干面就做得好，面条筋道，芝麻酱的口感也醇厚，十块钱可以买一大碗。
Those famous chain stores are cheating outsiders, Diaojiao Lane only you can not think of the delicious, home nearby bear master's hot dry noodles, spaghetti straws, sesame paste taste mellow, 10 yuan can buy a big bowl.
武汉的景色也好，等到三月中旬，武大的樱花就该开了。
Wuhan scenery or until the middle of March, Wu Da cherry blossoms should be opened.
从武大凌波门出来就是东湖，要是个有阳光的好天气，湖面会泛起一片波光。
From the Wudaolingbo Gate is the East Lake, if a sunny day, the lake will be a wave light.
微信提示音时不时响起，妻子又打来视频电话了，甘书爽拿出手机，摁掉，再编个理由回过去，“在打游戏”。
Micromessage sound from time to time, his wife called again video phone, Gansu Shuang took out the phone, press it, and then make up a reason back to the past, "in the game."
他不想跟家里解释太多。
He didn't want to explain much to his family.
有天妻子打电话来，说看到他帮人剪发上新闻了，挺高兴的，不过还是放心不下，“已经做了就算了，以后还是别做了”。
One day his wife called and said she was very happy to see him help people cut their hair on the news, but still worried, "I have done it, or not to do it again."
他嘴上答应，却还是没停下，想着只要做“三观正”的事情，家里还是会支持的。
He said yes, but did not stop, thinking that as long as the "three-view" thing, the family will support.
每天晚上，甘书爽失眠到一两点。
Every night, Gansu Shuang insomnia to one or two.
他睡不着，反反复复想起白天的事，是不是有什么防护措施没做好？跟医生一起吃早饭，医生打了个喷嚏，有没有什么问题？今天鼻子不太舒服，该不会染上了吧？他打趣说，自己得了“疑心病”。
He couldn't sleep, he thought back and forth about the day, was there anything wrong with it? He had breakfast with the doctor, and the doctor sneezed, was there anything wrong? He wasn't feeling very well today, would he?
疑心归疑心，他还是提早安排好第二天的日程。
Suspiciously, he arranged his schedule for the next day ahead of schedule.
早上八点出发，一天剪50个人，晚上九点钟结束，坐车，回家。
Start at eight in the morning, cut 50 people a day, finish at nine in the evening, take a bus, go home.
