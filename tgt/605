我住在汉口，是这次疫情的重灾区。
I live in Hankou, which is the hardest hit area of the epidemic.
那个被查出疫情源头的华南海鲜市场，就在火车站对面，离我家大概20公里。
The South China Seafood Market, the source of the outbreak, is just across the train station, about 20 kilometers from my home.
我希望疫情早日结束，对我们国家的经济影响小一些，所有人都能够平安和健康。
I hope that the epidemic will end soon, that it will have less impact on the economy of our country and that all people will be safe and healthy.
口述 | 小 玲整理 | 沈 林我叫小玲，生于武汉，长于武汉，除了大学的4年外，我不曾长久地离开过武汉。
My name is Xiao Ling. I was born in Wuhan and grew up in Wuhan. I never left Wuhan long, except for four years at university.
武汉分武昌、汉阳和汉口三个大镇，我住在汉口，是这次疫情的重灾区，那个被查出疫情源头的华南海鲜市场，就在火车站对面，离我家大概20公里，市场卖的东西很多，过年的时候，我父母也会去那里采购一些水果。
Wuhan is divided into Wuchang, Hanyang and Hankou towns. I live in Hankou, the hardest hit area of the epidemic. The South China Seafood Market, which has been identified as the source of the epidemic, is just across the railway station, about 20 kilometers from my home.
12月底的时候，我正在南京旅游，当时手机弹出来一条信息：武汉出现不明原因肺炎。
At the end of December, I was traveling in Nanjing when a message popped up on my mobile phone: pneumonia was an unknown cause in Wuhan.
我还有点紧张，觉得发生了大事，当下就买了10个口罩。
I was a little nervous, I thought something was wrong, and now I bought 10 masks.
不过，当我结束假期回到武汉的时候，发现大家都很淡定——火车站没什么人戴口罩，小伙伴们也都不把它当回事儿。
However, when I returned to Wuhan after my holiday, I found that everyone was very quiet - there were few people wearing masks at the railway station, and my friends didn't take it seriously.
回想2003年非典的时候，对武汉的影响并不大，那个时候我大概五六年级吧，都不记得有什么针对措施了，好像就教室会消消毒，大家连口罩都不戴，也不用每天监控体温。
Back in 2003, when SARS had little impact on Wuhan, I probably did not remember the fifth or sixth grade, I do not remember any measures, as if the classroom will be disinfected, people do not even wear masks, and daily temperature monitoring.
后来，武汉政府说可防可控，我慢慢也就放下了心，觉得是不是自己小题大做了？真正的转折点，应该是看了钟南山院士的那个采访。
Later, Wuhan government said that it can be controlled, I slowly let down my mind, feel that is not their own overachievers? The real turning point, should be to see the Zhong Nan Shan academician that interview.
钟南山在电视里说，这个肺炎人传人。
Zhong Nan Shan said on television that the pneumonia is passed down from person to person.
身边的人一下子就变了行头，走在大街上，戴口罩的人蹭蹭蹭地变多了。
The people around him suddenly changed their outfits, walking down the street, and the people wearing masks dawdled more and more.
我跟老公29号的时候去店里补货，买口罩，很幸运刚刚到了一批，现在成为我和家人出门的必备单品。
My husband and I went to the store when the 29th, buy masks, very lucky just arrived a batch, now become me and the family out of the necessary items.
哦对了，还想表扬一下我的爸爸妈妈，跟网络上那些“顽固”的父母不同，这次他们特别主动地就做好了防护工作，都不怎么需要劝说，省心极了。
Oh yes, and want to praise my father and mother, unlike those "stubborn" parents on the Internet, this time they took the initiative to do a good job of protection, do not need to be persuaded, extremely relieved.
我们单位21号放假，我和老公就到了我父母家待着。
Our unit 21 holiday, my husband and I went to my parents' house to stay.
我老公家在襄阳，本来打算回家过除夕的，不过后来襄阳也封城了，只好跟公婆说暂时不回去了——这个时候，我们武汉的回去过年，反而对他们也是一个潜在的风险吧。
My husband's family in Xiangyang, originally intended to go home for New Year's Eve, but later Xiangyang also closed the city, had to tell her mother-in-law not to go back - at this time, we Wuhan back to celebrate the New Year, but it is also a potential risk to them.
放假后，我们单位需要每天统计一次人员情况。
After the vacation, our unit needs to count the staff every day.
我有个同事，年前发烧去了趟医院，医生跟她说我们没有办法收你住院，你只能自己回家隔离，然后每天去医院打针。
A colleague of mine went to the hospital with a fever a few years ago, and the doctor told her that we could not admit you to the hospital.
我还有一个同事被确诊了，跟我不是一个楼层办公，他已经被收治住院了，祝他早日康复。
One of my co-workers was diagnosed. He's not working on the same floor as me. He's been admitted to the hospital. Wish him a quick recovery.
我们家还是挺幸运的，没有人被传染，大家都很健康。
My family is lucky that no one is infected and everyone is in good health.
唯一有点担心的是我的表妹，她在汉阳一家医院当护士，不过也不是疫情的重点科室，不算是一线，他们的防护服也比较紧缺，前两天联系她的时候，她说她们科室的防护服都是轮着穿，比如说我上完白班，然后中班的人要上班的时候，白班的人就把他的那个防护服给到中班的人再用，幸好她的医院不是定点医院，危险性比较小。
The only worry was that my cousin, who worked as a nurse at a hospital in Hanyang, was not the main department of the epidemic, and their protective clothing was in short supply. When contacted the previous two days, she said that when I finished the day shift and the middle class had to work, the daytime shift reused his suit.
如果说一开始我们还有些担心，不过等到中央派了人接管工作后，就踏实多了。
We were a little worried at first, but it was a lot easier when the central government sent someone to take over the job.
后来陆续看到新闻，说上海、广州、四川还有许多地方的医疗队都抽调了医护人员过来，真的好感动。
Later to see the news, said that Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sichuan and many other places of the medical team have drawn medical staff to come, really moved.
还有很多工人在建设火神山医院和雷神山医院，一方有难八方支援，非典的时候没什么感觉，但现在轮到武汉，我们这些留守在家里的武汉人，心里暖洋洋的。
There are still many workers in the building of the Mount Fire Hospital and Lei Shenshan Hospital, one side difficult to eight parties support, SARS time did not feel, but now it is Wuhan, we left at home in Wuhan, the hearts of warm.
对了，还有很多省份给我们捐了爱心菜，山东的大白菜、江西的萝卜等等，我前两天去超市虽然没有买到，但还是很感谢他们。
By the way, there are many provinces donated love dishes, Shandong cabbage, Jiangxi radish, and so on, I went to the supermarket the other day although I did not buy them, but very grateful to them.
对了，那天去超市的时候，发现逛超市的年轻人居多，而且大家都戴了口罩，我妈说，平时都是老年人来逛，我想可能是因为专家说这个病老年人抵抗力比较差，是重点保护对象，所以大家都让老人在家里待着，安全。
When I went to the supermarket that day, I noticed that most of the young people were walking around the supermarket and they were wearing masks. My mother said it was usually old people who came to the supermarket.
而且，我们这里的超市物资也挺全的，逛超市也成了这些天自我隔离以后，出家门最远、路走得最多的一天。
Moreover, our supermarket material is also quite complete, shopping has become these days after self-isolation, the furthest out of the house, the most road walk the day.
还想表扬一下我们武汉的超市，我们去的一家超市，门口放了消毒液还有酒精棉片什么的，如果你要推购物车的话，就可以用酒精棉片消毒了，进超市之前，工作人员还会给你量体温，必须用免洗洗手液洗手，还提供了口罩，感觉比较安心。
Also want to praise our Wuhan supermarket, we went to a supermarket, the door put disinfectant and alcohol cotton pieces, if you want to push the cart, can be disinfected with alcohol cotton, before entering the supermarket, staff will take your temperature, must wash your hands with wash-free soap, and provide a mask, feeling more secure.
单位放假后，我们一直窝在我父母家，这里附近的小餐馆都关门了。
After the vacation, we stayed at my parents' house and all the small restaurants near here were closed.
逛超市那天路过一家酒店，发现他们养在鱼缸里的鱼都快死了，估计损失不小——说实话，我们也不敢下馆子，只能自己做饭。
A supermarket that day passed a hotel, found that their fish in the tank are dying, the estimated loss is not small - to tell the truth, we do not dare to eat out, can only cook their own.
闲下来，我们就看电视看新闻，看看体育节目，现在没得挑了，我妈还跟我抢电视呢，我只能把电视让给她老人家，拿手机追那个最近上线的《三生三世枕上书》，用最快的倍速看。
When we are free, we watch the news and watch sports. Now we have no choice. My mother still grabs the TV with me.
这两天也能看到网上一些针对武汉人在省外的评论，虽然有一些评论针对的是整个湖北或者武汉，看到觉得挺难过的。
These two days can also see some online against Wuhan people in the provincial comments, although some of the comments are directed at the whole Hubei or Wuhan, it felt very sad to see.
不过我觉得大部分网友还是对事不对人的，希望这个事情过去以后，大家还能客观地看待武汉和湖北。
However, I think most netizens are still wrong about things, I hope that after this event, we can also objectively view Wuhan and Hubei.
希望疫情早日结束，对我们国家的经济影响小一些，所有人都能够平安和健康。
Hopefully, the epidemic will end soon, with less impact on our national economy, and all people will be safe and healthy.
