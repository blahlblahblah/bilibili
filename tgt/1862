29岁的彭银华去年正式成为江夏区第一人民医院呼吸科的住院医师。

Peng Yinhua has always been a filial son in the eyes of his parents, a warm man who is willing to endure hardship in the eyes of his colleagues.
人们带着“未完成婚礼“的遗憾认识了彭银华医生。

他的妻子钟欣说，她会好好生下孩子，告诉他父亲是一个怎样的人。
His wife, Zhong Xin, said she would have a good time giving birth and telling his father what kind of man he was.
彭银华和妻子的婚纱照6楼6床的病人一个月前，彭银华是穿着防护服奔走在医院为患者送药的彭医生，感染后，他成为金银潭医院南一区6楼6床的病人。
Peng Yinhua, a six-bed patient on the sixth floor, became a 6-bed patient on the sixth floor of Gold and Silver Pool Hospital after being infected a month ago by Dr. Peng, who was in protective clothing to deliver medicine to his patients at the hospital.
凌云是安徽医科大学附属巢湖医院重症医学科护士长，2月2日她随着医疗队到达武汉，支援金银潭医院。
Ling Yun, head nurse of Chaohu Hospital attached to Anhui Medical University, arrived in Wuhan on February 2 with her medical team to support the gold and silver pool hospital.
期间，她照顾了彭银华四天，也记录了彭银华住院期间的状态。
During that time, she took care of Peng Yinhua for four days, also recorded the state of Peng Yinhua in hospital.
2月2日早上第一次接班，凌云就得知6床的小伙子叫彭银华，是一位29岁的呼吸科医生，“据说他两天看诊300多个门诊病人，因太累，抵抗力下降遭感染。
February 2 morning the first shift, Ling Yun learned that the six-bed young man named Peng Yinhua, a 29-year-old respiratory doctor, said he had visited more than 300 outpatients in two days and was suffering from fatigue and reduced resistance
”凌云印象里，第一次见到彭银华，他状态并不是很好，“他的呼吸促达40-50次/分，而且深大，是严重的碱中毒，就是过度通气。
"Lingyun impression, the first time to see Peng Yinhua, his state is not very good," he breathed 40-50 times / minute, and deep, is a severe alkalosis, or excessive ventilation.
”经过一系列治疗措施，下午以后，彭银华的血气分析指标开始向正常值迈了好大一步。
After a series of treatments, Peng Yinhua's blood-gas analysis began to take a step closer to normal after the afternoon.
凌云不断地给他报喜讯，“我跟他讲你的血气分析指标好多了，血氧饱和都有97、 96。
Ling Yun kept telling him the good news. "I told him your blood gas analysis was much better. Blood oxygen saturation was 97, 96.
他也是呼吸科医生，听到这些他心里是很开心的，他觉得自己有好的希望，所以心情特别好。
He was also a respirator, and it pleased him to hear that. He felt that he had a good chance, so he was in a good mood.
”当天晚上彭银华加了她的微信，“南一区，6楼，6床，您照顾的病人”。
That evening Peng Yinhua added her message, "South One, sixth floor, six beds, the patient you're looking after."
彭银华在微信里感谢护士长的照顾，他发来文字：今天辛苦护士长了，回家就好好休息休息。
Peng Yinhua in the micro-letter thank the head nurse care, he sent a message: Today's laborious head nurse, go home to rest well.
她时常能感受到彭银华的乐观。
She could often feel Peng Yinhua's optimism.
彭银华住的病房是普通病房临时改的，氧气接口只有一个。
Peng Yinhua's ward is a temporary reform of the general ward, oxygen interface only one.
做雾化必须把呼吸机的氧气接口拔下来。
For atomization, the oxygen interface of the respirator must be removed.
凌云个子比较小，床头摇高了，她够不着接口，每次都站在床沿上面给彭银华雾化，每次能雾化有效果，彭银华就会高兴地跟护士说，“我现在雾化，出来好多痰”。
Ling Yun is small, the head of the bed shook, she can not reach the interface, each time standing on the edge of the bed to Peng Yinhua fog, every time can fog effective, Peng Yinhua will happily say to the nurse, "I now fog, a lot of sputum."
凌云说彭银华也是个很勇敢的小伙子，非常配合护士工作。
Lingyun said Peng Yinhua is also a very brave young man, very cooperative nurse work.
“重症病人要抽动脉血，任何人抽动脉血都是很疼的，但是他动都不动，不吭一声。
"If a critically ill patient wants to draw blood from an artery, it hurts any person, but he won't move or say a word.
”最初护理的那两天，彭银华状态确实很好，凌云说他很有胃口，“第一天他主动吃了两碗稀饭，喝了一碗汤。
"The first two days of nursing, Peng Yinhua was really in good shape. Ling said he had an appetite." The first day he volunteered for two bowls of porridge and a bowl of soup.
很多得这个疾病的人其实是吃不下饭的。
A lot of people with this disease can't really eat.
”凌云在2月3日的抗疫日志记录下彭银华当天的状态，彭银华不但喝了一碗营养粥，又打开盒饭吃了起来。
Ling Yun recorded Peng Yinhua's condition on Feb. 3, when he drank a bowl of gruel and opened a box of rice to eat.
他说病好之后一定带家人去安徽游玩。
He said he would take his family to Anhui for an outing after his illness.
凌云的日记里写道：“期望你在安徽游玩时多发点朋友圈”。
Ling Yun's diary said: "Expect you to play in Anhui more friends circle."
彭银华住院期间，同事前来看望病情恶化“这一系列转好的现象现在看来只是表象。
Pang Yinhua was hospitalized, colleagues came to see the deterioration of the condition "this series of good phenomena now appears to be a mere symptom.
”凌云说，彭银华刚来金银潭医院的时候肺部情况并不好——双肺全白。
When Peng Yinhua first came to the gold and silver pool hospital, his lungs weren't good -- his lungs were all white, 'Mr. Ling said.
彭银华的同事陈海在年初一的时候也看过彭银华的CT。
Peng Yinhua's colleague Chen Hai also saw the CT of Peng Yinhua at the beginning of the new year.
陈海认为当时已经不太乐观，CT显示，其左肺叶、右肺叶均有病灶，其他地方也有。
Chen Hai believed that was not very optimistic at that time, CT showed that his left lobe, right lobe have lesions, other places.
但很多人都以为他能扛过去，毕竟他只有29岁。
But many thought he could carry it. After all, he was only 29.
病情进一步恶化从2月9日前后开始。
Further deterioration began around 9 February.
彭银华起床动了一下，结果晕倒了，凌云说从那以后就不太好。
Peng Yinhua got up and moved. He fainted. Ling said it wasn't so good since.
“这个病，动一点点立马就会气喘，心率加快。
"A little movement can make you breathless and your heart rate will pick up.
但是他自我感觉不是那么难受，插管的前一天晚上，有医护人员问他感觉怎么样？他都不觉得哪里特别难受，他真的觉得好像还行。
But he didn't feel so bad about himself. The night before the intubation, a paramedics asked him how he felt.
”2月10日中午，彭银华的心率突然开始上升，血氧饱和度很低，一直在40至70之间徘徊。
At noon on February 10, Peng's heart rate suddenly began to rise and her blood oxygen saturation was low, hovering between 40 and 70.
当天下午两点不到，医生进病房检查，开始插管。
Before two o'clock that afternoon, the doctor entered the ward and began to intubate.
插管以后，彭银华情况并没有好转，一点点糟糕下去。
After the intubation, Peng Yinhua's condition did not improve, a little bit worse.
几天后，他的肾脏出现问题，无法排出小便，医院开始做肾替代治疗。
A few days later, he developed kidney problems and was unable to urinate, and the hospital began to undergo renal replacement therapy.
20号白天，肝脏衰竭，又进行了血浆置换。
By day 20, liver failure, and a plasma exchange.
与此同时，彭银华还伴有严重的酸中毒。

此后，他的肺也开始出现问题，凌云说当时肺的二氧化碳负压已经达到80多。
Since then, his lungs have also begun to show problems, Lingyun said at that time lung carbon dioxide negative pressure has reached more than 80.
凌云发现，这个病到重症期以后，病情变化很快。
Ling Yun found that the disease after the severe period, the disease changes quickly.
她问过权威的医生，医生说这个病的炎症爆发期一般有15天的期限，挺过去了，人就能挺过来。
She asked an authoritative doctor who said the inflammatory phase of the disease usually has a 15-day deadline to survive.
彭银华没挺过来。
Mr. Pang didn't make it.
2月20日晚上21点50分，6楼6床的病人、医生彭银华过世了。
February 20th, 21: 50 p.m., the 6th floor 6 bed patient, doctor Peng Yinhua died.
“我们护理组都很难受，没想到一个29岁的人都没过来。
"We were all in a really bad mood and we didn't expect a 29-year-old to show up.
”凌云发文悼念他，“护理您时觉得很省心，知道怎么配合无创呼吸机，配合护士的各种穿刺......您可知道，我们大家等着和您拍胜利的照片。
Ling Yun-wen paid tribute to his memory. "It's so easy to care for you and know how to fit in with a non-invasive ventilator and nurse's puncture... You know, we're all waiting for pictures of you to win.
”彭银华殉职后，同事们为他举办了一个简单的悼念会，同事在留言簿上写下心里话刚开始的医师生涯医生彭银华的职业生涯其实在29岁才刚开始，他的履历简单明了。
After Peng's death, colleagues held a brief memorial service for him, at which colleagues wrote in a message book about his budding physician, Peng Yinhua, whose career as a physician had only just begun at the age of 29 and his curriculum vitae was brief.
协和江南医院医务科科长钟磊介绍，彭银华是湖北科技学院临床医学专业2015届的本科毕业生。
Zhong Lei, the medical section chief of Concorde Jiangnan Hospital, said Peng Yinhua was a 2015 undergraduate in clinical medicine at Hubei Institute of Technology.

”陈浩说，1月24日（年三十）的时候，医院的氛围很紧张，每个人情绪都拉得很紧。

Mr. Pang's unwitting parents have been buying their son wedding supplies since January 5. "The hotel was already booked, but it was too late for the wedding.

Peng Yinhua's sister mentioned in an interview that Peng's sudden death was a psychological shock to parents, that his father was in poor health and that treatment was expensive after the stroke.

Peng Yinhua left no trace on his social network, and his last microgram was a wedding photo of him in a light grey suit with his wife in a wedding dress, set in a green background.
春天快到了，钟欣最终没有等来自己的婚礼，丈夫殉职后，钟欣说会把孩子生下来，“银华喜欢孩子，我也喜欢孩子，我知道（单亲妈妈）不容易，我有心理准备。
Spring is approaching, Zhong Xin finally did not wait for her wedding, her husband died on duty, Zhong Xin said the baby will be born, "Yinhua likes children, I like children, I know [single mother] is not easy, I have psychological preparation.
