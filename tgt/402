赵彬的集团业务板块涉及住宿、婚宴、团膳、外卖等，目前住宿和外卖业务还在继续运营，“尽管只有个位数的客人入住，我们也得继续运转，但一天的运转成本就需要15万元左右。
Zhao Bin's business plate involves accommodation, wedding dinners, group meals, takeaway, etc., and the current accommodation and take-out business continues to operate. "Although only a single-digit number of guests check in, we have to continue to operate, but the daily running cost is about $150,000.
”她告诉记者，加上员工每月300多万元的工资支出，目前账面的资金还能维持近三个月。
With employees spending more than $3 million a month on salaries, she told reporters the book's funds were still available for nearly three months.
餐饮业作第三产业服务消费行业，不仅是民生刚需，也是消费升级背景下拉动内需的重要引擎。

根据中国饭店协会公布的2019年全国餐饮收入数据。
According to 2019 national catering revenue data released by the China Hotel Association.
2019年全国餐饮收入46721亿元，比上年增长9.4%，高于2018年的7.7%；12月份餐饮收入4825亿元。

In 2003, she said, there would be a boom in the catering industry, "after SARS for about two weeks everyone went out to make amends."
但目前的问题是，有多少家餐饮企业能撑过这两三个月？”王洪涛告诉记者，餐饮行业本身集中度不高，像西贝这样的企业现金都只能撑三个月，那些中小型的企业有可能这次就会面临倒闭。
But the question now is, how many restaurants can survive these two or three monthsWang told reporters that the catering industry itself is not very concentrated, such as Xibei enterprises cash can only last three months, those small and medium-sized enterprises may face collapse this time.

针对冲击，王洪涛呼吁，除了对正常生活的关注外，希望各方关注餐饮产业所面临的“灾难”。

“餐饮行业在保障就业方面其实发挥了非常大的作用，有庞大的门店数量和就业员工。
"The restaurant industry has actually played a very big role in securing employment, with a large number of stores and employees.
我们也希望在一定的时间内能够针对这个产业能够出台一些后续的政策，包括大家提到的员工的五险一金、所得税，或者贷款，给大家一些缓冲时间。
We also hope to have some follow-up policies for the industry in the near future, including employee insurance premiums, income taxes, or loans, to give you some time off.
”他说，目前暂停营业的餐饮企业不仅照常发工资，还在为疫情作公益。
He said restaurants now suspended were not only paying salaries but also serving the public interest in the epidemic.
如果疫情再延续一段时间，企业的压力特别大。
Companies are under particular pressure if the epidemic continues for some time.

“疫情发生以来，出于安全考虑，我们集团的100多家酒店目前已经停业了，目前还有70多家依然在营业的酒店，但是入住率非常低，比多年前SARS时的入住率还要低很多，压力非常大。
"Since the outbreak, more than 100 hotels in our group have been closed for security reasons, and there are more than 70 hotels still open, but occupancy rates are very low, much lower and very stressful than they were years ago when SARS was introduced.
”一家大型连锁酒店创始人告诉第一财经记者。
The founder of a large hotel chain told the first financial reporter.
记者从首旅如家、华住、锦江等连锁酒店企业了解到，疫情发生以来，不少酒店比去年同期入住率下滑80%以上，有一些高星级酒店在春节期间的平均入住率仅仅4%，相对而言，即便在多年前SARS时期，当时的同类酒店也有30%～40%的入住率。
Since the outbreak, many hotels have seen occupancy rates drop more than 80 percent from the same period last year, with some high-star hotels averaging just 4 percent during the Spring Festival, compared with 30 percent to 40 percent for similar hotels even years ago.

首旅如家酒店集团总经理兼如家酒店集团董事长、CEO孙坚对第一财经记者表示，目前这个阶段降本降费降税对酒店企业而言是最直接最有效的，建议可以出台阶段性的政策、包括房租补贴、五金减免或缓交、税收优惠、企业免息贷款等等。
Sun Jian, general manager of a hotel group and chairman and chief executive of Rujie Hotels Group, told the first financial reporter that reducing costs and lowering taxes at this stage is the most direct and effective way for hotel companies to put in place phased policies, including rent subsidies, hardware rebates or deferrals, tax breaks, interest-free corporate loans, etc.
相较费用的问题，目前最让酒店业者棘手的还有人员安置问题。
Compared with the cost of the problem, the hotel industry is the most difficult problem of resettlement.
上述大型连锁酒店创始人向第一财经记者表示，3万名非本地员工中，目前有约1万名员工在杭州当地，暂时停业100多家酒店后，大量员工也无法上班，整个春节都住在员工宿舍，这样一来，员工的管理压力和企业成本压力都很大，希望能有一些相关的政策出台来保障员工的安全和利益。
Some 10,000 of the 30,000 non-local employees are now in Hangzhou, where more than 100 hotels are temporarily closed, and a large number of staff are unable to work and live in staff quarters throughout the Spring Festival, the founders of the big hotel chains told First Financial.
