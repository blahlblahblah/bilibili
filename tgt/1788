“现在除了医院、药店买不着口罩，剩下的都在卖口罩。
"I can't buy a mask except in hospitals and pharmacies. The rest of them are selling masks.
”蒋坤说，在卖方市场里，“有口罩的就是‘爷爷’”。
'In the seller's market, 'Grandpa' is the one with the mask, 'says Mr. Chiang.

Photo / Beijing News photographer Li Gui Han, editor of Xinjing News, has about 5680 words. Read the full text about 11 minutes. On February 14, some netizens found Li No on a micro-letter, wanting to use a mask as a tattoo deposit.
李野是成都一家文身工作室的老板，2月初以来一直试图通过各种渠道购买口罩，但收效甚微。
Li No, the owner of a tattoo studio in Chengdu, has been trying to buy masks through various channels since early February, with little success.
“最近看你找口罩如此艰辛，我就说给你寄点口罩来当订金。
"I've been looking hard for you to find a mask lately, so I told you to send you a mask as a deposit.
”网友说，他给李野发来一个定位，显示自己正在韩国。
Netizens said he had sent Li a location showing he was in South Korea.
收到网友寄来的50个韩国KF94口罩后，李野很开心，把这件事当成段子分享到了朋友圈：“没想到我们成了国内第一家用口罩抵订金的文身工作室。
After receiving 50 Korean KF94 masks from netizens, Li was very happy and shared it with his friends. "I didn't expect that we became the first tattoo studio in China to use masks for deposit.
”新冠肺炎疫情发生以来，多家媒体报道称，戴口罩是阻断呼吸道分泌物传播的有效手段，医用外科口罩和对非油性颗粒的过滤效果大于等于95%的口罩能很好地预防呼吸道疾病。
Since the outbreak, various media reports have said wearing masks is an effective way to block respiratory secretions, and that surgical masks and respirators that filter non-oily particles more than 95 per cent can be effective in preventing respiratory illnesses.
为此，口罩成了最畅销的防疫物资之一，全网脱销，一“罩”难求。
To this end, masks have become one of the best-selling epidemic prevention materials, the entire network out of stock, a "cover" difficult to find.
由于许多专家建议，如非必要，居民应尽量少出门或不出门，这样才能最大程度的降低病毒传染。
Many experts have suggested that residents should stay out of the house as little as possible if not necessary to minimize the spread of the virus.
不出门如何买到口罩？网购成了大多数人的选择。
How to buy a mask without going out? Internet buying has become the choice of most people.
买口罩太难了在四川姑娘林龄的印象里，口罩限购是从1月20日开始的。
Buying a mask is too difficult. Lin Ling, a Sichuan girl, said the ban began on January 20.
此前的1月18日，她还在自家附近的药店里买了两包共20个一次性医用口罩，只要10块钱。
Earlier, on January 18, she bought two bags of 20 disposable medical masks at her local drugstore for as little as $10.
但两天后，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山公开表示新冠肺炎“人传人”，当天晚上，林龄发现某网店的一次性医用口罩开始限购了：每名用户限购2包共40个。
But two days later, Zhong Nan-shan, head of the high-level group of experts at the National Fitness and Wellness Commission, said he was "human-to-human" about pneumonia.
接下来的一段时间，想要网购口罩越来越难：不少电商卖家对口罩进行了下架处理；有的电商平台，口罩的发货日期已延迟至一两个月之后；少量有现货的平台，则对消费者购买行为做出种种限制。
Over the next few days, it has become harder and harder to buy face masks online: many vendors have pulled them off shelves; some have delayed deliveries to a month or two later; and a few have existing platforms that place restrictions on consumer purchases.
比如在某零售商手机APP中，口罩先是与价值199元的食材套餐捆绑销售，解绑后又推出限量抢购活动：凭借身份证号，每人每天限购3个口罩。
For example, in a retailer's mobile phone APP, the mask is sold in bundles with 199 yuan worth of food products.
在某电商平台，买口罩要先在指定时间预约抢购资格，预约成功后再在另一指定时间参与抢购，每天限量1万个。
In an electric business platform, buy a mask at a designated time to book a pre-qualification, after the success of the appointment at another designated time to participate in the rush, a daily limit of 10,000.
在另一电商平台，同一用户ID每5天限购1份口罩，数量不定，但不少消费者吐槽“抢购永远都是秒没”。
On another e-commerce platform, the same user ID every five days to buy a limited number of masks, but many consumers spit out "Buying is always a second."
林龄在不同网店陆续下了几单，“加起来有几百个口罩”。
Lin Ling in different online shop successively under a few orders, "add up to a few hundred masks".
但截至2月14日，除了1月20日当晚买到的40个口罩外，她再没收到其他口罩。
However, as of 14 February, she had received no other masks than the 40 she had bought on the night of 20 January.
一名售卖N95口罩的商家因虚假销售口罩被平台关店，系统为林龄退了钱。
A businessman selling N95 masks was shut down by the platform for selling fake masks, and the system returned money for Lin.
一名商家称工厂被征用了，让她申请退款。
A businessman claimed that the factory had been expropriated and asked her to apply for a refund.
在北京工作的王庄庄参与过多次口罩抢购。
Wang Zhuangzhuang, who works in Beijing, has been involved in many mask-buying.
2月12日晚，她听朋友说某海淘平台会放出一批来自印度的一次性医用口罩，放货时间为当晚9点半。
On the night of Feb. 12, she heard a friend say a tog platform would release a batch of disposable medical masks from India at 9: 30 pm.
王庄庄分析，彼时许多城市白领还困在县城或农村老家，手边没有电脑，只能用手机购物。
Wang Zhuang Zhuang analysis, when many urban white-collar workers are still stranded in the county or rural home, hands-on no computers, can only use mobile phones shopping.
为避开流量冲突，王庄庄另辟蹊径选择了网页抢购，竟然买到了2包共100个口罩。
In order to avoid the flow conflict, Wang Zhuang chose a different way to snag, unexpectedly bought a total of 2 packs 100 masks.
事后她才知道，因为访问量过大，原定9点半的抢购延迟了，但因为某种系统漏洞，她在网页上抢购成功。
It was only later that she learned that the 9: 30 rush had been delayed because of the volume of interviews, but that she had snapped it up on the Web because of a system vulnerability.
王庄庄的经验，来自于屡败屡战的教训。
Wang Zhuang's experience comes from the lessons of repeated defeats.
那次成功前，她已在5个购物平台下单够买了370个口罩，如果不算退款的话，已花费近3000元。
Before that success, she had ordered 370 masks on five shopping platforms, and had already spent nearly $3,000, if not a refund.
但截至2月18日，她一个口罩都没收到。
As of 18 February, however, she had not received a single mask.
1月30日，王庄庄在韩国某购物网站买了20个N95口罩。
On January 30, Wang Zhuang bought 20 N95 masks on a Korean shopping site.
受访者供图王庄庄在海淘网站上抢购的口罩，至今尚未发货。
Interviewees for Wang Zhuang Zhuang in Haitao website snapped up masks, so far has not been shipped.
受访者供图自1月下旬起，浙江嘉兴姑娘李丹也加入了买口罩的行列。
Since late January, Zhejiang Jiaxing girl Li Dan has joined the list of masks.
通过网络代购，她先后从日本、韩国买到了120个一次性医用口罩、60个KF94口罩。
She bought 120 disposable medical masks and 60 KF94 masks from Japan and South Korea on behalf of the Internet.
她以为自己不会缺口罩了，就把这些口罩捐给了县城医院、分给了亲戚朋友。
Believing she would have no gaps left, she donated the masks to the county hospital and distributed them to relatives and friends.
可当她再次寻找代购时发现，日本、韩国已经买不到了。
But when she looked for a replacement, Japan and South Korea could not buy it.
2月10日左右，李丹联系上了远在葡萄牙的朋友。
Around February 10, Li Dan contacted friends as far away as Portugal.
朋友说，葡萄牙的口罩已经开始缺货，价格明显上涨。
Friends say Portuguese masks have been out of stock and prices have risen sharply.
“以前一盒卖4欧（约30元），现在要12.5欧（约95元），涨了三倍。
"It used to be four euros (about 30 dollars) a box, but now it's 12.5 euros (about 95 yuan), up three times.
”为啥人人抢口罩？李丹承认，自己不停买口罩是因为“怕死”。
Why would anyone take a mask? Mr Li admits he keeps buying them because he is "afraid of death."
作为已知的隔绝病毒的有效措施，口罩是李丹获得安全感的重要方式之一：不得不和陌生人接触的时候，戴上口罩，事情似乎变得可控了。
The mask is one of Li Dan's most important ways to feel safe as a known antivirus: Wear a mask when you have to come into contact with strangers, and things seem to get under control.
无法避免与陌生人接触，同样令林龄恐慌。
Unable to avoid contact with strangers, Lin Ling also panic.
疫情引起广泛关注时，林龄已回到南充老家，县城也出现了确诊病例。
When the epidemic caused widespread concern, Lin Ling has returned to his hometown of Nanchong, the county has also appeared confirmed cases.
她看了大量与口罩相关的科普文章，知道在众多品类的口罩中，N95系列防护效果最好，医用外科口罩次之，一次性医用口罩更差。
She looked at a raft of popular science articles about masks and knew that N95 was the best protection for a wide variety of masks, followed by surgical masks for medical use and even worse for disposable masks.
她甚至可以肉眼辨识路人口罩的真伪。
She can even tell the truth of a passer-by's mask with her naked eye.
偶尔出门买菜时，她会仔细观察那些挂在陌生人脸上的口罩——年轻人的口罩大都质量较好，甚至会出现难买的N95或者3M的KN95系列；但一些老年人的口罩质量很差，薄薄的一层，透光，“鼻子都能看到”；还有人戴的甚至不是一次性医用口罩，只是对病毒几乎没有过滤作用的布口罩或海绵口罩。
Occasionally, while out shopping, she scrutinizes masks that hang on strangers' faces - most of them of better quality, even the difficult N95 or 3M KN95 series; but some older people have poor quality masks, a thin layer that is transparent and "visible from the nose"; still others wear even non-disposable medical masks, cloth masks or sponge masks that have little filtering effect on viruses.

2月19日，在国务院联防联控机制召开新闻发布会上，国家发展改革委运行局二级巡视员唐社民表示，近几日口罩产能的利用率一直在100%以上，2月17日达到110%。
On February 19, at a press conference held by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism (JCMB), Tang Che-min, second-degree inspector of the NDRC Operational Bureau, said the utilization rate of mask capacity had been above 100 percent in recent days, reaching 110 percent on February 17.
此前，中国纺织品商业协会安全健康防护用品委员会会长雷利民在接受媒体采访时表示，截至2月底，预计每天能生产各类口罩1.8亿个。
Earlier, Rilimin, head of the China Textile Business Association's safety and health protection committee, told reporters that 180 million face masks were expected to be produced every day by the end of February.
但按照界面新闻的测算，各行业一旦复工，需求端的激增远远超过口罩产能的增长。
But once industries get back to work, demand-side surges far outstrip mask-capacity growth, according to estimates from the Interface News.
按照第四次全国经济普查数据，国内法人单位和个体经营户合计就业人口高达5.33亿人，按每人每天一个的用量口罩计算，每天至少需要5.33亿个口罩。
According to data from the fourth national economic census, 533 million people are employed in domestic enterprises and self-employed households combined, requiring at least 533 million masks per person per day, based on one mask per person per day.
换言之，当每天5.33亿的口罩需求遇到不到2亿的产能，每天的口罩缺口超过3亿。
In other words, when the demand for 533m face masks a day is less than 200m, the gap is over 300m a day.
按照放假前的公司安排，2月3日起，林龄将要回到成都上班。
According to the company arrangements before the holiday, February 3, Lin Ling will return to work in Chengdu.
1月30日，林龄接到了公司的通知：线下复工延后，具体时间待定。
On January 30, Lin Ling received a notice from the company: off-line resumption of work has been postponed, specific time to be determined.
林龄从焦虑中冷静下来，开始寻找起口罩的替代品，防溢乳垫因此进入她的视线。
Ling calmed down from her anxiety and began to look for a replacement for the mask, which allowed her to see the milkmats.
那本是哺乳期女性防止渗乳的用品，滤芯材料跟口罩差不多，因此被许多微商打上了“口罩垫片”的标签。
That is breast-feeding women prevent breast-feeding supplies, filter material is similar to the mask, so many micro-merchants put on the "mask pad" label.
林龄购买的防溢乳垫。
Lin Ling buys anti-overflow pads.
受访者供图针对此事，医疗健康领域自媒体“丁香医生”2月18日表示，防溢乳垫只能防止液体渗透，无法确保有效过滤细菌或病毒，“（用防溢乳垫自制口罩）约等于‘裸奔’。
Breast-off mattresses can only prevent fluid penetration and do not ensure effective filtering of bacteria or viruses. "[using anti-milkmats] to make your masks run nude," the media said on Tuesday.
”但林龄认为“约等于裸奔”总比“裸奔”好，“约等于裸奔还是可以出门的。
But Lin thinks it's better to be "running naked" than "running naked," "about the same as running naked."
”她选择了众多哺乳期女性推荐的款式，透气性很好，先后买了400片。
She chose the style recommended by many lactating women and breathable enough to buy 400.
如果复工前还没买到足够的口罩，她会把这些乳垫放进口罩里，每3小时更换一次。
If she hasn't bought enough masks before returning to work, she puts them in a mask and changes them every three hours.
这样，口罩就可以重复使用。
This way, the mask can be reused.
公司采购与个人买家狭路相逢江宇在某医疗器械公司从事采购工作，为了筹备复工，需要购买大量口罩。
Company Procurement and Individual Buyers Jiang Yu in a medical equipment company engaged in procurement work, in order to prepare to resume work, need to buy a large number of masks.
因为公司需求不断增长，他很难确定多少口罩才算足够。
With the company's growing demand, it's hard for him to determine how many masks will be enough.
依据国家卫健委2月5日公布的《预防新型冠状病毒感染口罩选择与使用技术指引》（下称《口罩指南》），江宇公司下属的工厂属于人员密集区，推荐使用一次性医用口罩。
According to the Technical Guidelines on the Selection and Use of New Coronavirus Infection Mask Masks (hereinafter referred to as the Mask Guide) issued by the National Fitness and Health Commission on February 5, 2006, Jiangyu's factories are densely populated areas. Disposable medical masks are recommended.
“公司希望按照国家分级防护的规定来，不用过度防护。
"Companies want to follow national grading rules and not be overly protective," he said.
但各部门的领导都觉得，我要保护好自己的员工，还是希望买到防护等级更高的口罩。
But department heads feel I have to protect my staff or want to buy a more protective mask.
”江宇说。
"said Jiang.
然而不同防护等级的口罩，对应着不同的采购难度。
However, different levels of protection of respirators, corresponding to different procurement difficulties.
依据江宇的观察，国内已经很难买到N95或者KN95系列的口罩了，只能寄希望于美国和英国的同事。
Based on Jiang Yu's observation, it has become difficult to buy N95 or KN95 mask, can only hope that colleagues in the United States and the United Kingdom.
“国内的话，现在的重点是让大家去买一次性医用口罩。
"At home, the emphasis now is on getting everyone to buy disposable medical masks.
”江宇说。
"said Jiang.
作为公司采购，质量是江宇最在意的问题之一。
As a company procurement, quality is one of the most important problems Jiang Yu cares about.
按照正常流程，他会要求供应方提供产品的品牌名称、检验报告、厂商的《医疗器械生产许可证》以及样品，并到工厂实地考察。
Under the normal procedure, he would require suppliers to provide brand names, inspection reports, manufacturers' licenses for the manufacture of medical devices and samples, as well as on-site visits to factories.
但现在买口罩实在太难了，面对严苛的标准流程，他只好一步步后退。
But now it's too difficult to buy a mask, and he has to step back from the rigors of standard procedures.
一次，有人给江宇提供了一批口罩，并按照江宇的要求附上了口罩照片、营业执照和检验报告。
Once, someone provided Jiang Yu with a batch of masks and attached a mask photo, business license and inspection report as required by Jiang Yu.
但江宇发现，几份材料间没什么关系，“口罩是A品牌的，营业执照是B品牌的，检验报告是C品牌的。
But Jiang found that several materials between the relationship, "mask is A brand, business license is B brand, inspection report is C brand.
”江宇说，这种情况下自己会追问细节，但对方往往会说 “我只有这些”或者直接不再回复。
Mr. Jiang says he will ask for details in such cases, but the other side will often say 'I have only these' or simply won't answer.
江宇还从韩国购买过2000个KF94口罩。
Jiang also bought 2,000 KF94 masks from South Korea.
KF94是韩国的防护口罩防护级别，即对直径0.4微米的颗粒物滤过率大于94%。
The KF94 is the protection level for face masks in Korea, i.e. the filtration rate of particulate matter of 0.4 microns in diameter is greater than 94%.
“说实话，我们对韩国KF94的标准已经放松很多了。
"To be honest, our standards for the KF94 in South Korea have been much more relaxed.
因为他发过来的证书我们看不懂，即便看懂了，也不知道它能不能和我拿到的口罩对上。
Because he sent the certificate we do not understand, even if you understand, I do not know if it and I get the mask on the opposite.
”江宇说，他只能寄希望于这些韩国口罩是通过海关正规进口的，“因为海关至少可以保证你的东西不是三无产品。
Mr. Jiang said he could only hope that the masks were imported through customs, "because customs can at least guarantee that you don't have three products."
”采购过程中，江宇逐渐发现供应商无法满足公司需求，转而开始向微商、代购等游离于主流市场之外的口罩售卖者求助。
During the procurement process, Jiang gradually discovered that suppliers were unable to meet the company's needs and turned to vendors who were outside the mainstream market, such as micromarketers and buying agents.
正常情况下，这些散兵游勇式的卖家对应的是个人消费者，而非成规模采购的公司。
Normally, these casual sellers correspond to individual consumers, not to companies buying on a large scale.
但这一次，在新冠肺炎疫情下，公司采购与个人买家狭路相逢。
But this time, under the new crown pneumonia epidemic, the company's procurement and individual buyers meet.
“从买方的角度来说，我们没什么优势。
"From the buyer's point of view, we have no advantage.
”江宇说，和公司相比，个人购买者决策更迅速，对价格的容忍度也更高。
Individual buyers make faster decisions and have greater tolerance for prices than companies, says Mr Jiang.
比如一个口罩30元，公司买1万个就是30万，是一大笔钱。
For example, a mask cost 30 yuan, the company bought 10,000 is 300,000, is a large sum of money.
“但如果是个人买，咬咬牙买10个也才300块钱，无所谓。
"But if it's a personal purchase and it's only 300 bucks for 10, it doesn't matter.
”良莠不齐的卖方市场与口罩脱销相伴的，是一批又一批出现在微信朋友圈、在各个二手交易平台的口罩经销商。
Herbicide sellers' markets and mask sales have been accompanied by a spate of small-letter friends and mask dealers on a variety of second-hand trading platforms.
自由职业者蒋坤是2月初加入这个行列的。
Freelancer Chiang Kun joined the group in early February.
当时他帮朋友在药店买消毒液，却发现想买口罩的人更多，可药店里根本没口罩。
He helped friends buy disinfectant at the drugstore, but more people wanted to buy masks, but there were no masks in the drugstore.
蒋坤在医疗行业有些人脉，可以找到货源，此后便在朋友圈里倒腾起了口罩。
Jiang Kun in the medical industry some contacts, can find the source of goods, then in the circle of friends toss up a mask.
“我拿到口罩后，每个加价5毛钱卖出去，有人觉得贵，不买；但我加价3块钱再卖，这口罩依然可以卖出去。
"When I got the mask, I sold it for 50 cents each and someone thought it was expensive. But I added $3 to sell it, and it still sold.
因为始终有人要口罩。
Because someone always needs a mask.
”蒋坤说。
"said Chiang Kun.
刘明也从2月初开始卖口罩的。
Liu Ming has also been selling masks since early February.
他挂出过一款自称是N95的蓝色口罩，单价29元。
He hung out a blue mask calling itself N95 for 29 yuan each.
图片里，几十个口罩被装在同一个透明塑料袋里，没有单独包装。
Dozens of masks are packed in the same transparent plastic bag, not individually.
这些口罩据说是“一个哥们从老家带过来的”，没有具体生产厂家，一天后，100多个口罩卖得只剩20多个了。
The masks are said to have been brought "by a buddy from his hometown" without a specific manufacturer, and a day later, more than 100 masks were sold for more than 20.
刘明属于那种什么火就卖什么的人，排队、代购、跑腿的业务都能接。
Liu Ming belongs to what kind of fire to sell what people, queuing, buying, running errands business can be met.
2019年夏天球鞋市场最热时，他经常到北京三里屯帮人排队买鞋。
At the height of the summer 2019 market, he often queues up to buy shoes in Sanlitun, Beijing.
到了2019年冬天，他的朋友圈里都是口罩、酒精、洗手液。
By the winter of 2019, his circle of friends was covered in masks, alcohol and hand sanitizers.
来自越南的翻译金敏、做外贸生意的张俊，也都做起了口罩生意。
Jin Min, a translator from Vietnam, and Zhang Jun, who does foreign trade business, also set up a mask business.
金敏的口罩以KF94为主，从昆明发货，单价30元；张俊称自己卖的一次性口罩产自印度，需要从印度经马来西亚发往自己所在的广西，之后再发往全国各地。
Kim's mask is mainly KF94 and shipped from Kunming at a unit price of 30 yuan. Zhang said his disposable mask, made in India, needs to be shipped from India to Guangxi, where he lives via Malaysia, before being sent to all parts of the country.
某电商网站上，购买口罩需要先预约、再抢购。
On the website of an electric business, buy masks need to make an appointment, then rush to buy.
超过200万人预约抢购限量发售的1万件口罩。
More than 2 million people have booked a limited sale of 10,000 face masks.
网页截图“现在除了医院、药店买不着口罩，剩下的都在卖口罩。
"Now except for hospitals, pharmacies can not buy masks, the rest are selling masks.
”蒋坤说，在卖方市场里，“有口罩的就是‘爷爷’。
'In the seller's market, 'Grandpa' is the one with the mask, 'says Mr. Chiang.
”“有人一天给我打5个电话，他得求着我。
"" Someone called me five times a day and he had to beg for me.
他就算挂了电话骂我，但是打电话的时候他得毕恭毕敬了。
He'd hang up and scold me, but he'd have to be respectful when he called.
不然我不高兴，多少钱都不卖给他。
Otherwise I am not happy, how much money does not sell to him.
”蒋坤说即便如此，他每天一睁眼想的就是口罩，找上门的买家“停都停不下来”。
Even so, he says, the only thing he thinks about every day is masks, and buyers who come to him "can't stop."
江宇也有过类似感受。
Jiang had similar feelings.
他发现曾经没什么话语权的供应商，因为手里有了口罩，心态变了。
He found that suppliers who had had little say changed their minds because they had masks in their hands.
他记得某家供应商的产品少，很抢手，电话沟通时销售人员“抑制不住自己的喜悦”。
He remembers the product of a certain supplier is few, very hot, the sales person when telephone communicates "cannot restrain oneself joyful".
“他跟我说，不好意思，我太兴奋了，我感觉我原来一直当孙子，现在终于能够硬气一点了。
"He said to me, sorry, I'm so excited, I feel like I've been a grandson, and now I can finally get a little tough.
”五花八门的线上交易在口罩市场中，买家和卖家是相对的，身为卖家的蒋坤也要从其他人手上买口罩。
In the mask market, where buyers and sellers are opposites, Chiang Kun, a seller, buys masks from others.
在这个过程中，蒋坤变得被动，一不留神就可能着了别人的道。
In this process, Chiang Kun became passive, unmindful of the possibility of other people's way.
一次，蒋坤找人订了1万个N95口罩，现货，总价20万元。
Once, Jiang Kun asked someone to order 10,000 N95 masks, spot, a total price of 200,000 yuan.
但等了10天卖家都没发货，口罩单价也从20元涨到了25元。
But after 10 days of waiting, the seller did not deliver the mask unit price rose from 20 yuan to 25 yuan.
“这个时候，他怎么可能再以20万的价格卖给我这1万个口罩？”蒋坤说，最终对方全额退款。
"At this point, how can he sell me these 10,000 masks for another 200,000 dollars?" Chiang said, and was eventually refunded in full.
蒋坤怀疑，对方拿着自己的货款做起了“无本万利”的买卖：用买家A交来的货款低价购入一批口罩，再以高价卖给买家B，赚钱后给卖家A全额退款。
Jiang Kun suspects that the other party took their own money to make a "no-profit" sale: Buy a lot of masks at a low price from buyer A, sell them to buyer B at a high price, and make a full refund to seller A after making a profit.
为了买口罩，李野还遭遇过不少骗局。
Li has also encountered a number of scams to buy masks.
2月初，李野从微商手里订购了40个口罩，算上邮费，总共128元。
At the beginning of February, Mr. Li ordered 40 masks from microvendors, for a total of 128 yuan, including postage.
但交过钱后，微商不回消息、不接电话、不发货，李野觉得居然有人为了一百多块钱骗人，有点不能理解。
But after paying money, micro-business message, do not answer the phone, do not deliver goods, Li No felt that someone in order to more than 100 dollars to deceive people, a bit incomprehensible.
没过两天，有人自称可以提供500个一次性医用口罩，单价5元。
Within two days, someone claimed to be able to provide 500 disposable medical masks at a unit price of $5.
有了之前的教训，李野表示自己要带着现金面对面验货、提货，“如果东西没问题，我当场就把钱给了。
Having learned the lesson before, Mr. Li said he wanted to take cash face-to-face to inspect and pick up the goods. "If things are OK, I give them the money on the spot.
”那条信息发过去，对方便开始用各种理由推脱，还说要看货得先交订金。
The message was sent, and the convenience began to be excused for various reasons, and it was said that a deposit was required to see the goods.
就在李野准备转账时，微信弹出了“本次交易存在欺诈风险……暂时无法完成”的提示，对方解释称之前有人故意找茬，把自己举报了，暂时无法收款。
Li No prepared to transfer, micro-letter popped up "this transaction fraud risk... temporarily unable to complete," the other side explained that someone before deliberately stubble, reported themselves, temporarily unable to collect.
但第二天再次转钱时，对方依然账号异常，李野急了，要马上开车过去提货，但对方依然拒绝。
But the next day when the money transfer, the other side account is still abnormal, Li No urgent, to immediately drive to pick up the goods, but the other side still refused.
大约两小时后，卖家称口罩已经卖给别人了。
About two hours later, the seller said the mask had been sold to someone else.
“这人是把我当成傻白甜了吗？”李野很生气。
"Is this man treating me like a fool?" Li No was angry.
李野买了4包一次性医用口罩，花了400元。
Li bought four bags of disposable medical masks, which cost 400 yuan.
受访者供图李野还遇到过一个卖家，表示可以提供1000个一次性医用口罩，但要交订金。
Respondents also met a seller who offered to supply 1,000 disposable medical masks for a down payment.
李野提出，交订金可以，但必须通过闲鱼等第三方平台交易。
Mr. Li argues that deposits can be made, but only through third-party platforms such as fish.
对方就此消失，再也没有回过消息。
The other party disappeared and never heard from again.
除了良莠不齐的卖家，口罩价格也是一天一变，甚至每小时都在变化。
In addition to the good and bad sellers, the price of masks is changing day by day, even hourly changes.
1月22日，李丹和朋友在上海某厂商处订购了300个N95口罩，单价7元。
On January 22, Li Dan and his friends ordered 300 N95 masks at a Shanghai manufacturer for $7 each.
第二天他们开车到上海取完货之后，厂家就把口罩的单价调到了15元。
The next day they drove to Shanghai to pick up the goods, the manufacturer adjusted the unit price of the mask to 15 yuan.
江宇也经历过类似的事。
Jiang Yu has gone through the same thing.
一次，他和人拼购了100个一次性医用口罩，单价5.6元。
Once, he and the person bought 100 disposable medical masks, the unit price is 5.6 yuan.
可一小时后，主导拼单的人说口罩被人以7元的单价“截和了”。
But an hour later, the person who dominates the collage said the mask was "cut off" at 7 yuan per unit price.
“真是瞬间即没啊！”江宇说。
"The moment is really no ah!" said Jiang Yu.
从那以后，无论卖家报出什么样的价格，江宇都会应下来。
From then on, no matter what price the seller quoted, Jiang Yu should come down.
“每一个都说‘行，都要’，因为一旦放手了，你就不知道它还能不能回来。
"Everyone says, 'Yes, all right,' because once you let go, you don't know if it will ever come back.
而且你今天觉得贵，说不定明天就觉得便宜了，因为更便宜的那个已经没货了。
And if you feel expensive today, you might find it cheaper tomorrow because the cheaper one is out of stock.
”在蒋坤看来，口罩价格飞涨的原因之一是销售过程中层层转手，层层加价。
In Chiang Kun's view, one of the reasons for the surging price of masks was that they were being sold at different levels and at different prices.
蒋坤记得，一名买家因为种种原因要为口罩申请退货。
Jiang remembered that a buyer had to apply for a return of the mask for a variety of reasons.
蒋坤同意了，让对方把寄回的快递单号发过来，对方却说自己把口罩转手了，单号在下家那里，要等一等。
Jiang Kun agreed, let the other party to send back the express delivery list number, the other side said he changed his mask, a single number in the next home, to wait.
轮到蒋坤退款时，他同样要拖延时间。
When it was Chiang Kun's turn to refund, he also delayed.
因为蒋坤的口罩也是从朋友那里拿的，要等朋友先把钱退给自己，自己才能退给买家。
Because Jiang Kun's mask is also taken from friends, to wait for a friend to return the money to themselves, before returning it to the buyer.
但朋友却迟迟不肯退钱，因为朋友在等着自己的上家先退款。
But the friend refused to return the money because he was waiting for a refund from his family.
“光是这一单，至少就经手了5个人。
"This alone has handled at least five people.
”蒋坤说，至于转手中途每个人加价多少，就看个人的想法了。
'As for how much each person raises halfway through the journey, it depends on his or her own thoughts.
