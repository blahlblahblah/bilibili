Source: Visual China Reporter # 1244; Tong Jun: "By the end of 2018, China had 168,100 kilometers of tollroad mileage, with an annual revenue of 555.24 billion yuan, and total expenditure of 962.18 billion yuan.
”在3月6日的发布会上，交通部运输部副部长刘小明表示，从2月17号高速公路免费通行以后，全国高速公路的车流量快速增长，3月5日达到了2654.4万辆次，每天大概减免了15亿的通行费。
In a news conference on March 6, Liu Xiaoming, deputy transport minister, said the nation's motorway traffic had increased rapidly since the free passage of the Feb. 17 expressway, reaching 26.544 million on March 5, reducing tolls by about 1.5 billion a day.
免收通行费为疫情防控提供了积极支持，但同时也对经营高速公路的公司造成了极大的影响。
The toll-free approach has provided active support for disease prevention and control, but it has also had a dramatic impact on the companies that run the highways.
高速公路公司作为收费公路的投资、建设、经营主体，收取通行费是维持其正常运转最主要的环节。
As the main body of investment, construction and management of toll road, toll collection is the most important link to maintain its normal operation.
高速公路公司承压据wind统计，高速公路公司的收入主要来自收取通行费，部分公司通行费占主营收入的比例超过九成，其中山东高速（600350.SH）的车辆通行费占到其主营业务收入的92.76%，粤高速A（000429.SZ）的车辆通行费占其主营业务收入的96.82%，吉林高速（601518.SH）的主营收入几乎全部来自通行费。
According to Wind, the highway company's revenue comes mainly from toll fees, some of which account for more than 90% of the main revenue, including 92.76% for Shandong High Speed (600329.SH), 96.82% for Guangdong High Speed A (000429.SZ), and almost all of Jilin Highway (601518.SH).
通常情况下，每年春节期间（除夕至初六）高速公路免收通行费。
Under normal circumstances, the expressway toll-free during the Spring Festival (New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the year).
今年出于疫情防控，国务院曾将免收通行费政策延至2月8日元宵节。
This year, due to the epidemic prevention and control, the State Council has extended the toll-free policy until Feb. 8 Lantern Festival.
后来为了更好地服务疫情防控工作，促进企业复工复产，决定在2月17日零时起至疫情防控工作结束，全国收费公路免收车辆通行费。
Later, in order to better serve the prevention and control of the epidemic and promote the resumption of business operations, it was decided that toll roads throughout the country would be exempted from toll collection fees from 0 p.m. on 17 February until the end of the epidemic prevention and control efforts.
2月17日距今已有24天，再加上2月2日春节假期结束后延长了6天免费政策，目前高速公路免收通行费的政策已经执行约1个月，这意味着经营收费公路的公司几乎损失了这一个月的全部收入，而公路保养等成本并没有减少。
Twenty-four days after 17 February, and the extension of the six-day free policy following the end of the Spring Festival on 2 February, the current toll-free highway policy has been in place for about a month, meaning that companies operating toll roads have lost almost all of their revenues for that month without reducing costs such as road maintenance.
粤高速A董秘告诉界面新闻，公司的困难很明显，虽然目前现金流还可以，但不知道还会持续多长时间。
Guangdong high-speed A secretary told the interface news, the company's difficulties are obvious, although the current cash flow is OK, but do not know how long it will last.
除了公司短期的现金流受到影响，另一方面减少了几个月的收入对公司也有长期影响。
In addition to the short-term cash flow of the company was affected, on the other hand, the reduction of income for several months has long-term impact on the company.
山东高速对界面新闻表示，短期内高速公路行业公司流动性会受到一定影响，山东高速将进一步压缩公司日常运营成本，加强全员节约意识，减少专项工程开支，同时正与银行沟通，协调降低贷款利率。
Shandong High Speed Interface News said that in the short term, the liquidity of the expressway industry will be affected. Shandong High Speed will further compress the company's daily operating costs, strengthen the sense of total savings and reduce the cost of special projects.
由于目前尚不确定免费政策延续的时间，也未知是否会具体出台何种配套保障政策，山东高速暂时无法预估此政策为公司带来的具体影响。
Due to the uncertainty about the continuation of the free policy, and whether there will be a specific supporting security policy, Shandong High Speed can not predict the specific impact of this policy on the company.
粤高速A在投资者互动平台上也有类似的表示，并称将严控成本费用，积极争取合理的政策支持。
Guangdong High Speed A made a similar statement on the Investor Interaction platform, saying it would aggressively control costs and actively seek sound policy support.
高速公路行业长期以来存在收支缺口，导致债务较高。
The highway industry has a long-standing income and expenditure gap, resulting in higher debt.
2018年末，全国收费公路里程16.81万公里，全年收入5552.4亿元，支出总额9621.8亿元，收支缺口4069.4亿元，整体债务余额为5.69万亿元。
By the end of 2018, China had 168,100 km of toll roads, with an annual revenue of 555.24 billion yuan and total expenditure of 962.18 billion yuan, leaving an overall debt balance of 5.69 trillion yuan.
西部证券研究员吴剑樑分析认为，若按2018年公路收费情况，减免1个月通行费对应的收入为462.7亿元，若政策执行到5月底，预计将减少约1800亿元收入，进一步增加公路债务负担。
Wu Jian, a member of the Western Securities Research Group, said that the revenue corresponding to a one-month toll relief of 46.27 billion yuan according to 2018 highway tolls is expected to decrease by about 180 billion yuan by the end of May, further increasing the road debt burden.
企业期待保障政策尽快出台在3月6日举行的发布会上，交通部运输部副部长刘小明表示，疫情防控期间收费公路免费通行政策，降低了物流运输的成本，也鼓励了自驾车的出行，降低了聚集性感染的风险，目前高速公路上的路网流量已经反超去年的同期水平。
Transportation Vice Minister Liu Xiaoming said the free toll road policy during the epidemic prevention and control had reduced logistics costs, encouraged self-driving and reduced the risk of concentrated infections, with highway network traffic surpassing the same period last year.
刘小明也表示，这项政策给疫情防控创造了条件，但也给广大公路经营主体带来了实际的困难和挑战，企业面临着债务本息偿还、运营维护刚性支出保障、合法收费权益补偿等问题。
Liu Xiaoming also said that this policy has created the conditions for disease prevention and control, but also brought practical difficulties and challenges to the vast majority of road operators, enterprises face debt repayment, operation and maintenance of rigid expenditure protection, legal fee compensation and other issues.
刘小明表示，已经会同有关部门研究制定了相关的支持保障政策。
Liu Xiaoming said that has worked with the relevant departments to develop relevant support for the safeguard policy.
主要包括：免费通行期间，对经营主体金融债务还本付息存在困难的给予延缓付息、本金展期或者续贷等政策，为企业提供流动资金的优惠贷款以及适当延长收费公路收费期限等方面，这些政策经批准以后会尽快实施，从而依法保障收费公路的使用者、管理者、投资者、债权人的合法权益。
These policies will be implemented as soon as they are approved, so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the users, managers, investors and creditors of toll roads.
交通部已明确要出台配套的保障政策，不过目前为止还没有具体措施公布。
The Ministry of Transport has made it clear that it will put in place safeguards, but so far no specific measures have been announced.
粤高速A董秘告诉界面新闻，公司大股东受影响会比较大。
Guangdong high-speed A secretary told the interface news, the company's major shareholders will be more affected.
“这不是单一家公司的问题，而是行业面临的共性问题，希望政策能够尽快出台。
"This is not a problem for a single company, it is a common problem facing the industry and it is hoped that policies will be put in place soon."
”他说。
'he said.
除了上述交通部提到的保障措施，山东高速对界面新闻表示，还希望能尽快完善收费公路联网收费运营系统和服务规则，加快跨省收费业务通行费清分结算速度；同时建议加快基础设施建设批复速度，缩短工程建设总时长，尽快建成通车，实现营业收入。
In addition to the above-mentioned safeguards mentioned by the Ministry of Communications, Shandong High-Speed Interface News also hopes to improve toll road toll collection and operation system and service rules as soon as possible so as to speed up toll clearing and settlement of toll fees for toll collection business.
国务院明确，免费通行政策将执行到疫情防控工作结束之际。
The State Council has made it clear that the free passage policy will continue until the end of epidemic prevention and control.
交通部印发给各省份的通知显示，暂定的结束时间为6月30日，根据疫情变化有可能提前或延后。
Notices issued by the Ministry of Transport to the provinces indicate a tentative end date of 30 June, with the possibility of an early or delayed response to the epidemic.
目前全国疫情防控工作取得了积极成效，绝大部分省份已连续多日没有新增病例，疫情的缓解有可能提前结束免收通行费这一政策。
At present, the national epidemic prevention and control work has achieved positive results, the vast majority of provinces have not been new cases for many days, the alleviation of the epidemic may end the policy of toll exemption ahead of time.
