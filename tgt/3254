美股这几天的表现如过山车一般。
U. S. stocks have been on a roller coaster for days.
前天晚上，美股道琼斯指数刚刚杀跌2000点。
The night before yesterday, the Dow Jones index just fell 2,000 points.
昨晚，道指又现1300点幅度的巨震，最终收涨1100点以上。
Last night, the Dow was hit by a 1300-point jolt that ended up more than 1,100 points higher.
美股大涨的背后，是特朗普在背后使劲。
Behind the surge in US stocks is Trump's backlash.
一方面，敦促美联储进一步实施宽松货币政策，同时，据报道，特朗普表示，正在准备实施重大的经济措施，商议快速出台包括“零工资税”等财政政策措施，帮助企业应对新冠肺炎疫情暴发带来的影响。
While urging the Fed to further ease monetary policy, Trump reportedly said he was preparing to implement significant economic measures and negotiate a quick fiscal policy package, including a "zero-wage tax," to help businesses deal with the impact of the outbreak of pneumonia in the New Crown.

图片来源：新浪微博@人民日报告别暴跌美国三大股指10日大幅上涨据央视新闻，当地时间3月10日，由于投资者受到政府可能出台救市措施（针对新冠疫情对经济的冲击）的刺激，美股于周二大幅上涨。
2007-9-25 21: 48 U.S. stocks surged on Tuesday as investors were braced for a possible government bailout of the economy in the wake of the new crown shock, CCTV reported Tuesday.
当日开盘，道指涨3.2%，标普500涨3.1%，纳指涨3.4%；而美股石油股普涨，卡隆石油涨66.37%，西方石油涨27.34%，埃克森美孚涨9.91%，道达尔涨6.79%。

市场分析师认为，美国政府的财政政策可以抵消部分新冠肺炎疫情及原油价格带来的冲击，但无法解决这些问题。
Market analysts said the U.S. government's fiscal policy could offset some of the shocks from the outbreak of pneumonia and crude oil prices, but it would not solve those problems.
美国总统特朗普在3月9日提出工资税减免想法，并计划在10日晚些时候公布具体政策，包括对于特定行业的税收优惠等。
US President Trump introduced the idea of payroll-tax cuts on March 9, and plans to announce specific policies later today, including tax breaks for specific industries.
目前各方仍在观察美国政府会推出怎样的政策来缓解当前市场焦虑。
It remains to be seen what policies the US government will put in place to ease current market anxiety.
3月9日，美股市场经历了历史性的抛售，道指及标普500指数重挫7.8%和7.6%，成为自2008年以来最糟糕的一天。
On March 9, the U.S. stock market suffered a historic sell-off, with the Dow and S & P 500 down 7.8% and 7.6%, the worst day since 2008.
道指大跌2014点，录得史上最大跌幅。
The Dow plunged by 2014, the biggest drop ever recorded.
由于油价和新冠疫情影响，美股大跌触发熔断机制，在9日开盘不久即停止交易15分钟。
Because of the oil price and the new crown epidemic, U.S. stocks fell sharply triggering the meltdown mechanism, trading stopped for 15 minutes shortly after the start of trading on the 9th.
与此同时，10日油价有所上涨，美国西德州石油期货价格上涨7.7%至每桶34.36美元。
Meanwhile, oil prices rose on the 10th, with West German oil futures rising 7.7 per cent to $34.36 a barrel.
上周末，由于多国对于石油减产未能达成一致，并增产石油，导致出现油价竞争。
This past weekend, competition for oil prices began after several countries failed to agree on a cut in oil production and increased production.
9日全球油价经历了1991年海湾战争以来最大跌幅的一天。
Global oil prices suffered their biggest one-day drop since the 1991 Gulf War.
美国国债收益率在10日有所反弹，10年期国债收益率在0.6%以上徘徊，30年期国债收益率则回升至1%。
Treasury yields rebounded on the 10th, with 10-year Treasury yields hovering above 0.6% and 30-year Treasury yields rebounding to 1%.
美股暴跌后白宫请华尔街巨头开了个会据央视新闻，3月9日，美股暴跌之后，白宫紧急邀请华尔街金融机构的高管开会。
The White House has invited Wall Street chiefs to a meeting following the collapse of U.S. stocks on March 9, according to CCTV.
据称，受邀的都是具有“全球系统重要性的金融机构”，包括摩根大通、美国银行、摩根斯坦利、高盛等，在2008年金融危机时，这些机构也被称作“大而不能倒”，可见其重要性。
All were said to be "systemically important globally important institutions," including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which were also referred to as "too big to fail" during the 2008 financial crisis.
位于股灾风暴中心的华尔街一举一动都备受舆论关注，不过这次会议究竟讨论了什么却不为人知，参加会议的人也拒绝置评。
Wall Street, at the epicentre of the stock-market crash, was caught in the limelight, but what was discussed at the meeting was not known, and attendees declined to comment.
有美国媒体猜测，它们谈的是如何控制金融风险。
American media have speculated that they are talking about how to control financial risk.
因为在经济下行的情况下，一旦出现大范围失业将会导致信用卡、抵押贷款等金融产品的违约率上升。
Because in a downturn, widespread unemployment will lead to higher default rates for financial products such as credit cards and mortgages.
要为最坏的情况作好准备，这也有先例。
There are precedents for preparing for the worst.
在大萧条期间，美国政府曾出面要求银行与借贷方协调解决贷款违约问题，而不是强制清算，以避免对经济产生恶性的连锁反应。
During the Great Depression, the US government called on banks to coordinate with borrowers to resolve loan defaults, rather than to force liquidation, in order to avoid a vicious chain reaction to the economy.
这几周来，随着股市的剧烈波动，市场上充斥着关于美国疫情的种种分析和传言。
Over the past few weeks, the market has been rife with analysis and rumors of an epidemic in the United States as the stock market has fluctuated wildly.
美国总统特朗普则怒斥这些“假新闻”造成了恐慌。
US President Trump has denounced these "false news" as creating panic.
《华尔街日报》称，美国政府试图对外展现乐观态度，以防恐慌情绪影响经济，但包括股市、债市的反应却似乎在告诉人们经济衰退不可避免。
The Wall Street Journal said the U.S. government is trying to be optimistic in case panic infects the economy, but the reaction, including from stocks and bond markets, seems to be telling people that a recession is inevitable.
在这个问题的判断上，“主街”与“华尔街”终于形成了一致，人们的反应是囤积卫生纸和罐装食品以备不时之需（编者注：主街Main street指小企业或小人物，常被用来与Wall street代表的大金融资本形成对比）。
In judging the problem, "Main Street" and "Wall Street" have finally come together, and people have responded by hoarding toilet paper and canned food in case of need (Editor's Note: Main Street Mainstream refers to small businesses or small people, often contrasted with the big financial capital represented by Wall Street).
美国政府面临巨大压力，急需给市场恢复信心，特朗普和政府高官都承诺将尽快推出经济刺激措施。
With the US government under intense pressure to restore confidence, Trump and senior administration officials have pledged to launch stimulus measures as soon as possible.
为此，特朗普10日赴国会与共和党议员召开午餐会，据彭博社透露，这次会议的主题很明确，特朗普在会上表示，他要在11月份大选前取消工资税，确保税收在大选投票前不上涨，同时将为受疫情打击的行业提供纾困计划。
To that end, Trump went to Congress for a luncheon with Republican lawmakers on the 10th, which, Bloomberg said, had a clear theme, saying he would eliminate payroll taxes ahead of the November election, ensure that taxes do not rise before the general election vote, and provide a bailout plan for industries hit by the epidemic.
不过，这些措施要想通过国会还需要民主党的配合，现在看还是有难度的。
Still, it will be difficult to get these measures through Congress without the cooperation of Democrats.
众议长佩洛希就表示“我们本周不一定能准备好”，这让特朗普十分愤怒；另一边，参议院民主党领袖舒默对减税也不感兴趣，他认为，政府应该抓重点，即保证感染新冠肺炎人员的带薪病假并扩大失业保险范围。
Trump is outraged by Speaker Pelosi's statement that "we may not be ready this week"; on the other hand, Senate Democratic Leader Sean Schumer is not interested in tax cuts, arguing that the government should focus on guaranteeing paid sick leave for people infected with pneumonia and extending unemployment insurance.
有市场分析人士就认为，财政政策远水解不了近渴，现在恐怕还是要指望美联储有更大举动。
Some market analysts argue that fiscal policy is too far away to satisfy thirst, and that the Fed may now be expected to do more.
所以，特朗普10日继续在社交媒体上催促鲍威尔：“行动迟缓的美联储应该把利率降到其他竞争对手一样的水平上。
So Trump continued to press Powell on social media on the 10th: "The sluggish Fed should lower interest rates to the same level as its competitors."
”美国新冠肺炎确诊病例超过1000例中国境内首次出现美国输入病例值得注意的是，据北京市卫生健康委， 3月10日0时至24时，北京新增报告新冠肺炎确诊病例6例，均为境外输入病例，其中5例为意大利输入病例，1例为美国输入病例。
More than 1,000 confirmed cases of Newly Coronary Pneumonia in the United States The first confirmed cases in the United States are worth noting, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission between 0000 and 2400 hours on March 10.
这也是中国内地首次出现美国输入病例。
It is also the first case of U. S. imports from the mainland.

As of 2300 local time, the number of confirmed cases of pneumonia in the United States rose to 1,004, with a cumulative total of 31 deaths, the New York Times was quoted as saying.
此外，当地时间3月10日，纽约州州长科莫举行发布会，更新纽约州新冠疫情情势。

目前纽约州确诊新冠肺炎患者总数达到了173人，其中韦斯特切斯特确诊患者突破100人。
A total of 173 new cases of pneumonia have been confirmed in New York state, including more than 100 confirmed cases in Westchester.
科莫当天宣布了一系列针对疫情最严重的地区——新罗谢尔（New Rochelle）——的措施：这些措施包括向当地卫生署指挥点部署国民警卫队，建立卫星测试点和在城区内建立控制区。
Komo announced a series of measures targeting New Rochelle, the worst affected region: the deployment of the National Guard to local Department of Health command, the establishment of satellite testing sites, and the establishment of control areas within urban areas.
据了解，控制区半径为1.6公里，该控制区内的所有学校及设施将从3月12日到25日全面关闭，国民警卫队将进行协助上门递送食品并清洁公共区域。
The zone is known to have a radius of 1.6 km, with all schools and facilities in the zone to be fully closed from 12 to 25 March, with National Guard assistance for door-to-door food deliveries and the cleaning of public areas.
目前该计划将持续到3月25日。
The plan now runs until 25 March.
纽约、新泽西、康涅狄格三州新冠肺炎确诊数据图图片来源：央视新闻新罗谢尔所在的韦斯特切斯特目前新冠肺炎确诊人数达到108人，占新泽西、纽约和康涅狄格三州的58%。
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut Diagnostic Data Source: CCTV News Westchester, New Jersey, has 108 confirmed new cases of pneumonia, or 58 percent of the states of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.
新罗谢尔是纽约州首个“社区传播”病例，该名50多岁律师被证实与韦斯特切斯特及多名纽约感染者相关。
New Rochelle is the first New York state case of "community transmission," and the 50-year-old lawyer has been linked to Westchester and a number of New Yorkers.
据悉，纽约市感染人数在一夜之间翻倍，从18例增长到了36例。
The number of New York City infections is reported to have doubled overnight, from 18 to 36.
