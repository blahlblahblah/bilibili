随着伊朗病例的大幅增加，中东疫情也在逐步扩散。
As the number of cases in Iran has increased dramatically, the Middle East epidemic is spreading.
世卫组织担心新冠病毒在卫生系统薄弱的国家蔓延。
WHO is concerned about the spread of the new cap virus in countries with weak health systems.
”随着新冠肺炎疫情在全球蔓延，本周，疫情正进一步朝欧洲与中东扩散。
The outbreak is spreading further into Europe and the Middle East this week as the global outbreak of new crown pneumonia spreads.
意大利卫生部长罗伯托·斯佩兰萨（Roberto Speranza）2月21日说，意大利出现了首例新冠肺炎死亡病例，并且正在出现德国及法国已有的本地人传人感染群。
Roberto Speranza, Italy's health minister, said on Feb. 21 that Italy had its first case of death from pneumonia and was experiencing the emergence of native-to-human transmission in Germany and France.
综合美联社、路透社及法新社报道，当天，意大利北部地区共新增17例新冠病毒肺炎感染病例，累计确诊达20例，还有一位在威尼托大区确诊的78岁男性在北部城市帕多瓦死亡，为意大利境内首例、欧洲第二例新冠肺炎死亡病例。
The AP, Reuters and AFP reported 17 new cases of pneumonia in northern Italy, with a cumulative total of 20 confirmed cases, and a 78-year-old man in the northern city of Padua died, the first death in Italy and the second in Europe.
根据目前了解到的信息，这些新增病例均未有中国旅行史。
According to information received so far, none of the new cases has a history of travel to China.
其中，有15例来自威尼托大区以西的伦巴第大区，2例来自威尼托大区，感染源未明。
Of these, 15 were from Lombardy, west of the region of Veneto, and two from the region of Veneto, with unknown sources of infection.
这意味着意大利已出现了二代传播的感染途径，该国在1月30日已停飞了所有往返中国的航班。
That means a second-generation transmission route has emerged in Italy, which stopped all flights to and from China on January 30.
其此前确诊的3例病例中，有2例为武汉抵意的中国游客，1例为意大利人，后者经两周抗病毒治疗，其多次检测结果已呈阴性。
Of the three previously diagnosed cases, two were Chinese tourists and one Italian, who tested negative for two weeks of antiviral treatment.
伦巴第大区卫生部长朱利奥·加莱拉（Giulio Gallera）指出，新增病例所属的感染群，主要位于米兰以东南的几个小镇，其出现在“预料之中”。
Giulio Gallera, the minister of health of Lombardy, said the new cases were "predictably" infected, mainly in small towns southeast of Milan.
据了解，该地区首例感染病例是一名38岁的意大利男性，他曾与一个1月21日自中国返意的人见面，但后者当时并未表现出任何疑似症状。
The first case in the area is known to be a 38-year-old Italian man who met a man who returned from China on January 21 but did not show any symptoms at the time.
当地卫生部门称，后者正在接受隔离，似乎对病毒存在抗体，或为已病愈的无症状感染者。
Local health authorities say the latter are being quarantined and appear to have antibodies to the virus or for asymptomatic infected people who have recovered.
目前，上述38岁意大利男性正在医院接受治疗，病情危重，其怀孕8个月的妻子及其一位朋友的病毒检测结果亦呈阳性。
The 38-year-old Italian man is being treated in a hospital and is in critical condition. His wife, who is eight months pregnant, and a friend tested positive for the virus.
据了解，该朋友是其跑友及球友，其父亲在当地开有一家酒吧，该酒吧也有3名高龄常客感染。
The friend is known to be a running friend and a pal whose father runs a bar in the area where three senior regulars are also infected.
另外，上述38岁病例2月18日曾因出现流感症状在伦巴第大区洛迪省科多尼奥的一家医院就诊，目前该医院已有3名病人以及5名医护人员感染，医院的急诊室已经关闭。
In addition, the 38-year-old case was treated on 18 February at a hospital in Cotonio, Lodi province, Lombardy district, for which three patients and five medical staff were infected and the hospital's emergency room was closed.
红圈为伦巴第大区，蓝圈为科多尼奥美联社称，目前，卫生部门正在追踪该病例接触的一名医生是否已经感染，该医生曾上门为该病例看病。
The Red Circle is Lombardy, and the Blue Circle is Cordonio. The Associated Press says health authorities are tracking whether a doctor contacted by the case, who visited the case at his home, has been infected.
此外，该病例还曾在洛迪省卡萨尔普斯泰伦戈的联合利华分部研发部门与约120人有过接触。
In addition, the case had been contacted by the research and development unit of the Unilever branch in Casalpstelengo, department of Lodi, with approximately 120 people.
意大利卫生部长斯佩兰萨说，这意味着意大利正在出现德国及法国已有的本地人传人感染群。
Italian Health Minister Fabio Speransa says this means Italy is seeing the emergence of native-to-human infections that already exist in Germany and France.
他已与伦巴第大区主席签署了一项法令，列出了遏制疫情扩散的相关措施。
He has signed a decree with the President of the Lombardy region setting out measures to curb the spread of the epidemic.
截至目前，该感染群已涉及10个城镇，包括科多尼奥、阿达堡、卡萨尔普斯泰伦戈、马莱奥、丰比奥、贝尔托尼科、卡斯泰尔格伦多、泰拉诺瓦德伊帕塞里尼、索玛利亚、圣菲奥拉诺。
To date, the infection group has affected 10 towns, including Cotonio, Adalborg, Casalpo Stelengo, Maleo, Fonbio, Bertonico, Castellando, Tiranobad Ipaserini, Somalia and San Fiorano.
这些城镇的人口规模最小为1000人，最大达1.5万人（科多尼奥），均位于米兰以东南60公里附近。
These towns, with a population ranging from 1,000 to a maximum of 15,000 (Kodoño), are located approximately 60 kilometres south-east of Milan.
斯佩兰萨表示，法令将禁止这些地区举行任何公众集会，以及其他商业、体育、教育、娱乐及宗教活动。
Speransa said the decree would prohibit all public meetings, as well as other commercial, sporting, educational, recreational and religious activities in those areas.
据法新社报道，禁令为期一周，在此期间，这些城镇的学校、酒吧等公共场所也将关闭。
Schools, bars and other public places in the towns will also be closed during the week-long ban, AFP reported.
意大利卫生部门已要求所有曾与病例直接接触过的人隔离14天，并建议伦巴第大区的居民不要外出。
The Italian health authorities have requested the isolation of all persons who have been in direct contact with cases for 14 days and have advised the inhabitants of Lombardy not to go out.
意大利总理孔特则表示，“一切尽在控制之中”，并强调政府一直处于高度防备状态。
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Conte said "everything is under control" and stressed that the government had been on high alert.
但目前，意大利多地的口罩供应已十分紧张，意大利民事保护署则正在寻找可改为隔离病房的军事建筑及酒店等设施。
But supplies of masks are already tight in many parts of Italy, and the Italian Civil Protection Agency is looking for facilities such as military buildings and hotels that could be converted into isolation wards.
与意大利一样迎来疫情爆发的还有中东国家伊朗。
As in Italy, the Middle Eastern countries like Iran are experiencing an outbreak.
据路透社报道，伊朗卫生部发言人贾努什·贾汉普尔（Kianush Jahanpur）21日说，伊朗当天新增13例确诊病例，其中7人来自库姆，另有4人在德黑兰，其余2人在吉兰，累计确诊达18例，累计死亡达4例，其中至少2例来自库姆。
Iran's health ministry spokesman, Kianush Jahanpur, said Monday that 13 new cases were confirmed, including seven in Qom, four in Tehran and two in Gilan, with a cumulative total of 18 confirmed cases, including at least two in Qom.
红点为库姆市值得注意的是，英国广播公司（BBC）19日援引伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社（IRNA）的报道称，这两人在去世之前未曾出过国，甚至没有出过库姆省。
The city of Qom is noted that the BBC quoted Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as saying that the two men had not left the country before their death, or even outside the province of Qom.
伊朗卫生部官员米诺·莫瑞兹（Minou Mohrez）表示，根据现有报告，病毒从库姆开始传播，追踪患者活动轨迹可以发现，病毒现已到达包括德黑兰、巴博勒、阿拉克、伊斯法罕、拉什特等在内的其他城市，“很可能，伊朗的所有城市都存在病毒。
Minou Mohrez, an official with the Iranian health ministry, said that, according to available reports, the virus had spread from Qom, tracking the movement of patients and finding that the virus had now reached other cities, including Tehran, Babol, Arak, Isfahan and Lasht. "It is likely that all cities in Iran have the virus.
”莫瑞兹猜测，新冠病毒的源头或为在库姆工作、期间回过中国的中国工人。
Mr Moritz speculated that the source of the new cap virus was Chinese workers who had returned to China while working in Qom.
库姆位于伊朗首都德黑兰以南约140公里处，是一个受欢迎的宗教目的地。
Qom, about 140 kilometers south of Tehran, is a popular religious destination.
目前，该市的所有学校均已关闭，卫生部已呼吁暂停该市的所有宗教集会活动，在该市的议会选举投票活动中，选民也都戴上了口罩。
All schools in the city have now been closed, and the Ministry of Health has called for the suspension of all religious gatherings in the city, and voters have worn masks during the city's parliamentary elections.
除伊朗外，中东地区出现确诊病例的国家还有阿联酋、埃及、以色列和黎巴嫩。
In addition to Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Israel and Lebanon are among the countries in the Middle East with confirmed cases.
其中，阿联酋确诊11例，埃及1例，以色列1例，黎巴嫩1例。
Of these, 11 cases were diagnosed in the United Arab Emirates, one in Egypt, one in Israel and one in Lebanon.
在黎巴嫩被确诊的45岁女性曾去过伊朗。
The 45-year-old woman diagnosed in Lebanon has been to Iran.
世卫组织已对此表示关切，总干事谭德塞21日在日内瓦的记者会上表示，世卫组织仍然担忧新冠病毒有可能在卫生系统薄弱的国家蔓延，已向伊朗方面提供了检测包，今后将继续提供更多支持。
The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern about the possible spread of the virus in countries with weak health systems, and has provided testing kits to the Iranian side and will continue to provide more support in the future.
谭德塞强调，中国和其他国家采取的措施为世界遏制病毒的传播争取到了难得的机会，他呼吁各国继续采取防控措施，同时为可能发生社区传播做好准备，绝不能在今后回首往事时，后悔未能充分利用现有的“机会之窗”。
Mr. Tan stressed that the measures taken by China and other countries present a unique opportunity for the world to curb the spread of the virus. He called on countries to continue to take control measures while preparing for possible community transmission and not to look back in the future with regret for not making full use of the existing "window of opportunity."
