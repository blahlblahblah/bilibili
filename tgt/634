编者按：8天时间，一座可容纳1000张床位的医院正式落成。
Editor's Note: A 1000-bed hospital was inaugurated in eight days.
这就是参照2003年非典期间北京小汤山医院所建的火神山医院。
This is based on the 2003 SARS period in Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital built by the god of fire hospital.
明天，这所医院就将收治病人。
The hospital will take in patients tomorrow.
据悉，该医院主要救治确诊患者，开设重症监护病区、重症病区、普通病区，设置感染控制、检验、特诊、放射诊断等辅助科室。
It is reported that the hospital mainly treats confirmed patients, opened serious care, serious diseases, common disease areas, set up infection control, testing, special consultation, radiological diagnosis and other auxiliary departments.
《新民周刊》专访了麻醉专家熊利泽。
Xinmin Weekly interviewed Xiong Lize, an anesthesiologist.
2003年，麻醉专家熊利泽临危受命，担任第四军医大学赴京医疗队队长带领医疗队支援北京小汤山医院，任小汤山医院重症监护室主任。
In 2003, anaesthesiologist Xiong Liezhe was instructed to lead a medical team from the Fourth Military Medical University to Beijing to support the Xiaotangshan Hospital and serve as director of the intensive care unit of Xiaotangshan Hospital.
7天时间平地而起的小汤山非典医院收治了全国七分之一的患者，最终患者治愈率99%，1383名医护人员零感染，被世卫组织称为“奇迹”。
The 7-day-old Xiaotangshan SARS Hospital treated one in seven people in the country, with a final case recovery rate of 99 percent.
文 | 黄　祺熊利泽，现任上海市第四人民医院院长临时医院将很大程度缓解武汉救治压力新民周刊：武汉火神山医院、雷神山医院很快就要投入运转，非典时期您在小汤山医院担任要职，从您的经验看，目前两个临时医院建成后，将在多大程度上缓解救治压力？熊利泽：武汉很快就决定建设两个临时医院，被称为武汉的“小汤山医院”，说明政府决心很大。
From your experience, how quickly Wuhan, now the director of Shanghai's Fourth People's Hospital, will ease the pressure of treatment in Wuhan: Wuhan's Mount Huoshen Hospital and Lei Shenshan Hospital will soon become operational.
我的老领导、小汤山医院当时的院长张雁灵现在也在现场指导建设工作。
My old leader, Dean Zhang Yanling of Xiaotangshan Hospital, is also guiding the construction work on the spot.
2003年非典时期担任北京小汤山医院院长的张雁灵　图 | 熊利泽提供我没办法给个确切的数字来预测这两所医院能多大程度缓解救治压力，但根据非典时期的经验，我可以说将很大程度缓解压力。
As Director of Beijing's Xiaotangshan Hospital in 2003, Xiong Yanling provided me with no precise figures to predict how much relief the two hospitals will be able to provide, but based on the SARS experience, I can say that this will go a long way towards relieving the stress.
这个结论可以从几个方面理解：首先，据我了解武汉很多医院目前压力非常大，患者太多，存在院内交叉感染的风险。
To begin with, I understand that many hospitals in Wuhan are under severe pressure, with too many patients, and there is a risk of cross-infection in the hospital.
如果这些患者收治到临时医院，将很大程度上缓解现有医院的压力，否则医院里一直有交叉感染的话，患者人数会不断增加。
If these patients are admitted to temporary hospitals, the pressure on existing hospitals will be greatly alleviated, otherwise the number of patients will continue to increase if there are cross-infections in hospitals.
第二，临时医院能够有一个示范效应。
Second, temporary hospitals can have a demonstration effect.
我们从公布的数据可以看出，目前武汉新冠患者出院病人不多。
We can see from the published data that at present Wuhan Xinguan patients discharged from the hospital are not many.
临时医院由军队派出的医疗队接管后，他们有检测能力，可以根据相关指南让一部分符合出院标准的治愈病人出院。
After the temporary hospital is taken over by a medical team from the army, they have the ability to test and discharge some of the cured patients who meet the discharge criteria in accordance with the relevant guidelines.
这样，病人流转起来，宝贵的医疗资源就能用到最重的病人身上，医院能收治更多需要治疗的病人。
As a result, valuable medical resources are transferred to the heaviest patients, and hospitals are able to take in more patients in need of treatment.
临时医院启用后更重要的作用是减少社会恐慌情绪。
The more important role of the temporary hospital after its opening is to reduce social panic.
根据小汤山医院的经验，临时医院启用后治愈率会提高，死亡率减少，那么公众的恐慌就会缓解。
In the experience of Xiaotangshan Hospital, when temporary hospitals are opened, the cure rate will increase and the mortality rate will decrease, and the public panic will ease.
武汉火神山医院建设过程备受关注所以至少从我个人判断，我对这两家临时医院寄予厚望。
Wuhan Fosen Mountain Hospital construction process has attracted much attention so at least from my personal judgement, I have high hopes for the two temporary hospitals.
如果光从床位数看，你可能觉得2000多张床位不是很快就住满吗？其实不是这样的。
If you look at the number of beds alone, you probably don't think more than 2,000 beds will fill up very soon.
就像打仗，有的特种部队人数不多，但起到的作用很大。
Like fighting, some special forces are small in number but play a big role.
新民周刊：两个临时医院将由军医系统接手，我们军队医疗力量在这样的疫情中，有哪些优势？空军军医大学（西安），陆军军医大学（重庆），海军军医大学（上海），以及三所军医大附属医院抽调医护力量支援武汉熊利泽：军队的医疗力量，首先是执行力非常强，医护人员会按照要求和标准来防护、治疗。
Air Force Medical University (Xi'an), Army Military Medical University (Chongqing), Navy Military Medical University (Shanghai), and three military medical university affiliated hospitals to support Wuhan Xiong Lize Ze: The medical force of the army is first and foremost very effective, and medical personnel will be protected and treated according to the requirements and standards.
他们平常就有备战的训练，所以磨合的时间会比较短，可以迅速地投入救治。
They usually have the training to prepare for the war, so wear the time will be relatively short, can be quickly put into treatment.
而且军队医疗系统本身在灾难医学上，在成体系的救援上具有丰富的经验，传染病这样的公共卫生事件中，比如非典、非洲埃博拉疫情的支援上，军队医疗系统培训了很多专业人才。
Moreover, the military medical system itself has rich experience in disaster medicine and systematic rescue. In public health events such as SARS and Ebola in Africa, the military medical system has trained many professionals.
军队医疗系统还有一个特点，一旦出动，架构会很完整。
Another feature of the military medical system is that once deployed, the structure is complete.
比如他们会带自己的检测人员、检测设备，弥补目前武汉救治能力的不足。
For example, they will bring their own detection personnel, testing equipment, to make up for the current Wuhan treatment capacity.
小汤山经验：医护人员个人防护放在第一位新民周刊：小汤山医院“高治愈率、低死亡率”，医护人员没有感染的情况。
Xiaotangshan experience: Medical personnel personal protection in the first Xinmin Weekly: Xiaotangshan Hospital "high cure rate, low mortality", no cases of infection among medical personnel.
请您介绍一下当时最重要的经验是什么？熊利泽：小汤山医院最重要的经验，就是感控做得非常好。
What was the most important experience at that time? Xiong Lize: The most important experience of Xiaotangshan Hospital is that the sensibility is very good.
一个副院长带队，成立了20多人组成的督导团队，专门管医护人员的个人防护，对医院交叉感染的风险进行管控。
A vice-president led a team of more than 20 people to oversee the personal protection of health-care workers and control the risk of cross-infection in hospitals.
图 | 熊利泽提供在小汤山医院正式运转前，我们所有人员做了充分的培训，并不是说医院一建好就马上开始收治病人。
Not that the hospital started receiving patients as soon as it was built, all of us were adequately trained before it was fully operational.
我记得有几天时间，我们做了很多培训，培训怎么做防护，要求医护人员绝对不能感染，如果医护人员感染那是非常危险的。
I remember that for a few days, we had a lot of training on how to protect yourself from infection. It was very dangerous for health care workers to get infected.
当时小汤山医院把医护人员的个人防护放到了最重要的位置。
At that time, Xiaotangshan Hospital put the personal protection of medical personnel in the most important position.
比如说我们尽量减少开会，如果开会不允许在室内开会。
We try to keep meetings to a minimum, for example, and we don't allow meetings indoors.
我记得北京市政府给大家配备了“小灵通”，那时候“小灵通”信号不怎么好。
I remember that the Beijing Municipal Government equipped everyone with a "little PHS", when the "little PHS" signal was not very good.
我们有个顺口溜：“站在风雨中，手持小灵通，昂着头挺着胸，就是打不通。
We have a slip of the tongue: "Stand in the wind and rain, holding a small well-informed, holding your head open chest, is not open.
”现在通信手段好多了，可以利用这些工具开会。
Communications are much better now, and these tools can be used for meetings.
另外那时候后勤保障做得很好。
At the other end of the day, logistics were good.
图 | 熊利泽提供另外，我们成立了一个专家组，我也是专家组的成员。
In addition, we have established a group of experts, of which I am a member.
如果出现疑难病例，都是专家组会诊解决的，这对于提高治愈率起到了关键的作用。
In the case of problematic cases, expert group consultations were conducted, which played a key role in improving the cure rate.
新民周刊：临时医院条件毕竟不能像正式的医院一样完备，您对武汉两座临时医院未来的运转，有些什么提醒？熊利泽：尽管现在的临时医院肯定比17年前硬件条件好很多，但跟正规医院还是不能比。
What do you warn about the future operation of Wuhan's two makeshift hospitals Although temporary hospitals are certainly much better than 17 years ago in terms of hardware, they are no match for a regular hospital.
比如保温不知道是不是做得好，因为武汉现在气温还是比较低。
For example, heat preservation is not well done, because Wuhan is still relatively low temperature.
还有一个问题，不知道医护人员宿舍这次放在什么地方。
One more question. I don't know where the staff dormitory will be this time.
北京小汤山医院建设时，考虑到传染风险，工作人员住宿的地方离医院比较远，上班必须靠车。
Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital construction, taking into account the risk of infection, staff accommodation away from the hospital, must rely on the car to work.
现在我们对病毒的传播能力有了比较多的了解，我们知道宿舍和医院其实没有必要距离那么远。
Now that we have a better understanding of the spread of the virus, we know that dormitories and hospitals do not have to be that far away.
17年过去，疫情控制能力肯定提高了新民周刊：非典过去17年，您认为这次新冠疫情的控制，哪些方面是有进步的？哪些还需加强？熊利泽：17年的时间，科学对疾病的认识已经有了很大的进步，对于这次新冠疫情的控制，我们更有信心。
Seventeen years on, the ability to control the outbreak has certainly improved Newsweek: What do you think has improved in the last 17 years of SARS control? Xiong Lize: Scientific understanding of disease has improved greatly in 17 years.
我们医疗队当时出发去小汤山医院的时候，坐上车大家都在哭。
When our medical team left for Xiaotangshan Hospital, everyone was crying in the car.
为什么呢？因为非典中死亡的病人中三分之一是医护人员，大家听到的消息都是医护人员在牺牲。
Because one-third of all deaths in SARS occur among health-care workers, the news is that health-care workers are dying.
那时对病毒完全不了解，疫情到底能不能被控制住，大家没底，大家都想，去小汤山一年能回来吗？但这一次，我们已经可以认识到疫情是可以控制住的，我们讨论时间的时候是用“月”做单位，这就是最大的进步。
At that time, the virus was completely unknown, whether the epidemic can be controlled, we do not know, we all want to go to Xiaotangshan a year back? But this time, we can realize that the epidemic can be controlled, we discuss the time using the "month" as a unit, which is the greatest progress.
从治疗上，因为没有特效药，当时给非典病人用了大量的激素，后来导致了严重的后遗症。
In terms of treatment, as there was no specific drug, SARS patients were given a large amount of hormone, which later led to serious sequelae.
但这一次的治疗，我们从一开始就没有大量用激素。
But this time around, we didn't use a lot of hormones in the first place.
我们的医疗条件17年进步很大，治疗手段比当初好很多，尽管大家对这次疫情控制有批评，但我们也要看到这些进步的地方。
Our health care has improved over the past 17 years, and the treatment is much better than it used to be.
建议迅速关闭能力不足的发热门诊新民周刊：这次疫情与非典相比有什么特别不一样的地方？您对目前的防控措施有没有什么建议？熊利泽：这次新冠肺炎的特点是潜伏期长，赶上春节假期，大家都出发到各地去了。
It is recommended to close the fever clinic Xinmin Weekly with insufficient capacity quickly: What are the special differences between this outbreak and SARS? Do you have any suggestions on the current control measures? Xiong Lize: The new crown pneumonia is characterized by a long incubation period to catch up with the Spring Festival holiday.
早期这些人员的流动，造成全国都有了病人，大家非常紧张。
The early movement of these people resulted in the presence of patients throughout the country and was a source of great tension.
非典疫情虽然也波及全国，但主要还是在几个重点区域疫情比较严重。
Although SARS epidemic also affects the whole country, it is still more serious in several key areas.
防控的建议，我认为应该有更多的流行病学专家参与到政府决策中。
On prevention and control, I think there should be more epidemiologists involved in government decision-making.
现在我们打的是“人民战争”，这是我们国家的优势，这是值得赞赏的。
Now we are fighting a people's war, which is a great strength for our country, and that is commendable.
但我们也要依靠科学的策略，这个就要依靠专业人员，需要流行病学专家出谋划策。
But we also rely on scientific strategies, which rely on professionals and the advice of epidemiologists.
另外我要呼吁防控中不要歧视病人，更不能歧视疾病高发地区的人。
I would also like to call for prevention and control do not discriminate against patients, let alone people in high-incidence areas.
如果我们把他们当做“敌人”，他们都躲起来了，或者生病了不去医院，这可能会造成更多人的感染。
If we think of them as "enemies," they all go into hiding, or they get sick and don't go to the hospital, which can cause more infections.
应该有一个宽松的环境，让他们站出来，及时接受治疗。
There should be a permissive environment for them to come forward and be treated in a timely manner.
同济医院发热门诊内，“全副武装”的医护人员及戴着口罩的患者　图 |新京报记者向凯我还有一个建议，在后期的防控中，优质的医疗资源要发挥最主要的作用。
At Tongji Hospital's fever clinic, heavily armed medical staff and patients in masks at AT & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; & quot; &
综合性大医院有正规的传染科，有一批呼吸科、传染科人才。
General large hospitals have a formal department of infection, there are a number of respiratory departments, infectious talents.
但一些区级、县级的医疗机构，能力不够，防护的物资可能也不够，让他们来应对传染病，增加了误诊和院内感染的风险。
However, some district and district-level medical institutions may not have sufficient capacity and materials to protect them against infectious diseases, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis and nosocomial infections.
我们要把英雄主义与科学精神结合起来。
We must combine heroism with the spirit of science.
一开始病人多，必须要这么多医疗机构来应对，但将来病人逐渐减少，就应该尽快地关闭没有能力的发热门诊，以免造成新的问题。
At first there were so many patients that it was necessary to deal with them, but as the number of patients dwindled in the future, incapacitated fever clinics should be closed as soon as possible in order to avoid creating new problems.
武汉一线的救治，需要尽快从无序状态转变到有序状态，必须要有序管理、有序运转。
Wuhan first-line treatment, need to change from disorder to order as soon as possible, must be orderly management, orderly operation.
新冠肺炎疫情毕竟是一个长期的消耗战，不是一天两天能够胜利的。
After all, the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic is a long war of attrition, not a one-day victory.
一开始可能是无序混乱的，但这个阶段越短越好。
It may be chaotic at first, but the shorter the stage, the better.
新民周刊：您是湖北人，疫情发生后，是不是特别关注疫情发展？参与了哪些工作？熊利泽：我从一开始就关注这次新冠疫情，早期的信息显示情况还是可以的，尤其武汉医疗资源很丰富，我相信能控制得很好。
Xin Min Weekly: Are you from Hubei province, did you pay special attention to the development of the epidemic? What kind of work did you take part in? Xiong Lize: I was concerned about the new crown outbreak from the very beginning.
疫情扩散以后，按照上级部署，我作为院长组织上海市第四人民医院为应对疫情做了人力、物资、场地的准备。
After the spread of the epidemic, and in accordance with the arrangements made by my superiors, I, as President, organized the Fourth People's Hospital in Shanghai to prepare for the outbreak with manpower, materials and sites.
大年三十，我们提前把急诊二楼全部腾空，作为新冠肺炎疑似肺炎的隔离病房。
In the New Year's Eve, we evacuated the second floor of the emergency room in advance as the isolation ward of suspected pneumonia in Xinguan Pneumonia.
以前发热门诊没有专门的CT，我们紧急采购了一台CT，专门用于发热病人的检查，这样就把交叉感染的可能性降低。
In the past, there was no special CT in the fever clinic, and we purchased an emergency CT to be used to examine febrile patients, thus reducing the possibility of cross-infection.
这台机器是联影提供的，可以自动调节患者体位，我们工作人员也不需要与患者接触。
This machine is provided by syndication, automatically adjusts the position of the patient and our staff does not need to be in contact with the patient.
上海市第四人民医院是上海发热门诊定点医院，我们按照最高的标准来准备，原来整个二楼病房可以收治60多个病人，现在按照传染病标准，可以收治6人。
The Shanghai Fourth People's Hospital is a designated hospital for fever clinics in Shanghai. We have prepared the hospital according to the highest standards. The entire second floor ward can accommodate more than 60 patients.
1月23号，医院就发出了组建援鄂医疗队的号召，医护人员踊跃报名，很快就组建了15人的队伍。
On January 23, the hospital issued a call for medical teams to be set up in Hubei province. Medical staff made great contributions and soon formed a team of 15.
现在15人参加到第二批上海援鄂医疗队，已经进驻武汉第三医院工作。
Now 15 people have joined the second group of medical teams in Shanghai and are already working in Wuhan Third Hospital.
据我所知，第二批医疗队中，上海市第四人民医院是派出医疗人员最多的单个医疗机构。
As far as I know, Shanghai Fourth People's Hospital is the single medical institution with the largest number of medical personnel.
我的专业是麻醉，有很多学生在湖北一线参与救治新冠肺炎病人。
My major is anesthesia, there are a lot of students in Hubei line to help patients with new crown pneumonia.
这些天我一直在把这些年的经验分享给一线的这些医生们。
I've been sharing years of experience with these doctors on the front line.
前几天我写了一篇文章：《抗击新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情：给麻醉科医护工作者的几点建议》，我建议大家在救治新冠肺炎病人，做插管操作的时候，要用药物松弛患者肌肉，减少气管插管时患者喷射分泌物的出现，降低医护人员感染的风险。
The other day, I wrote an article entitled "Fighting the New Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia: Some Suggestions for Anesthesiologists." I suggest that when treating patients with coronavirus infection, we should use drugs to relax the muscles of patients undergoing intubation, reduce the appearance of the patient's jet secretions during intubation, and reduce the risk of infection by medical staff.
征集令《新民周刊》现面向全国征集新冠肺炎采访对象和真实故事：如果你是参与抗击新冠肺炎疫情的医护人员或其家属，我们希望聆听你的“战疫”故事，也希望传达你的诉求。
Call for orders The New People's Weekly is now soliciting interviews and true stories from all over the country: If you are a healthcare worker or family member involved in the fight against the outbreak, we hope to hear your "epidemic" story and convey your message.
