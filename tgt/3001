伊朗议员侯赛因扎德（Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh）4日说，在疫情最先爆发的圣城库姆，已经尸体“成堆”， 而在疫情同样严重的吉兰省首府拉什特，民众也已然“无助”，这无不说明政府“警告不及时”。
Iranian parliamentarian Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh said Thursday that in Qom, the holy city where the outbreak began, bodies were "piled up," while in Rasht, the capital of the same province, where the epidemic was equally severe, people were already "helpless," indicating the government's "untimely warning."

Iran's state television broadcaster, IRIB, was quoted as saying a dozen bodies in black bags were on the ground in a video allegedly shot at the Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue in Qom.
太平间负责人称，目前还不确定这些尸体是否感染了新冠病毒，之所以没有下葬，是因为病毒检测需要一定的时间。
The morgue's director said it was not clear whether the bodies were infected with the new crown virus and that the reason why they were not buried was because it took time to detect the virus.
上述视频截图 来源：CNN《华盛顿邮报》5日也援引由伊朗活动人士加里布（Nariman Gharib）提供的医院数据称，在截至4日的六天内，德黑兰的十几家医院已经报告了80例新冠肺炎死亡病例，而这些医院只是德黑兰医疗机构中的一小部分。
According to hospital data provided by Iranian activist Nariman Gharib, 80 new cases of pneumonia-related deaths have been reported in a dozen hospitals in Tehran over the past six days, only a fraction of those in Tehran, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Other nurses from Tehran and Mashhad told the paper that the number of cases not included in official figures was increasing.
伊朗议员侯赛因扎德认为，政府已是时候采取更严厉的措施。
Iranian parliamentarian Hossein Zadeh says the time has come for the government to take more drastic measures.
伊朗总统鲁哈尼曾在上周三（2月26日）表示，尽管新冠疫情在各地暴发，但政府没有计划对任何城镇实施卫生隔离，只会“隔离个人”。
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last Wednesday (February 26) that despite outbreaks in various parts of the country, the government had no plans to impose a health quarantine on any town, only to "isolate individuals."
侯赛因扎德4日在社交媒体上写道，“你们（指伊朗政府）之前没有隔离城市，但既然现在疫情已达顶峰，至少也应该在库姆和拉什特强制实施居家隔离，别让伊朗成为全球新冠肺炎死亡病例最多的国家。
"You [the Iranian government] did not isolate the cities before, but now that the epidemic has peaked, at least household isolation should be enforced in Qom and Rasht to keep Iran from becoming the world's leading cause of death from pneumonia," Hussein-Zadeh wrote on social media Thursday.
