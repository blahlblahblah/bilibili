原标题：【特写】疫情中的三和大神：睡大街没收入，政府安排救助却依然选择流浪图片来源：界面新闻记者 | 陆柯言 徐诗琪编辑 | 文姝琪位于深圳市龙华区东环一路的三和人才市场，周围密集地分布着廉价的饭馆、网吧、旅馆和杂货店。
2007-3-1 15: 48 The Three and Great Deity of the Epidemic: Sleeping street without income, the government arranged relief but still chose to stray from: Interface News Correspondent & # 45; Xu Shichi, an editor and employee of WenNingqi, located in the Third and Talent Markets along the Donghuan Road of Longhua District, Shenzhen.
众多年轻人常年在这里游荡，他们大多不愿意找稳定的工作，做着日结百元的零工打发时间。
Many young people roam here all year round. Most of them are unwilling to find stable jobs and work part-time for a hundred yuan a day.
赚了钱就去住旅馆，没钱的时候就露宿街头。
He made money and went to a hotel and lived on the street when he had no money.
2018年，日本NHK电视台的一部纪录片将这些年轻人“捧红”，他们被称作“三和大神”。
In 2018, a NHK television documentary made these young people "hot," known as the "Three Ones and the Great God."
突如其来的疫情打断了三和大神们的“逍遥”生活。
The sudden epidemic has disrupted the lives of the three great gods.
疫情期间，为了防止人员流动加剧疫情传播，三和一带的住宅区和部分主要干道被封禁，大神们曾经睡觉的楼顶、银行和公园都不能再进入，只能睡在大街上。
During the outbreak, in order to prevent the movement of people from spreading, residential areas and some of the main roads in the Three and Three Areas were closed and the roofs of buildings, banks and parks where the gods had slept could no longer be entered and had to sleep on the streets.
三和人才市场附近被封路的小区。
Third, and talent market near the blockaded neighborhoods.

1湖北人李三已经十几年没回过家了。
Li San from Hubei Province has not been home for more than ten years.
按照计划，他应该会在附近找一家每晚50元的旅馆过春节，等过了初七，就去找工作。
According to the plan, he will find a nearby hotel of 50 yuan every night Spring Festival, after the seventh day of junior high school, to look for a job.
但随着疫情的加重，他被老板“请“出了旅馆，已经在大街上睡了一个多月。
But as the epidemic worsened, he was "invited" out of the hotel by his boss and had been sleeping on the street for more than a month.
睡大街对李三来说倒不是什么难事。
Sleeping on the street is not too difficult for Li San.
他在三和一带混了十几年，只要身上没钱了，他就会去睡大街。
After spending more than a decade in Third World, he would go to sleep in the street if he had no money.
哪几家店门口可以睡，不会被赶，他几乎如数家珍。
He could sleep in front of a few shops and would not be turned away. He was almost a treasure.
但随着当地疫情防控工作的推行，三和人力资源集团大楼被封锁，广场、公园这些三和大神们曾经的“老家”也都围上了栏杆。
However, with the implementation of local epidemic prevention and control efforts, the Third and Human Resource Group buildings were blocked, squares, parks, these three and the gods were once the "home" are also surrounded by railing.
不得已之下，他只能去寻找新的住处。
As a last resort, he had to find a new place to live.
李三的“新家”在金龙华广场附近的一个天桥下，这里聚集了几十位跟他差不多境遇的人，大家都没有住处。
Li's "new home" is under a flyover near Jinlong Hua Square, where dozens of people like him gather without a place to live.
除了一部分湖北人因为户籍被旅馆拒绝留宿外，更多人睡在这里是因为，自己早就没钱了。
In addition to some Hubei people because of the hotel refused to stay in the hotel, more people sleep here because they have no money.
围满了流浪人员的天桥。
A flyover full of vagrants.
图片来源：界面新闻没钱也就没有吃穿，饥一顿饱一顿是他们的常态。
Photo source: Interface news without money also did not eat and clothe, hunger full meal is their normal.
而疫情又为这群人增加了一件难事：缺口罩。
And the epidemic adds another difficulty to the group: the gap.
梁斌是李三的朋友。
Liang Bin is a friend of Li San.
他意识到要戴口罩的时候，全国各地都已经一“罩”难求，即使有钱都买不到，于是他索性不戴。
He realized that when he needed a mask, it was hard to get it all over the country, even if he had money, so he wouldn't wear it at all.
直到街边开始出现免费派口罩的政府工作人员和义工，梁斌和他的同伴们才戴上了一次性医用口罩。
Only when government workers and volunteers began donating free masks along the street did Mr. Liang and his companions put on disposable medical masks.
但由于口罩供应稀缺，并不能每天按需发放，梁斌脸上的口罩已经戴了10天。
But because the supply of masks is scarce and cannot be distributed on a daily basis, Mr. Liang has worn a mask for 10 days.
不过，对他们来说，一个口罩戴两个礼拜也不是稀奇事。
For them, though, it's not unusual for a mask to last two weeks.
在梁斌周围，有人口罩脏得发黑，有的已经起毛，有人的挂绳已经扯断，靠透明胶黏在脸上。
Around Liang Bin, some of the mask dirty black, some have hair, others have broken the hanging rope, transparent glue stuck to the face.
“反正我们没几个人口罩是合格的，戴和不戴都一样。
"We don't have enough masks in the world anyway, just like we don't.
”梁斌边说边解开口罩，“几天不吃饭都扛下来了，还怕什么病毒？”2梁斌见到界面新闻记者这天，说自己已经两天没吃饭了。
"Liang Bin said while unmask," a few days do not eat down, but also afraid of what virus? "2 Liang Bin saw the interface reporter that day, said he had not eaten in two days.
疫情期间，这些流浪者的食物大部分都靠政府和社会爱心人士发放。
During the epidemic, most of the food was distributed by the government and the caring community.
但免费食物不是天天都有，得看谁消息更灵通，撞上了是运气好，撞不上只能饿着。
But free food is not every day, to see who better informed, hit is lucky, can not hit only hungry.
每天一到饭点，也会有小贩到天桥这边卖10块钱一份的盒饭，偶尔会有些荤腥。
Every day at meal time, there will be hawkers to the flyover to sell 10 yuan a piece of boxed rice, occasionally a bit fishy.
以前可以打零工的时候，梁斌还是吃得起的，但他已经很久没工作了。
Before can do odd jobs, Liang Bin still can afford, but he has not been working for a long time.
由于梁斌的户口所在地湖南湘潭离湖北较近，他同样被许多招工需求排除在外。
As Liang Bin's hukou, Hunan Xiangtan is near Hubei, he is also excluded from many recruitment needs.
在没钱吃饭的境地下，三和大神都盼望着能快点找到一份工作。
With no money to eat, Sanhe and Big God were looking forward to finding a job soon.
但即使如此，他们对工作也有着自己的挑选标准。
But even so, they have their own selection criteria for their jobs.
三和人才市场附近的宣传标语。
III. Propaganda near the job market.
图片来源：界面新闻梁斌最近接触到的一个工作是在高速公路上测体温，这个工作被他拒绝了。
Photo Source: Interface News Liang Bin recently came in contact with a highway temperature test, which he refused.
“一天工作18个小时，工资才一百多块，人家厂里一个小时就27块了。
"" I work 18 hours a day for more than a hundred bucks a day, and the factory sells for 27 bucks an hour.
”梁斌说。
"said Liang.
那为什么不去工厂呢？梁斌说他被黑工厂骗过，一天只能睡四个小时，而且“工厂里面太累了，吃不饱，没力气”。
Why not go to the factory? Mr. Liang said he had been tricked by the black factory into sleeping only four hours a day, and that "the factory was tired, hungry and weak."
也有人建议过梁斌去做分拣快递的工作，但他不想一直站着。
He was also advised to work as a sorter, but he did not want to stay standing.
招工中介张铭对此很无奈。
Recruitment agency Zhang Ming is very helpless.
张铭几个月前也是三和大神之一。
Zhang Ming was also one of the three gods a few months ago.
他在电子厂打工，干一个月玩一个月，形容自己“是个废人”。
He worked in an electronics factory for a month, describing himself as "a wreck."
一位路过的女生改变了他。
A girl passing by changed him.
对方给露宿街头的张铭送了一床被子，他特地加了对方微信表示感谢。
The other party to the street Zhang Ming sent a quilt, he specially added a message of thanks.
此后，对方时常鼓励他，不要对生活失去信心。
After that, he was often encouraged not to lose faith in life.
“她是这个世界上最伟大的人。
"She is the greatest person in the world.
”张铭说，是那位女生让他燃起了对生活的希望。
Zhang Ming said it was the girl who gave him hope in life.
今年年初，他去找了一份稳定的中介工作，一方面一个月能挣好几千；另一方面，他也想帮助曾经一起流浪的人们脱离困苦，好好工作，过上体面的生活。
Earlier this year, he found a steady job as a middleman, earning several thousand a month. On the other hand, he wanted to help people who had been wandering together get out of poverty, work hard and live a decent life.
不过，张铭的中介工作并不顺利。
But Mr Zhang's intermediation has not been easy.
他告诉界面新闻，他手里有很多不限户籍的工作，大多在工厂。
He told Interface News that he had a lot of open-ended jobs, mostly in factories.
可是，张明几乎问遍了三和一带所有的露宿者，98%的人都拒绝了他提供的工作，说自己只做日结。
However, Zhang Ming asked almost all the street sleepers in the three and the surrounding area, and 98% of them turned down the offer, saying that they only had to make ends meet.
他本以为疫情的来临会让大神们更渴望一份包吃住、有口罩的稳定岗位，可他发现自己错了。
He thought the arrival of the outbreak would make the gods crave a stable job with food, shelter and masks, but he found himself wrong.
但无论如何，张铭还是想帮一帮他们。
But anyway, Zhang wants to help them.
他的手里偶尔会有从工厂里拿过来的口罩，也会带给三和的老朋友们。
Occasionally, he would have a mask from the factory in his hand, which he would bring to Sanhe's old friends.
有人说他是好人，他觉得自己算不上，“只是做了鸡毛蒜皮的小事。
Someone said he was a good man, and he didn't think he was, "It's just a trifle.
”3三和大神们盼望的日结工作并不是每天都有，因此大多时候，他们都在街上闲逛。
The day-to-day work desired by the Three Gods and the Great Gods was not daily, so most of the time they wandered about the streets.
考虑到他们的安全问题，疫情开始后不久，龙华街道办民政组就开始组织设立社会闲散人员的临时安置点，为这些流浪者们提供可以免费吃住的地方。
Considering their safety problems, the Civil Affairs Section of Longhua Street began to organize the establishment of temporary social idlers to provide them with free accommodation and food soon after the outbreak began.
龙华区目前有两个临时安置点，分别设立在新华中学和伟民小学，到目前为止累计收治过800人，最高峰同时收治了400人。
At present, there are two temporary resettlement places in Longhua Middle School and Weimin Primary School. So far, 800 people have been admitted to Longhua Middle School and 400 people have been treated at the same time.
据民政组的工作人员于小丽介绍，安置点内提供基础食宿，包括水、泡面、八宝粥、凉席和被褥。
According to civil affairs team staff Yu Xiaoli, the settlement provides basic accommodation, including water, noodles, Baobao porridge, sandals and bedding.
安置点采取自愿进入的原则，龙华各个社区的街道办工作人员如果有发现流落大街的人员，会将其接进来暂避疫情，并不会设户籍限制。
The principle of voluntary entry is applied in the settlements, and street workers from all communities in Longhua who find people living on the streets will bring them in to avoid the outbreak and will not impose any household registration restrictions.
于小丽告诉界面新闻，安置点会对收治进来的闲散人员进行核酸检测。
Yu Xiaoli told the interface news that the resettlement places will be admitted to the idle personnel for nucleic acid testing.
目前核酸检测已经做完，为了避免疫情散播的风险，安置点暂时不能再加入新成员。
At present, nucleic acid testing has been completed, in order to avoid the risk of the spread of the epidemic, resettlement sites can no longer join the new members.
由于社会闲散人员没有固定收入，安置点还会为他们联系工作。
Since there is no fixed income for social idlers, the settlements also work for them.
但让于小丽无奈的是，介绍去工作的那批人，有一部分在干了两三天之后就拿钱离开了，重新回到大街上流浪。
But to her dismay, some of the people who had been introduced to work, after two or three days, left with the money and returned to the streets.
对于这样的结果，于小丽也束手无策。
Yu Xiaoli is helpless for such an outcome.
她说，安置点人员需要24小时值守，不仅要满足收治人员的一日三餐，还要处理他们的日常纠纷、帮他们联系工作，负荷已经很重。
She said people in the settlement needed to be on duty 24 hours a day, not only to meet three meals a day, but also to deal with their daily disputes and help them with their work, which was already very heavy.
现在，于小丽也不知道安置点会开设到什么时候。
Now, Yu Xiaoli does not know when the settlement will be opened.
界面新闻联系上一位曾进入安置点，又从工厂中逃出来的人，大家都叫他粉哥。
The Interface News contacted a man who had entered the settlement and escaped from the factory. He was known as Fango.
他表示，安置点内的伙食“太素”，介绍的工厂工作也不适合他，他更想出来待着。
He said the food in the settlement was "too vegetarian" and the factory job introduced was not for him, and he wanted to stay.
“有比我还要惨的流浪汉，我觉得他们更应该进去。
"There are vagrants who are worse off than I am, and I think they ought to go in.
”粉哥有一辆摩拜单车，锁是用石头砸碎的。
"Fango had a motor-bike and the lock was smashed with stones.
一个黑色塑料袋经常挂在车上，他身边的人说，那是粉哥用来喝水的袋子，喝完了再找个水龙头接。
A black plastic bag was often hung in the car. People close to him said that it was the sack that he used to drink water.
他和很多三和大神一样，有钱了就去旅馆开房，可以洗澡上网，没钱就去公厕。
Like many of the Three Gods, he had money to open a room in a hotel, bathe on the Internet, and go to the public toilet without money.
这一天，他刚刚去公厕洗了个头。
That day, he had just gone to the public toilet for a shower.
以前，粉哥的生活不是这样的。
In the past, this was not the case in Fango's life.
去年他还在惠州做销售，能够维持正常生活。
Last year he was selling in Huizhou and was able to maintain a normal life.
但他好赌，网络赌博让他把存款输了个精光。
But he gambles. Internet gambling makes him lose all his savings.
由于和家人早已断联，走投无路之下，他借钱来到深圳，加入了在三和打零工的队伍。
With his family cut off, he borrowed money to go to Shenzhen to join the ranks of the third and odd workers.
粉哥不愿意去工厂。
Fango doesn't want to go to the factory.
现在的他在大街上睡纸壳，前些日子天气比较冷，他就和几个同伴一起抱着睡觉。
Now he sleeps on the street in a cardboard shell. It was cold the other day and he slept with a few of his friends.
“我现在就游手好闲，至少我自由。
"I am idle now, or at least I am free.
”粉哥说。
"said Pink.
疫情还在持续，粉哥们常去的网吧和图书馆都关门了，许多人因为没钱变卖了手机，基本上没有什么娱乐活动。
The epidemic continues, with Internet cafes and libraries often closed, and many people have little recreational activity because they cannot afford to sell their mobile phones.
粉哥周围，有几个人在讨论用网贷的钱去一趟澳门，“再赌一把”。
Around Fango, a few people are talking about using the money to go to Macau, "another gamble."
到了真混不下去的时候，这群人的最终归宿是被救助站送回老家。
When it was too late, the final destination of the group was to be sent home by the rescue station.
但大多数人都不想回去，有的人觉得自己混不好没脸回去，而有的人觉得自己早就没有了家人。
But most people do not want to go back, some people feel that they do not have the face to go back, while others feel that they have no family.
继续留在三和做干一天玩一天的大神，被更多人认为是“最好”的出路。
Remain on three and do a day of play God, more people think that the "best" way out.
被拦杆围住的三和人才市场。
Third and talent markets surrounded by bars.
图片来源：界面新闻三和大神是外界给他们的代号，但他们从不这样称呼自己。
Source: Interface News 3 and Big God are the code name given to them by the outside world, but they never call themselves that.
“我们都不是真正的三和大神，真正的大神一眼就能看出来”，天桥下的一个人说：“他们脸上没有表情，从来不和人说话，总是独来独往，没人知道他们过得好不好。
"We are not the true Three and the Great Deity," said a man under the flyover. "They have no expression on their faces, they never talk to anyone, they are always alone and no one knows how they are doing.
