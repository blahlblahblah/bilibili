Author: Guo Ruyi Source: US billionaire Mickey Alison, 71, a business figure, has been in serious trouble recently.
过去一个月，他所执掌公司旗下的三艘豪华邮轮，先后在海上遭遇新冠肺炎疫情。
In the past month, he has presided over three of the company's luxury cruise ships, the first in the new crown pneumonia at sea.
数千名笼罩在不安阴影下的乘客和船员，令邮轮所有者嘉年华集团迎来一场严重的经营危机。
Thousands of passengers and crew have been shrouded in insecurity, ushering in a serious business crisis for Carnival, the cruise ship's owner.
嘉年华集团是全球邮轮业巨头。
Carnival Group is a global cruise giant.
2月初，其旗下邮轮“钻石公主号”在进行一次东南亚航线航行时，船上首先发生感染事件，最终确诊人数将近七百人。
In early February, its cruise ship, Princess Diamond, first contracted an infection on a South-East Asian cruise and was eventually diagnosed with nearly 700 people.
几乎同一时间，所属一艘荷美邮轮在停靠柬埔寨港口后，一名85岁美国女子被确诊。
At about the same time, an 85-year-old American woman was diagnosed after a Dutch cruise ship docked at a Cambodian port.
最新的一次爆发，则出现在另一艘公主号邮轮“至尊公主号”上，目前船上已有21人确诊感染。
The latest outbreak occurred on board the other vessel, Princess Sutras, which now has 21 people on board.
米奇·阿里森是嘉年华的最大个人股东。
Mickey Allison is the biggest individual shareholder in Fiesta.
受疫情事件冲击，嘉年华邮轮股票近期持续走跌。
Carnival cruise stocks have recently continued to fall as a result of the epidemic.
叠加美股本周一的恐慌性大抛售，嘉年华从1月17日51.94美元的阶段性高点，跌至最新收盘的21.74美元，高达178亿美元市值在两个月内蒸发殆尽。
The superimposed U.S. stocks panicked Monday as Carnival dipped to its latest close of $21.74 from its January 17 milestone of $51.94, and its market capitalisation of $17.8 billion evaporated in two months.
阿里森是美国富豪榜上的常客，在2019年福布斯美国400富豪榜单上，他以81亿美元身家位列第59位。
A regular on the U.S. rich list, Allison ranks 59th with $8.1 billion on Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans in 2019.
除此之外，这位邮轮大亨还因是NBA热火队的幕后老板，在球队所在的佛罗里达州迈阿密市可谓大名鼎鼎。
In addition, the cruise tycoon, who owns the NBA Heat behind the scenes, is famous in Miami, Florida, where his team is based.
与那些从辍学到走上人生巅峰的超级富豪一样，阿里森也有相似的经历。
Like the super-rich who have dropped out of school to reach the pinnacle of their lives, Allison has had a similar experience.
1972年，他的父亲特德·阿里森在几次创业失败之后成立了嘉年华，当时看中邮轮生意的特德，用1美元和承担所有债务的形式买下一艘改装过的旧远洋客轮，开始了嘉年华的首航。
His father, Ted Alison, founded the Fiesta in 1972, after several failed ventures, when Ted, who was in the cruise business, bought an old converted ocean liner in the form of a dollar and took on all the debt to begin the carnival's first voyage.
从迈阿密大学退学的阿里森，先后在公司销售部门、预订部门和客运部门任职历练，并在1979年接替其父出任嘉年华邮轮CEO。
Mr. Alison, who dropped out of the University of Miami, worked successively in the company's sales, reservation and passenger-transport divisions, and succeeded his father as Carnival CEO in 1979.
那一年，阿里森年仅30岁。
Alison was only 30 that year.
上世纪七十年代，是现代邮轮行业的起步时期。
In the 1970s, it was the beginning of modern cruise industry.
早先乘坐嘉年华邮轮的，多是放假的年轻乘客。
Early carnival cruise, the majority of young passengers are on holiday.
经历了创业初期的艰难，这家新创公司在第三年实现盈利。
After a difficult start-up, the start-up made a profit in its third year.
而在阿里森接棒CEO八年之后，嘉年华于1987年成功上市。
Carnival went public in 1987, eight years after Allison took over as CEO.
他在同一年进入公司董事会，随后在1990年出任董事长。
He joined the company's board of directors in the same year and subsequently became chairman in 1990.
嘉年华由此正式进入阿里森时代。
Carnival thus officially entered the age of Allison.
展露锋芒的嘉年华迎来一段迅速扩张的时期。
A period of rapid expansion ushered in by the spectacular carnival.
在1988年兼并竞争对手皇家加勒比公司的企图失败之后，此后的十余年间，阿里森策划连续收购了荷美邮轮、世邦邮轮、英国最大邮轮公司冠达邮轮以及歌诗达邮轮等一系列高端或奢华品牌，嘉年华逐渐成长为举足轻重的全球邮轮巨头。
For more than a decade after his failed attempt to merge rival Royal Caribbean in 1988, Mr. Allison engineered the acquisition of a range of high-end or luxury brands, including Homemade Cruises, World Cruises, Crown Cruises, and Goethea Cruises, which grew into a major global cruise giant.
而圈地过程中最为戏剧性的一幕，正是发生在“公主邮轮”这一品牌上。
The most dramatic scene in the encirclement took place on the brand of "Princess Cruise."
2003，嘉年华完成对英国公主邮轮价值55亿美元的收购，后者当时是世界第三大邮轮公司。
In 2003, Carnival completed a $5.5 billion acquisition of the British Princess Cruise, then the world's third-largest cruise company.
合并后的嘉年华成为全球最大邮轮公司，约占43%的市场份额。
The merged carnival became the world's largest cruise company, with a market share of about 43 per cent.
而嘉年华之所以能拿下这笔签约，要归功于阿里森敏锐的商业头脑和“犀利”的谈判策略。
But Carnival was able to win the contract, thanks to Allison's keen business acumen and "acuteness" of the negotiation strategy.
其实在卖给嘉年华之前，公主邮轮已经与皇家加勒比签署合并协议，但无法容忍对手坐大的阿里森花费几个月时间，不停游说公主邮轮的股东，使得这笔交易最终告吹。
The princess had already signed a merger agreement with the Royal Caribbean before it was sold to Carnival, but could not tolerate months of lobbying Princess Cruise shareholders by the big rival, which eventually blew up the deal.
相反，嘉年华凭借更为优厚的报价，顺利将公主邮轮收入了囊中。
In contrast, Fiesta relied on the more generous offer, the princess cruise smoothly into the bag.
随着这桩被英国媒体称为“炮舰外交”的交易完成，嘉年华迎来巅峰性时刻。
With the deal, dubbed "gunboat diplomacy" by the British press, the Fiesta reached its zenith.
功成名就的阿里森在2013年6月辞去CEO职务，他担任此职长达34年时间。
The successful Mr Allison resigned as CEO in June 2013 after 34 years in office.
当时他告诉投资者，他哪也不会去，在可预见的未来将继续留任董事长。
He told investors he would not go anywhere and would remain chairman for the foreseeable future.
阿里森作别一线，放权给了继任者。
Alison took a different tack and devolved power to his successor.
阿里森家族看上的不只是邮轮生意。
The Allison family is not only interested in the cruise business.
早在特德时期，他本人就是热火队的创始人之一，并将NBA带入了南佛罗里达州。
As early as Ted, he was one of the founders of the Heat and brought the NBA to South Florida.
上世纪九十年代前期，阿里森从父亲手中继承下球队的大部分股权，随后又收购了其余合伙人手中的股份，成为迈阿密热队的实际掌舵者。
In the early 1990s, Allison inherited a large chunk of the team from his father and later acquired shares in the other partners, becoming the de facto steersman of Miami Heat.
热火队在阿里森手中迅速崛起，2006年热火首次拿下NBA总冠军。
The Heat rose to prominence in Allison's hands and won the NBA championship for the first time in 2006.
2010年，在阿里森的运作下，詹姆斯、韦德和波什这三位NBA巨头齐聚球队，热火也在2012年和2013年连续两次登顶。
In 2010, three NBA giants -- James, Wade and Bosch -- came together under Allison's watch, and Heat peaked twice in 2012 and 2013.
邮轮行业是一个富人玩的游戏，正是在商业世界的巨大成功，阿里森成为NBA最富有的老板之一。
The cruise industry is a game for the rich, and it is in the commercial world that Allison has become one of the NBA's richest bosses.
不过在此次疫情危机之前，嘉年华的发展也并非一帆风顺。
However, before the outbreak of the crisis, Carnival development is not plain sailing.
过去几年，全行业的周期性波动，以及旗下邮轮发生多起重大事故，一度令嘉年华的商业帝国备受考验。
The carnival's commercial empire has been tested over the past few years by cyclical fluctuations across the industry and a number of major accidents at its cruise lines.
事后证明，阿里森和嘉年华均经受住了这些考验。
As it turned out, Allison and Fiesta withstood these tests.
公开资料显示，目前嘉年华集团已是“全球最大的休闲旅游公司”，在北美、欧洲、澳洲和亚洲拥有10个邮轮品牌，这些品牌一共经营超过100艘邮轮。
According to public sources, Carnival is now the world's largest leisure tourism company, with 10 cruise brands in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia, which together handle more than 100 cruise ships.
凭借票务收入、船上收入（如酒水饮料、赌场、岸上短途游的抽成等）和旅游收入等，嘉年华在2019财年实现利润达30亿美元。
With ticketing revenue, shipboard revenues (such as drinks, casinos, onshore excursions, etc.) and tourism receipts, Carnival made a profit of $3 billion in the 2019 fiscal year.
与此同时，这个行业巨无霸仍在继续扩张。
Meanwhile, the industry's colossus continues to expand.
今年1月份，嘉年华交付给中国合资公司的首艘邮轮停靠上海吴淞口国际邮轮码头。
In January, the first cruise ship delivered to a Chinese joint venture by Carnival docked at Wusongkou International Cruise Terminal in Shanghai.
这家合资公司由嘉年华与中国船舶旗下企业成立，按照预计，到2028年中船嘉年华将拥有8艘大型邮轮，一跃成为中国最大的邮轮公司。
The joint venture, formed by Carnival and the China Shipping Agency, is expected to have eight large cruise ships by mid-2028, making it China's largest cruise company.
而今年全年，嘉年华自身也将接收4艘新建邮轮，进一步扩大船队规模。
Throughout the year, Carnival itself will receive four new cruise ships, further expanding its fleet.
但是，阿里森的宏图计划或许要被这场疫情干扰了。
But Mr Alison's ambitious plans may be derailed by the epidemic.
嘉年华近日表示，受疫情影响，嘉年华在中国港口的邮轮业务不得不停止，在亚洲其他地区的航行也已经取消。
Carnival said recently that due to the outbreak, Carnival's cruise business in Chinese ports had to stop and navigation in other parts of Asia had been cancelled.
此外，疫情对全球预订量的影响和航次的取消，将进一步打击财务业绩。
In addition, the impact of the epidemic on global bookings and the cancellation of flights will further undermine financial performance.
由于目前疫情在美国和欧洲的持续发酵、肆虐，很大程度上依赖这些地区市场的嘉年华，遭受的损失恐一时难以估量。
As the current epidemic in the United States and Europe continue to ferment, largely dependent on the market carnival in these areas, the loss may be difficult to measure for a while.
在成长为超级富豪和城市精英的过程中，阿里森曾获得过很多荣誉，从不少外国首脑手中接收过奖励勋章。
In his quest to become a super-rich and urban elite, Allison has won many honours and many awards from foreign leaders.
但这次他面前不再是熟悉的鲜花和掌声，他需要再次施展“魔力”，带领嘉年华这艘巨轮早日闯过险滩，重新驶入大洋。
But this time he was no longer familiar with the flowers and applause, he needed to once again "magic" to lead the Carnival this big ship early break through the dangerous beaches, re-into the ocean.
