春分，我贪婪地用窗外的声音感知春天。
At the vernal equinox, I feel spring greedily with the sound of my window.
你还好吗☞。
Are you okay, buddy?
优良better                      。
Excellent better.
优良better。
Excellent better.
better your life，专注于更好的自我，以及随之而来的更好的世界。
Better your life, focusing on your better self, and the better world that comes with it.
。
.
转眼已是春分，我们还没来得及去感知，2020年的春天就快要走到尽头。
It was the vernal equinox, and before we could perceive it, the spring of 2020 would come to an end.
今年的春天注定会被我们记得。
This spring is destined to be remembered.
它会在以后的春天里，某个我们突然放松下来的时候，再次于脑海中闪回。
It will come back to mind the next spring, when we suddenly relax.
这一年春天我们没有走出家门，而是在封闭近两个月后，在网上和几百万人一起看了一场樱花直播。
Instead of leaving our homes this spring, we watched a live broadcast of the cherry blossoms online with millions of people after nearly two months of isolation.
这一年春天我们认识了很多人，被消失的吹哨人，冲在前线的医护工作者，激情汉骂的武汉嫂子们还有数不清的志愿者。
We met a lot of people this spring, lost whistlers, medical workers on the front lines, passionate sisters-in-law in Wuhan and countless volunteers.
这一年的春天是白色的，是一纸纸通告，一件件防护服和一些来不及说再见的苍白离别。
The spring of the year was white, a notice of paper, protective clothing, and pale parting without time to say good-bye.
这一年春天被很多味道覆盖，青草的味道，口罩的无纺布味道，消毒水的味道，酒精挥发的味道。
This spring was covered with a lot of flavour, the smell of grass, the smell of a non-woven mask, the smell of disinfectant, the smell of alcohol volatilization.
这一年春天我们听到很多声音，寻常的或者特别的，有意义的或者无意义的。
This spring we heard a lot of sounds, ordinary or special, meaningful or meaningless.
它们组成了2020年武汉的春天。
They make up Wuhan spring of 2020.
【鸟叫】@二十四口朦朦胧胧中，被社区消毒拖车经过的刺耳声吵醒后，一般还需要睡一个回笼觉才能彻底清醒。
"Bird song" @ 24 hazy, by the community disinfection trailer after the harsh sound of awakening, generally need to sleep a cage to fully awake.
会不自觉问自己“今天多少号，今天星期几”，思考片刻后又觉得无意义。
Will not consciously ask themselves "today's number, today's day", thought for a moment and then feel meaningless.
去到洗手间，楼上邻居家的声音顺着下水道传进窗户，隔着好几堵墙，也能清晰听到奶奶和和孙女在说笑，话题跟甜玉米和糯玉米有关。
To the restroom, the voices of the neighbors upstairs came down the drain into the window, and through the walls Grandma and her granddaughter could be heard talking and laughing, talking about sweet corn and glutinous corn.
忍不住停下手头的动作，把耳朵更贴近窗户，变态般的动作只为听到更多的对话，谁叫这声音让我感到安心。
I could not help stopping my movements, putting my ears closer to the window and acting strangely to hear more conversation.
可惜对话却停止了，只剩另一方向传来的清脆鸟鸣。
Unfortunately, the dialogue has stopped, leaving only the sound of a crisp bird in the other direction.
平时赏心悦耳的鸟叫声，此时此刻却全比不上平时被视为噪音的喧嚷，因为只有人的声音才能让一切显得正常。
The sound of birds, which are usually pleasant to hear, is now nothing like the noise normally thought of as noise, for only the voice of man can make things seem normal.
空无一人的小区花园阳台上，明媚的阳光斜射在脏衣篓，静好的画面让我忘记身上的睡衣已经穿了快30天。
On the empty garden balcony, the sun shines brightly in the filthy basket. The still picture makes me forget that my pajamas have been worn for nearly 30 days.
武汉的春本就短暂，今年的春装更是出彩无望。
Wuhan spring on the short, this year's spring is even more hopeless.
静静地，楼下的粉色小花开了，风也褪去了冰凉，我多么希望这只是一个普通的星期六早上。
Quietly, the pink flowers below opened and the wind cooled. I wish it was just an ordinary Saturday morning.
【 狗吠声 】@慕遥这个春天，我常常是在中午才在楼下一家人大嗓门的喊叫式对话中醒来。
Dogbark @ Mooyao This spring, I often wake up at noon in a loud, shouting conversation with a family downstairs.
这在平时看来近乎噪音的声音，竟然成为疫情中难得能接触到的“人气儿”。
This in peacetime looks like the noise sound, unexpectedly becomes the epidemic in the rare can contact "the human spirit".
楼下那家有一块很大的空中平台，养着花，种着菜，还养着猫和狗。
The house downstairs had a large aerial platform with flowers, vegetables and cats and dogs.
搬过来这么久，我才知道平日里震天的狗吠声竟然全来自三只小小的、黑色的、我不知道品种的狗。
It took me so long to move in that I knew that the daily barking of a dog came from three tiny, black dogs of a species I did not know.
这些日子，只要没事我就会坐在阳台上，看他们家的狗狗或打闹喊叫，或不停跑动，或安静地趴在那里。
These days, whenever I'm okay, I sit on the balcony and watch their dog yell, run, or lie quietly on the ground.
我甚至从中体会到一种偷偷窃取别人快乐的刺激，获得诡异的满足感。
I even get a weird satisfaction from the thrill of stealing someone else's happiness.
有时候也会对它们产生奇怪的羡慕之情——这个春天，它们尚有一块空旷地方可以撒欢，可以自由地感受春风拂面，不必隔着窗户窥看新开的花，也不用担忧着那不知何时才能彻底过去的疫情。
Strange envy of them sometimes - this spring, they have an open space where they can enjoy themselves, feel the spring breeze blowing on their faces, do not have to look through the windows to see the new flowers, and do not worry about when the epidemic will be completely over.
属于我们的春天呢，何时才会到来？【割草声】@鸭纸安静的午后，屋外传来阵阵嗡嗡的响声，探头望去，发现原来是环卫工正在割草。
Where is the spring that belongs to usWhen will the time come [mowing the grass] On a quiet afternoon outside the house came a buzzing sound, and looking out, I saw that it was the sanitation workers who were mowing the grass.
她穿着厚厚的防护服，全副武装地行走在一片绽放的迎春花中。
She was wearing thick protective clothing and walking heavily armed in a blooming jasmine.
雨后特有的泥土清香也在这时钻进我的鼻子里，真是令人怀念的味道。
The peculiar smell of earth after the rain also crept into my nose at this time, is really a nostalgic taste.
封城已有快两个月，脑海中关于外面世界的印象开始有些模糊起来。
Nearly two months into the city, the mental picture of the outside world began to blur.
草长高了，风变暖了，樱花也开了，春天已经来了，距离疫情结束的日子进入倒计时了。
The grass grows tall, the wind warms, the cherry blossoms open, spring has arrived, and the countdown to the end of the epidemic is approaching.
想必不久后，就可以痛痛快快地在草地里打滚了吧。
It must not be long before you are able to roll merrily about in the grass.
3月18日窗外的武汉夕阳【“武汉加油”】@Ailsa1月27日20：00，不少武汉市民在小区自发开窗集体隔空高歌《义勇军进行曲》《我和我的祖国》，小区广播也随之“伴奏”。
March 18, the window of Wuhan sunset [Wuhan refueling ") @ Ailsa January 27 20: 00, a number of Wuhan city residents in the community spontaneously opened the windows of the collective isolation of the song" March of the Volunteer Corps "" Me and my motherland, "the community radio" accompaniment.
从此起彼伏到越来越整齐洪亮，大家仿佛要在呐喊和歌声中将突如其来的疫情给造成的恐慌、迷茫、压抑、痛苦，全部表达和释放。
From one moment to the next, each seemed to express and release the panic, confusion, depression and pain caused by the sudden outbreak in a shout and song.
“武汉加油”这四个字不仅仅是对武汉的祝福和祈祷，也是我们给予自己的鼓励。
"Wuhan refueling" these four words are not only to Wuhan blessing and prayer, but also we give their own encouragement.
期待武汉痊愈的那一天，期待繁花盛开的春天。
Looking forward to Wuhan recovery of that day, looking forward to the blooming spring flowers.
【朋友的歌声】@符煕朝今年的春天，我一个人在武汉。
The Song of a Friend To this spring, I was alone in Wuhan.
屋子里总是安静的，哪怕是打游戏也只有敲键盘的声音。
The room was always quiet, and even playing games was like tapping on a keyboard.
隔绝和寂静给了人放松的借口，至少在游戏中，我不是一个人。
Insulation and silence give people an excuse to relax, at least in the game, I am not alone.
那次，无意中看到高中时最好的朋友也在线，虽然很久没有跟她说过话，不知道关系还是不是像从前，但还是鼓起勇气问她要不要一起玩。
Although I haven't talked to her for a long time, I don't know if the relationship is the same as before, but I still have the courage to ask her if she wants to play with me.
从那之后，我便找到了一个有些“聒噪”的排遣方式，就是每天准时和她打游戏。
Since then, I have found a way to be boisterous, to play games with her on time every day.
每天下午三点开始，房间里我的笑声会淹没周围的一切。
Every day at 3 pm, my laughter in the room would drown out everything around me.
疫情中被废弃的小型游乐场不打游戏的时候我们就一起看《甄嬛传》，打游戏的时候就一起讲《甄嬛传》里的笑梗，好几次听她唱这首歌我都笑到脸疼，好几次我没辅助好，她就会突然冒出一句“你伺候本宫？”这样的日子让竟让我产生了一种回到高中时代的错觉。
Zhen Huan is an important part of the story of Zhen Huan when she is not playing games in the small amusement park. Huan Huan tells the story of Zhen Huan when we play Huan Huan. I laugh at her singing this song several times.
就好像，天真的少年一直住在我们心里，只要我们按下停止按钮，少年便不会长大，永远年轻，永远有趣。
As if, naive youth has always lived in our hearts, as long as we press the stop button, teenagers will not grow up, always young, always interesting.
【小区广播】@慕遥“各位业主现在是新型肺炎防控非常时期，请各位业主尽量少出门，多通风，勤洗手，戴口罩……”小区内的广播声会在每天下午四点准时响起。
"Owners are invited to stay away from home as little as possible, to be ventilated, to wash their hands frequently and to wear face masks..." The local radio will ring at 4: 00 pm every day.
保安大叔拎着喇叭，围着不大的中心花园走上一圈，完成今天的通知任务。
Security uncle carrying the horn, around the small central garden walk around the completion of today's notification mission.
正在剃头的保安大叔往常这个时候，篮球场上拍打篮球的声音已经清晰可闻，游乐区里孩子的嬉笑声和跷跷板弹簧的咿呀声此起彼伏。
At this time of year, the sound of basketball playing on the basketball court was clearly audible, and the children's laughter and seesaw springs in the Recreation Area gurgled.
春天本该是放纵欢愉的季节，而今年，寂静掩下喧嚣，空旷取代人潮。
Spring was supposed to be a season of indulgence, but this year silence reigned and emptiness took the place of crowds.
已近四月，春天还在奔赴而来的路上。
It was almost April, and spring was still on its way.
【消毒车BGM】@高雨欣从被“关”在家里开始，我对窗外的一切事情就变得充满兴趣（上一次有这种感觉还是在高三写作业的时候），而等待下午3点驶进小区的消毒车则成了我最快乐的事。
From the moment I was shut down at home, I became interested in everything out of the window (the last time I felt like writing my homework in my senior year), and waiting for the disinfectant car to drive into the community at 3 p. m. became my happiest thing.
当消毒车自带的BGM响起时，我就像个顿悟的信徒一样立刻跑到阳台安静地观摩。
When the sanitizer's BGM rings, I run out on the balcony like an enlightened believer and watch quietly.
我看到对面楼的某个叔叔和我一样积极的打开了窗，甚至还朝我挥了挥手。
I saw one of my uncles in the opposite building open the window as positively as I did, and waved to me.
在这个春天里难得的乐声中，我们都在贪婪地汲取着可以被感知到的细微的乐趣。
In the rare music of this spring, we are greedily absorbing the subtle pleasures that can be felt.
【小推车滚轮声】@Ailsa封城、封小区、自行采购变成了小区团购，每家每户每次的生活物资的采购数量之大，都仿佛要让家里成为“小型批发市场”，大量囤积生活物资，才能换取安心。
[trolley rollers] @ Ailsa closure, small areas, self-procurement into small group purchase, each household each time the purchase of supplies, as if to make the family into a "small wholesale market," large hoarding of supplies in exchange for peace of mind.
周围的人们都在自觉地减少出门次数，隔绝流动。
People around them are consciously reducing the number of journeys and isolating the flow.
平日待在家里，偶尔能听见小区里其他业主推着小推车出门，滚轮与地面摩擦的声音或由远及近、或由近及远，才真切感受到这座空荡的城市里依然有许多人在生活着。
Usually stay at home, occasionally can hear other owners in the neighborhood pushing the trolley out, the sound of roller and ground friction from far and near, or from far away, only to feel that there are still many people living in this empty city.
【钟声】@家乐福海盗夜里惊醒，万籁俱寂。
The buccaneers awoke at night in a profound silence.
躺在床上的我，第一次听到房间里3个钟秒针走动的声音。
Lying in bed, I first heard the sound of three minutes of needles moving around the room.
上学的时候，为了时刻提醒自己“时间不多了”，我把房间里的三个钟都调快了5～10分钟不等。
At school, to constantly remind myself that "time is running out," I set the three clocks in my room five to ten minutes fast.
大学毕业以后，从没有在家里住这么久，早已经忘了自己把钟调快过。
After graduating from college, I have never lived at home so long that I forgot to turn the clock on fast.
而那天晚上听到三个钟的嘀嗒声，才想起来。
And that night I heard the ticking of three clocks.
那天以后，这三个钟的存在感变强了。
After that day, the three clocks became stronger.
我会坐在书桌前，看着秒针走到12，分针离下一个数字又向前一步。
I would sit at my desk and watch the second hand go to 12 and the minute hand move the next number one step further.
在过去看来浪费时间的奢侈行为，成了这个春天里心安理得的休息行为。
Luxury, which seemed a waste of time in the past, became a restful repose in the spring.
毕竟，这个春天留给我们最多的就是时间。
After all, the most that spring has left us is time.
早上9点起床，9点半早餐、10点打扫房间，陪家人看半个小时新闻以后坐在书桌前开始工作或看书。
Get up at 9 a.m., breakfast at 9: 30, clean your room at 10, watch the news for half an hour with your family, and then sit at your desk and start working or reading.
下午2点吃饭，3点洗碗，3点半又坐回书桌前，直到晚上7点。
Eat at 2 pm, wash dishes at 3: 30 and sit back at your desk until 7 pm.
伴着新闻联播吃完晚餐后，8点健身，9点洗澡，9点半躺上床，看电影到12点，睡觉……如此，复制粘贴似的开始新的一天。
After dinner on the newscast, get to the gym at 8: 00, take a bath at 9: 30, go to bed at 9: 30, watch a movie at 12: 00, and go to bed.
这好像是一个拿时间没什么办法的春天，不过我们还有立下flag的习惯，只不过实施的时间变成了“解封以后”。
It's like a spring without time, but we're still in the habit of making flag, but the time of implementation becomes "unsealed."
你有没有发现，那些去年冬天不会做的事情，今年春天你仍然不会做。
Have you noticed that you still can't do the things you didn't do last winter this spring?
关在家里的我们就算把时间流逝的声音听得再清楚，也未曾把那些早都该做的事情提上日程。
Locked at home, even if we can hear the sound of time passing, we have not put on the agenda the things that should have been done long ago.
如果想做，你早都做了。
If you wanted to, you'd have done it.
