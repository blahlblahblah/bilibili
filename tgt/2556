《创新经济战疫计划》，是燃财经在新型肺炎疫情期间推出的特别栏目，关注创新经济企业遇到的新难题、商讨应该采取的新对策，希望能够帮助中小企业一起战胜挑战、把握机会。
The Innovation Economic Plague Program is a special section of the New Pneumonia Epidemic launched by FCI. It focuses on the new difficulties encountered by innovative economic enterprises, discusses new measures to be adopted, and hopes to help SMEs overcome challenges and seize opportunities together.
作者 | 金玙璠编辑 | 魏佳疫情危机之下，企业主扛起了继减员、降薪之后的第三道护身符——全员营销。
At the time of the Wei Jia epidemic, business owners have carried a third talisman - full-time marketing - following job losses and pay cuts.
继去年房企争相“全员卖房”之后，今年2月27日，有苏宁员工在社交媒体发布了一份苏宁“控股集团总裁办公室”的公告，公告称苏宁要求全产业每一位员工参与自有APP的线上推广和销售，要求3天内（2月27日-29日）人均完成保底2单，总金额达到1000元以上的销售，未完成的差额将作为处罚，从薪资中扣除。
On Feb. 27, after a scramble for full-time home sales, Suning employees issued a notice on social media saying that Suning required every employee in the industry to participate in the online promotion and sale of their own APP, requiring that every employee in three days (Feb. 27-29) complete the bottom two sales, the total amount of more than 1,000 yuan, the outstanding difference will be deducted from the salary.
从这份公告看，考核涉及的只有全产业的管理干部，但多名内部人士对燃财经称，非业务和销售岗的所有员工也有此要求。
According to the announcement, the assessment involved only management cadres in the industry, but several insiders told the Financial Times that all employees in non-business and sales posts were also required to do so.
苏宁员工爆料的公告截图来源 / 网络事实上，疫情之下，除了苏宁之外，大型房企、教育机构、361度及安踏等运动品牌也实行了“全员营销”策略，而据北森人才管理研究院透露，近期还有众多公司咨询全员营销事宜，预计2020年会有更多企业加入。
In fact, in addition to Suning, major housing companies, educational institutions, 361 degrees and Anta sports brands have adopted a "full-time marketing" strategy, while a number of companies have recently consulted about full-time marketing, and more are expected to join in 2020, according to the Nissan Institute of Talent Management.
多名员工表示，现在是特殊时期，公司要提高营业额能够理解，但不同岗位对人的专业甚至性格都有一定的要求，公司不能以完不成销售任务为由扣除工资，也是因此，苏宁这次“负激励”的政策引发了普遍关注。
A number of employees said it was a special time for the company to increase its turnover, but that different positions have certain requirements for people's specialties and even personality.
但在老板层面，燃财经采访的多位企业主均表示支持全员营销，只是有一定的适用范围，需要企业主在具体实施层面保持克制。
But at the boss level, a number of business owners interviewed by FCI expressed their support for full-time marketing, although with a certain scope of application that requires restraint on the part of business owners.
不过，对于职场人来说，最担心的是，拿着不变的薪水，却还要干销售岗的工作，甚至承担着KPI，会不会成为2020年的常态。
But what worries workers most is whether it will become the norm in 2020 to hold on to a steady paycheck while still doing sales jobs and even assuming a KPI.
事实上，无论企业是否实行全员营销，2020年的职场都不会太容易，疫情冲击之下，企业都在求变，尝试的可能是全员营销，也可能是其他的组织变革形式，你准备好了吗？“找不到人买就只能自己下单”李牧在苏宁武汉大区任职非销售岗位，疫情期间一直在家远程办公。
In fact, whether or not enterprises implement full-time marketing, the 2020 workplace will not be easy, the epidemic impact, companies are trying to change, may be trying full-time marketing, or other forms of organizational change, you ready? "Li Shu-Mu in Suning Wuhan region of non-sales posts, has been working remotely during the epidemic.
据他回忆，他所在的大区于2月13日第一次发布带单考核方案，要求所有岗位员工每人每天完成2单、单笔订单金额50元以上的推客任务，因为他本人和亲戚朋友身在武汉，电商平台的订单基本是不发货状态，想要完成推客任务很难，他最终靠着让亲朋好友充话费才完成任务。
He recalled that on February 13, his region issued its first tweeting program, which requires all employees to complete 2 tweets a day or more per person for a single order of 50 yuan or more, because he and his relatives and friends were in Wuhan.
让他不能接受的是，2月27日集团又叠加下发了“3天完成1000元”的销售任务，明确规定“充话费”不算在内。
To his disapproval, on Feb. 27, the group superimposed a sales task of "3 days to complete 1000 yuan", specifying that "charges" were not included.
“完不成的部分美其名曰‘负激励’，其实就是从工资里扣钱，我刚毕业一年，工资也没有几个一千，这两天只能找外地的朋友帮忙。
In fact, I just graduated one year after graduation, and I haven't got many thousand dollars, so I can only turn to friends from other places for help.
”李牧告诉燃财经。
Li Mu told Flaming Finance.
来源 / 受访者提供来源 / 受访者提供“疫情期间企业很难，但员工也不容易，现在这种形势下，武汉大区所有员工心理压力本来就很大，企业还推行这样的政策，真的寒心了。
Source / Interviewee: Source / Interviewee: It is difficult for enterprises during the epidemic period, but it is not easy for employees. In the present situation, all the employees in Wuhan are already under great psychological pressure.
”李牧说，希望公司能听到同事们的心声。
Li said he hoped the company could hear the voices of its colleagues.
多位苏宁员工也向燃财经表示，他们的岗位原本是物管、财务、人事、客服，但是从2月份开始，每天都背负着推客考核任务，同事们每天都会在朋友圈发布一定数量的购买链接，如今又新增了“3天1000元”的销售任务，作为非销售人员没有目标客户群体，多数人选择找亲戚朋友帮忙，实在没有人买了，就只能自己下单。
A number of Suning employees also told Flaming Finance that their jobs were originally physical management, finance, personnel and customer service, but since February, they are burdened with daily customer reviews, colleagues are posting a certain number of links to friends every day, and now a new "3-day 1000 yuan" sales task, as non-sales people do not target customers, most people choose to help relatives, really no one has to order.
苏宁南京大区的苏肖晨心态更加悲观，“3天卖货1000元以上，这摆明了是大多数普通员工不可能完成的任务，公司就有理由少发工资，你如果完成任务了，公司销售额增加1000元。
The SuXiao Chen mentality in Nanjing, Suning, is more pessimistic, "3 days to sell more than 1,000 yuan, which shows that most ordinary employees are impossible tasks, the company is justified to pay less wages, if you completed the task, the company sales increased 1000 yuan.
”2019年8月22日全国工商联发布的《2019年中国民营企业500强报告》中显示，苏宁的员工总数是25.68万人。
The 2019 report by the All-China Federation of Commerce and Industry on the Top 500 Private Enterprises in China for 2019 shows that the total number of employees in Suning is 256,800.
按此人数计算，如果每位员工完成1000元的卖货任务，公司销售额将增加2.5亿。
Based on this figure, the company's sales would increase by 250 million if each employee completed the $1,000 sales task.
苏宁这一次的行为已引发舆论关注，苏宁官方回应称，宅经济大背景下，此举可更好地了解用户需求优化体验，未来将持续发力全民营销，并披露了相关数据——2月27日0点至24点，苏宁“24期免息”活动中的订单量同比增长7倍，其中社群营销销售额贡献率超过30%。
Su Ning this time action has aroused public concern, Su Ning official response to the general background of the home economy, the home needs optimization experience, will continue to make efforts to promote national marketing, and disclosed the relevant data - February 27 0-24, Suning "24 interest-free" activities orders increased seven times year-on-year, with community marketing sales contributing more than 30%.
苏宁全员营销的效果毋庸置疑，但是从源头看，对非销售岗位制定销售任务，且有惩罚制度，是否符合劳动法规定呢？燃财经就此咨询了多位律师。
There is no doubt about the effect of full-time sales in Suning, but from the source, non-sales jobs set up sales tasks, and whether the punishment system, in accordance with labor law?
北京盈科（上海）律师事务所全球合伙人郭韧律师认为劳动法规定企业有权调岗，但不可强迫非销售岗位员工完成销售任务，而作为非销售岗位员工可以拒绝完成销售任务，公司不能以未完成销售任务为由解聘非销售岗位员工，如果以此为由被罚款可以维权。
Guo Tou, a global partner at PCCW, a Beijing law firm, argues that the labor law entitles companies to transfer workers, but not to force non-sales employees to complete sales tasks. As non-sales employees, the company cannot dismiss non-sales employees for not completing sales tasks, and can be fined to defend their rights.
但她也坦言，员工维权难度较大，此类案件多以协调解决。
But she also admitted that it is difficult for employees to defend their rights and that such cases are often resolved in a coordinated manner.
该所另一名合伙人胡郁舒律师同样表示，如果非销售岗位员工（劳动合同内写明其主要劳动内容，且劳动内容不包括销售）提供了劳动合同内约定的劳动内容，那么单位就不能以未完成销售任务为由扣除工资，这属于违法行为。
Lawyer Hu Yu-shu, another partner at the institute, also said that it was illegal for a company to deduct wages for non-completion of sales tasks if the non-sales staff provided the labor contract with its main labor content, and the labor contract did not include sales.
疫情下，逃不掉的游戏规则事实上，“全员营销”的公司远不止苏宁一家，这种方式早已是房地产行业内的通行做法，而且房企动员营销的范围更广，不但调动员工，业主、合作伙伴都可以加入“销售”行列，通过促进成交，获得一定比例的佣金。
In fact, the "all-hands marketing" approach has long been the norm in the real estate industry, and the broader scope of housing enterprise mobilization marketing, not only mobilize staff, owners, partners can join the "sales" to facilitate the transaction, a certain proportion of the commission.
房企的玩法不外乎让全部员工在社交平台转发楼盘促销信息，通过人海战略带动公司营销，以恒大为例，全员营销的激励多于处罚：每个月各部门排名，前三名的部门会有工资20%左右的额外奖金，前10名也有；排名最后的三个部门，部分负责人会被扣罚5%的工资，并做检讨。
For example, every month departments rank, the top three departments will receive an extra bonus of about 20% of their salaries, and some of the top three will be fined 5% of their salaries and reviewed.
某房企策划何靖告诉燃财经，对房企来说，全员营销一般适用于淡季营销，比如年底的最后一个季度，可以摊薄企业成本，提高项目曝光度。
A housing enterprise planning Ho Jing told Flaming Finance, for housing companies, full-time marketing is generally applicable to off-season marketing, such as the last quarter of the year, can dilute enterprise costs, improve project visibility.
对于员工来说，没有KPI，卖出去一套还能拿提点，因此在房地产行业早已成为常态，但是今年受疫情影响，年初就开始了，都是为了现金流。
For employees, selling one without KPI is the norm, so it has long been the norm in the real estate sector, but it started early this year because of the epidemic, all for cash flow.
何靖所在的公司一直有一个“老带新”的推荐系统，想赚佣金的同事就参与。
He Jing in the company has always had a "old with new" referral system, want to earn commissions colleagues to participate.
不过何靖表示，自己和同事平时工作量已经很饱和，且个人朋友圈子也不属于客户群，所以平时积极性不高。
However, He Jing said that he and his colleagues are usually very saturated workload, and personal friends do not belong to the customer base, so usually not active.
现在疫情来了，集团层面推出了“员工千元预定房源”的活动，员工每人交1000元预定一套房源，这套房源由个人出去销售，成交后，公司除了返还1000元预定金之外，还会支付和销售岗位同等比例的佣金，并额外补偿1000元；未成交，也会返还预定金。
Now the epidemic has come, the group level launched the "staff 1000 yuan reservation source" activities, each staff members pay 1000 yuan to book a suite source, the suites source by individuals to sell, after the transaction, the company will return 1000 yuan in addition to the advance, the company will pay the same proportion of sales posts and compensation 1000 yuan.
图 / 视觉中国不过，公司未就此事和员工签订合同，何靖担心返还预定金的时间无法保证。
Photo / Vision China However, the company did not sign a contract with the staff on this matter, He Jing worried that the return of the advance time can not be guaranteed.
她回忆，此前分公司也要求员工预定房源，她交的5000元定金在半年后才返还。
She recalled that the previous branch also required staff to book housing resources, she paid a deposit of 5000 yuan in six months before returning.
“同事总体上不是非常反感，疫情短时间不会结束，也不会因为1000块做什么冲动的举动，大家都知道身处这个行业、这个组织，都得遵守游戏规则。
"Colleagues are not generally repulsive, the epidemic is not going to end anytime soon, nor is it going to be an impulse to do anything about $1,000. Everyone knows that in this industry, in this organization, you have to play by the rules.
”何靖说，其实全员营销在房地产行业就是圈层营销，也就是老带新，但是同事多数不属于业主的圈层，手里也没有销售资源，只能用私人时间尽力去开拓。
'In fact, full-time marketing in the real estate industry is ring marketing, that is, old with new, but most of the colleagues do not belong to the circle of owners, there are no sales resources, can only use their private time to explore.
何靖判断，未来大型房企会把“全员营销”政策制定得更加激进，而且会作为更加常态化的玩法。
He Jing judges that future large-scale housing companies will "full marketing" policy more aggressive, and will play as a more normal way.
不过在她看来，让员工自己掏钱预定房源的做法，对企业来说百利而无一害，但是对于行业发展不是件好事——“拿某知名房企来说，看市场数据卖出了很多套房，但实际上有很多压在内部员工、老业主手里。
But, in her view, letting employees book out of their own pocket is good for the business, but not for the industry - "In the case of a well-known housing company that sells a lot of suites based on market data, there's a lot of pressure on in-house workers, old owners."
”北森人才管理研究院院长周丹称，全员营销的理念在快消、餐饮、保险、信用卡、房企这些行业是非常常见的，主要适用于销售产品形态相对普适的公司。
Zhou Dan, director of the Beisen Institute for Talent Management, said the concept of full-time marketing was common in sectors such as fast-moving, catering, insurance, credit cards and housing, and was mainly applicable to companies selling products with relatively universal patterns.
“如今，受疫情影响，很多组织前端的收入开始下降，整个组织经营面临着巨大的困难，压强也会传导到中后端，这种情况下，全员营销是以整个组织能力去对抗业绩下滑的方式。
"Now, because of the epidemic, revenue at the front end of many organizations is beginning to decline, the whole organization is facing enormous difficulties in operating, and the pressure is transmitted to the middle and back end. In this case, full-time marketing is the way to fight the decline in performance with the ability of the entire organization.
”周丹对燃财经分析，“好处非常明显，首先，当大部队全员压向一线，利于各个部门加强协作配合，其次，如果企业文化价值观的底子不错，当发生危机时采用全员营销，可以动员全员的士气。
"The benefits are obvious," Zhou said of the financial analysis. "First, when large units are pressed to the front line, enabling departments to work more cooperatively, and secondly, if the foundation of corporate cultural values is good, full-time marketing can be used to mobilize all staff morale in a crisis."
”运动品牌就是典型的例子，据燃财经了解，目前多个运功品牌已经启动了全员营销，他们的员工近日都在朋友圈等社交平台发布产品及优惠信息。
Sports brands are a case in point, according to Combustion Engines, which has launched full-time marketing campaigns and whose employees have been posting products and promotional offers on social platforms such as friends' circles.
运动品牌361度发布公告表示，疫情将对2020年上半年的财务表现造成一定影响，为弥补疫情给终端销售造成的影响，集团将部分销售转移至电商平台上，发起全员营销的号召，并新开发了“微信小程序”以增强在线营销。
Sports brand 361 degrees said the epidemic would have an impact on financial performance in the first half of 2020. To compensate for the impact of the epidemic on end sales, the group shifted some sales to electrical platforms, launched full-time marketing calls and developed new 'micro-programs' to boost online marketing.
同样，安踏集团董事局主席兼CEO丁世忠在内部信中透露，“面对疫情影响，安踏与其他品牌一样，将经营的主战场转向线上，安踏也通过全员参与零售”。
Similarly, Ding Shizhong, chairman and CEO of Anta Group, revealed in an internal letter that "Anta, like other brands, is turning its main battleground to the line of business in the face of the epidemic."
安踏方面也透露，从2月1日起，已有超过3万名员工及经销商伙伴参与到“全员零售”项目。
Anta also revealed that since February 1, more than 30,000 employees and dealer partners have participated in the "retail staff" program.
除此之外，疫情之下，线下教育企业受到的冲击也非常严重。
In addition, under the epidemic, the impact on the offline education enterprises is also very serious.
某老牌教育培训机构的员工近日向燃财经反映，校区要求老师转型销售，全员卖课，提成日结。
The staff of a well-established educational and training institution recently reported to the burning economy that the campus required teachers to transform sales, sell classes, commission.
全员营销怎么玩？老板保持克制，员工心态开放对于全员营销这件事，老板们怎么想？全员营销最著名的操盘手恐怕是稻盛和夫了，他曾说过“企业萧条期，全体员工必须成为销售员”，他坚定地认为，面对不景气，首先该强调的就是全员营销，这也成为众多企业主的“圣经”。
What do bosses think about full-time marketing The best-known manipulator is Haruhiro Inamori, who once said, "In a recession, all employees have to be salespeople." He firmly believes that in the face of the downturn, the emphasis should be on full-time marketing, which has become a bible for many business owners.
“可能有一些人认为全员营销不是好办法，追求的是短期效应，但我反而觉得是一个好事情，让后台一方面更理解前台的辛苦，另一方面对客户有更深的感知。
"There may be people who think full-time marketing is not a good way to pursue a short-term effect, but I think it's a good thing that the backstage has a better understanding of the grind and a deeper appreciation of the customer."
”智联招聘CEO郭盛对燃财经分析，适用与否其实不取决于行业，而与组织形态有关，当一个组织的形态是以客户为中心，价值观是为客户创造价值，那么就可以适用全员营销。
Whether Guo Sheng, the recruitment chief executive, applies to the analysis of fuel finance is not really a matter of industry, but of organizational form, which applies when an organization takes a customer-centric shape and values create value for its customers.
他也提醒企业主，虽然适用范围很广，但不分析情况就这么做，可能是病急乱投医。
He also reminded business owners that, while the scope of application was very broad, doing so without analysing the situation could lead to ill health.
十号街商城创始人陈克勇认为，不能有些企业这么做了或者取得成功了，就以偏概全认为是真理，全员营销只适用于销售贸易型公司，也就是全前台化、中台和后台比例不高的公司。
Chen Keyong, founder of the mall on 10th Street, said: 'Some companies can't do this or succeed, they just take it for granted. Full-time marketing only applies to sales-oriented companies, that is, companies with a low proportion of front-office, middle-office and back-office.
他建议企业主要考虑到不同岗位员工的销售时间是否充裕，是否有销售平台和目标客户资源。
He advises companies to consider whether employees in different positions have enough time to sell, whether there are sales platforms and target customer resources.
“如果我们公司使用全员销售，会设置奖励，但不会设置KPI和惩罚，目的也是让员工身边的人使用公司的产品和服务，听到更真实的反馈。
"If we use full-time sales, we set incentives, but not KPI and penalties, to get people around us to use the company's products and services and get more real feedback."
”陈克勇对燃财经表示，全员营销不应该是KPI，否则首先受影响的将是本职岗位，工作效率大打折扣，对企业来说，得不偿失，而且利用员工个人的私域流量来打通销售，效能较低，规模有限，不能持续，非企业首选。
Mr Chen told FCC that full-time marketing should not be KPI, otherwise the first to be affected would be the job itself, which would be less efficient, less cost-effective for the company, and less efficient, limited-scale, unsustainable and non-business-first-come-first-served.
从长远来看，专业分工才能获得好效率。
In the long run, specialization can achieve good efficiency.
图 / 视觉中国全员营销之所以引发争议，甚至给企业主带来困扰和挑战，并不是因为这个方向有问题，而是因为部分企业主的认知误区，在执行过程中走样了。
Graphic / Visual China's full-time marketing has caused controversy and even brought trouble and challenge to business owners, not because of the problem in this direction, but because some business owners misunderstand, in the process of implementation.
“很多中国企业有个误区，认为销售是人人都可以干的，但事实上，这个岗位的专业性绝不亚于任何一个其他的专业工种。
"There is a myth among many Chinese companies that sales can be done by everyone, but in fact the position is no less professional than any other profession.
”周丹表示。
Zhou Dan said.
她解释，全员营销分为“营”和“销”，一般企业对非销售岗位人员的预期就是“营”，也就是让更多人知道，这相对更容易实现；如果企业想达到的效果是“销”，把产品销售出去，那就意味着要让员工背KPI，这就要考虑整个组织文化、员工的向心力如何，如果强行上全员营销，让非销售岗位的人临时进入销售场景可能还会产生一些负面后果，比如中后台的人员大量流失，或者员工在过程中有很多软抵抗，不但企业很难有收益，而且会对组织产生更大的破坏力。
She explains that full-time marketing is divided into "battalion" and "sales." The average business expects people in non-sales positions to "camp," that is, to let more people know that this is relatively easy to achieve.
通常来说，全员营销更适用于短期使用，比如基于某个单品、某个关键战役，产品最好也是普适性的；对于体量规模偏大的公司而言，把员工当作一种人才资源和渠道去释放出去，效果也更好。
Generally speaking, full-time marketing is more suitable for short-term use, such as a product based on a single item, a key campaign, and preferably generic; for larger companies, it is better to release staff as a human resource and channel.
她建议，在全员营销过程中，如果要对员工下指标，更适合下行为指标，而不是结果指标，比如发朋友圈、集多少赞，拜访多少客户等，而不是拿到多少销量。
In full-time marketing, she suggests, indicators of behavior, rather than outcome indicators, such as how many friends you have, how many customers you visit, rather than how much you sell.
如果一定要下结果指标，最好不要下到个人，而是下到更大的单元，比如下到团队，或者让中后台员工和销售结对子，联合去打单。
If outcome indicators are necessary, it is best not to go down to the individual, but to larger units, such as the next team, or to have a middle- and back-office staff and a sales pair to work together.
尤其不建议企业主采用极端的方式，比如对单独的个人进行惩罚，这不但涉及到公平性的问题，也会极大挫伤非销售岗位人员的积极性，一旦形成抵触情绪，对整个组织也是弊大于利。
In particular, extreme forms of punishment of individual entrepreneurs, such as individual sanctions, are not only a matter of fairness, but also a major disincentive for non-sales staff, which, once created, can do more harm than good for the organization as a whole.
周丹坦言，目前正在向她咨询准备采用全员营销的企业确实不少，2020年会有更多企业加入，原来只有大企业做，可能今年一些小企业也会尝试。
Chou admits she is being asked about the number of companies that are ready to adopt full-time marketing and that more companies will join in 2020, instead of just big companies, and maybe some small businesses will try this year.
她建议职场人做好心理准备，企业尝试的可能是全员营销，也可能是其他的组织变革形式，职场人应该抱有更开放的心态，当然也不要因此割裂对岗位的认知。
She advises workers to be prepared for the possibility of full-time marketing or other forms of organizational change, and to be more open-minded about their jobs.
“我们调研发现，组织对员工的要求，要么专，要么全，这个趋势是职场人一定要面对的，要么提高某个专项上的专业度，成为高精尖人才，要么在基础职位上提高综合能力。
"Our research shows that organizations demand of employees, either exclusively or completely, that this trend must be faced by people in the workplace, either to improve their professionalism in a particular field, to become highly skilled personnel, or to improve their overall competence in basic positions.
