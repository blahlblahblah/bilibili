文/范欣3月以来，美股接连发生熔断，让全球投资者都惊出了一身冷汗，连股神巴菲特都惊叹“活久见”，芝加哥期权交易所（CBOE）恐慌指数VIX也在3月17日超过2008年金融危机时的高点，创下收盘记录新高。
(Warren Buffett) Buffett, the stock market god, has been stunned by the meltdown that has engulfed US stocks since March, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Panic Index reaching a record close on March 17, surpassing its peak at the 2008 financial crisis.
受此影响，连黄金、白银、石油、比特币等全球各类避险资产短期都遭到了恐慌性、踩踏式抛售，日本、欧洲各国等全球主要股指均连续大跌。
As a result, even gold, silver, oil, Bitcoin and other global risk-averse assets were short-term panic, stampede selling, Japan, European countries and other major global stock index fell.
更为严重的是，为应对流动性危机，美联储当地时间15日紧急降息，将联邦基金利率目标区间下调至0～0.25%的超低水平，并启动7000亿美元量化宽松计划，可谓是一次性“all in”打出了短期货币政策的所有子弹，但市场似乎对此并不买账，随后开盘的美股再次熔断，毫无疑问，发达国家正在经历一场流动性危机。
More seriously, in response to the liquidity crisis, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate target to the ultra-low level of 0-0.25% and launched a $700 billion quantitative easing program, which seemed to be a one-off "all in" short-term monetary policy.
这其中的直接原因无非是疫情全球扩散，在疫苗制作出来之前阻断该病毒的传播最有效的方式无疑是大幅减少人与人之间的接触，而欧美国家经济主要依赖消费拉动，大幅减少人与人之间的接触无疑将在短期内压制总需求，受冲击较大的行业包括旅游、餐饮、文体、交通等，总需求的减少会直接导致上市公司盈利能力大幅下降，整体经济增速也将随之下降。
The immediate cause of this is simply the global spread of the epidemic. The most effective way to stop the spread of the virus before a vaccine is produced is undoubtedly to reduce human-to-people contact, which will undoubtedly suppress aggregate demand in the short run, including tourism, catering, sports, transportation, etc.
比如苹果公司，疫情不仅影响到其全球生产链条，更影响到其销售，近期苹果公司就宣布将会关闭大中华区以外的所有零售店；再比如星巴克，仅2月在中国的同店销售额较去年同期就跌掉了78%，由此可预计其未来几个月在全球的销量下降幅度。
At Apple, for example, the epidemic is affecting not only its global production chain, but also its sales, with Apple recently announcing that it will close all retail outlets outside Greater China. For example, Starbucks, for example, lost 78% of its sales in China in February alone compared with the same period last year, predicting a decline in global sales in the coming months.
短期资本市场大幅下挫的逻辑逐渐清晰：总需求减少使上市公司盈利能力快速下降，上市公司股价下跌导致市场风险偏好下降，货币资金需求上升，抛售股票最先让高杠杆群体保证金输完，随后产生踩踏现象，其他资产价格随之下跌。
The logic behind the sharp decline in short-term capital markets has become clear: declining aggregate demand has led to a rapid decline in the profitability of listed companies, a decline in market risk appetite owing to falling stock prices, an increase in the demand for money, a sell-off of stocks that led to the loss of highly leveraged margin, followed by a stampede and subsequent falls in other asset prices.
因而，发达国家各大央行“降息+QE”的政策对补充市场流动性短期的确是有一定好处的。
Thus, central banks in the developed world "cut interest rates + QE" policy to supplement market liquidity in the short term is indeed beneficial.
但是货币政策并非万能，短期流动性危机的根本原因还在于过去十年资本市场泡沫过多以及自身经济结构出现的问题。
But monetary policy is not a panacea, and the root cause of the short-term liquidity crisis has been excessive capital-market bubbles over the past decade and problems with its own economic structure.
美国股市自2009年以来走出了10年牛市，道琼斯指数自2009年初最低点至今年年初最高点上涨超3倍，纳斯达克指数上涨超6倍。
The U.S. stock market has emerged from a 10-year bull market since 2009, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than tripling from its lowest point in early 2009 to its peak earlier this year, and the Nasdaq up more than six times.
美国股市上涨的初期还主要是由于金融危机后经济复苏带来的上市公司盈利恢复，中后期则主要是因为宽松的货币环境和较低的利率环境下上市公司通过资本市场融资回购股票，以及一些处于亏损的公司和盈利并不强的公司还就此增大分红比例形成财富效应所致。
The initial rise in the US stock market was also mainly due to the recovery of earnings of listed companies following the financial crisis, while in the middle and late period it was mainly due to the easy monetary environment and lower interest rates in which listed companies financed share buybacks through capital markets, as well as the wealth effect of some loss-making companies and less profitable ones.
也可以说市场投资者在此阶段赚的更多的是货币宽松的钱，而非企业真实盈利的钱。
It can also be said that market investors at this stage of the money is more money loose money than the real profits of the enterprise.
这种情况下任何黑天鹅的出现无疑对股市都是致命打击，此前几年一些知名投资者每年均曾做过美股见顶的预言也是看到了这一问题的存在。
Any appearance of a black swan in this scenario would be a fatal blow to the stock market, as seen in the annual US cap-and-trade predictions made by prominent investors in previous years.
在经济结构上，近年来支撑发达国家经济发展的诸多因素都在发生悄然的改变，在人口结构上的人口老龄化问题越来越严重、科技的进步近年来又踟蹰不前导致生产效率无法大幅度提升，发达国家为了维持经济潜在增长而不得不过于依赖货币政策，简单说就是压低利率甚至不惜采取负利率后加大举债力度，而货币过于宽松又推高了资产价格，加剧了贫富差距。
In recent years, the factors supporting the economic development of the developed countries have been changing stealthily. The aging of the population, the stagnation of technology in recent years have made it impossible to increase productivity. To maintain potential economic growth, developed countries must rely too much on monetary policy.
统计显示，美国最富1%家庭拥有的资产总和几乎与美国整个中产和中上阶层所拥有的财富总额相同。
The richest 1 percent of households in the United States combined own almost as much wealth as the middle and upper middle classes, according to the statistics.
过于悬殊的贫富差距对扩大总需求是十分不利的，底层居民有消费意愿而无消费能力。
The disparity between the rich and the poor is very unfavorable to the expansion of aggregate demand.
这点从近期桑德斯参加民主党初选时所提出的系列税收措施受到很多美国普通民众的追捧就能看出些许端倪。
This is reflected in the series of tax measures that Sanders proposed when he went to the Democratic primary, which many ordinary Americans admire.
从上述逻辑观察，此次疫情只是引爆美股的一个导火索而非根本原因，因而，在加大力度有效控制疫情的基础上，救助方式也不能仅局限于货币政策。
From the above-mentioned logic, the outbreak is only a trigger, not a root cause, to trigger the U. S. stock market. Therefore, in order to strengthen efforts to effectively control the epidemic, the way to help can not be limited to monetary policy.
货币政策仅仅是解决短期市场流动危机的特效药而非治疗药物，更何况该特效药应用多年后药效已经大打折扣。
Monetary policy is only a panacea for short-term market-flow crises, not a cure, not least because the effects of the specific drug have been eroded over the years.
根据费雪方程式：货币供应量（M）x货币流通速度（V）= 物价（P）x 产量（Q）。
According to the Fisher equation: money supply (M) x money velocity (V) = price (P) x production (Q).
在总需求因疫情影响不能扩大的背景下，加快货币投放可能会降低货币流通速度，而非提高物价或产量增加，考虑到当前美国非金融企业杠杆率处于历史高位，企业和居民增加贷款的意愿都不会很强，这会让多投放的货币可能会积压在银行，达不到刺激经济和资本市场的效果。
With aggregate demand unable to expand as a result of the epidemic, faster money delivery may slow money flows rather than increase prices or output, and, given the historically high leverage of US non-financial businesses, businesses and residents will be less willing to lend more, leaving more money to accumulate in banks than in stimulating the economy and capital markets.
因而，要想实现短期提振经济的效果还必须配合财政政策使用，与其让货币淤积在金融市场，还不如将货币直接派发给居民。
Thus, short-term economic-boosting effects must also be matched by fiscal policy, which, instead of silting up the financial markets, should deliver the money directly to the population.
当年伯南克提出的“直升机撒钱”政策当下就是很好的选项，即在央行实行零利率或接近零利率的措施后，以税收返还或其他名义直接补贴家庭或消费者的方式。
Bernanke's "helicopter-money" policy is now a good option, in the form of tax rebates or other forms of direct subsidies to households or consumers, after the central bank has imposed zero or near-zero interest rates.
近期美媒就报道美国可能推出一项大规模刺激政策，其中就包括向每个美国公民发放1000美元支票。
The US media recently reported that the US could launch a massive stimulus package that would include issuing $1,000 of checks to every American citizen.
此外，如果美国能放开相关贸易保护主义政策对于刺激其国内消费也会起到良好作用。
Moreover, if the US were to liberalize protectionist policies, it would do well to boost domestic consumption.
当然，短期货币和财政刺激政策只能是临时性措施，如将短期政策用于长期则会让未来的问题更加复杂、解决难度更大，对全球整体经济金融影响更为深远。
Of course, short-term monetary and fiscal stimulus can only be temporary, and using short-term policies for the long term will make future problems more complex, more difficult to resolve, and have far-reaching global economic and financial implications.
从长期讲，改变收入分配结构、补充底层购买力、改变债务驱动型增长方式才是解决问题之根本。
In the long run, changing the structure of income distribution, supplementing underlying purchasing power, and changing the debt-driven growth pattern are fundamental.
