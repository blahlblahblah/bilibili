参与中国欧盟商会与中国德国商会调研的577家企业中，大约一半预计2020年上半年营收会下跌超过10%，四分之一预计营收下滑超过20%。
About half of the 577 companies surveyed by the European Chamber of Commerce in China and the German Chamber of Commerce in China expect revenues to fall by more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2020 and a quarter expect revenues to fall by more than 20 per cent.
有46%的企业预计2020年的经营业绩将不及预期，约五分之一的企业预计业绩仍能达标韩舒淋| 文马克 | 编辑中国欧盟商会与中国德国商会27日发布的一份联合调研报告显示，大约9成的在华欧洲企业认为新冠肺炎疫情对企业造成了中度到重度影响，企业主要面临的挑战包括规则的不确定性，严格的隔离要求和复工要满足大量要求。
About 90 per cent of European companies in China think the new crown pneumonia epidemic is having a moderate to severe impact on companies, with uncertainty about rules, strict quarantine requirements and heavy demands to get back to work, according to a joint survey released yesterday by the European Chamber of Commerce and the German Chamber of Commerce.
报告还提醒，在中美贸易摩擦和疫情爆发影响下，许多欧洲企业开始担忧对中国过度依赖，开始将多元化纳入优先考虑，这提醒中国应该继续推进改革和对外开发进程，增加市场的吸引力。
The report also warns that many European companies are starting to worry about overdependence on China and are giving priority to diversification in the wake of trade frictions and outbreaks of disease between the two countries, reminding China that it should continue its reform and external development process to make the market more attractive.
中国欧盟商会主席Joerg Wuttke表示，新冠肺炎疫情给对许多企业在市场预测方面上一课，并可能导致一些企业脱离单一市场，在中国乃至更大范围内寻求多元化。
Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, said the outbreak had taught many companies a lesson in market forecasting and could lead some to diversify away from the single market and into China and beyond.
这份报告由中国欧盟商会和中国德国商会联合调研得出，共有两家商会的共577家会员企业参与了调研，调研时间为2月21日至28日。
The study, conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce of China and the German Chamber of Commerce of China, involved 577 member companies of two chambers of commerce from February 21 to 28.
参与调研的企业在华分布广泛，其中以德国企业为主，主要分布在机械装备、汽车、商业服务、消费产品等各个领域。
The enterprises participating in the survey are widely distributed in China, among which German enterprises are mainly distributed in various fields such as machinery, automobile, commercial service and consumer products.
根据报告，在疫情及防控措施影响下，所有受调研企业都认为受到了影响，其中59%的受调研企业认为影响严重，30%的企业认为影响程度中等，7%的企业受影响程度较小，还有4%的企业还难以评估。
According to the report, all the enterprises surveyed felt affected by the epidemic and its prevention and control measures, of which 59 per cent considered the impact severe, 30 per cent medium impact, 7 per cent less affected and 4 per cent difficult to assess.
受疫情影响，在华欧洲企业的业绩预计也将明显下滑。
European companies in China are also expected to see a marked decline in performance as a result of the epidemic.
报告显示，大约一半的被调研企业预计2020年上半年营收会下跌超过10%，四分之一的企业营收下滑超过20%。
About half of the companies surveyed expect revenues to fall by more than 10 per cent in the first half of 2020 and a quarter by more than 20 per cent, according to the report.
有46%的企业预计2020年的经营业绩将不及预期，另外还有28%的企业暂时难以预计，仅有大约五分之一的企业预计业绩能够达到目标。
Forty-six per cent of companies are expected to underperform in 2020, and another 28 per cent are temporarily unpredictable, with only about a fifth expected to do so.
此外，商业服务、消费品和电子产品领域的企业预计业绩受影响最严重。
In addition, firms in business services, consumer goods and electronics are expected to suffer the most.
疫情和防控措施对市场需求、供应链和人流的影响也影响着在华欧洲企业。
The epidemic and the impact of control measures on market demand, supply chains and people flow also affect European enterprises in China.
报告表示，供应链遭受了严重的破坏，46%的企业市场需求剧减，且面临供应链不稳定的问题。
The report says supply chains have been severely disrupted, with demand for 46 per cent of companies falling sharply and facing supply chain instability.
人员流动和防控措施是另一大问题，46%的企业面临缺少工人的困难，还有30%的企业在防疫物资方面有困难。
Mobility and control measures were another major problem, with 46 per cent of enterprises facing difficulties in finding workers and another 30 per cent having difficulties with epidemic prevention materials.
而不同行业的企业受到的影响又不尽相同。
Companies in different industries have been affected differently.
对于商业服务公司，由于可以远程办公，只有17%的企业面临缺少员工的困难，而在机械制造领域的公司，有这一困难的比例高达72%。
In the case of commercial service companies, only 17 per cent of enterprises face difficulties in finding employees owing to the possibility of telecommuting, compared with 72 per cent of companies in the field of machine-building.
而另一方面，一半的服务公司都面临现金流的困难，与之相比，汽车制造业领域只有三分之一有现金流问题。
On the other hand, half of all service companies face cash flow difficulties, compared with just one-third of auto makers.
报告分析，商业服务公司一半规模较小，难以像大型汽车厂那样应对现金流问题，而且大型汽车企业也更容易获得融资支持。
The report analyzes that half of the commercial-services companies are small, struggling to cope with cash-flow problems like large car plants, and that large car companies have easier access to financing.
企业间紧密的产业链使得任何一家公司都不能单独复工，它还需要供应、市场、物流、人才等各种要素才能真正真正运作起来，这也使得市场难以恢复。
The tight industrial chain between enterprises makes it impossible for any company to go back to work alone. It also requires supply, marketing, logistics and talent to be truly operational, which makes it difficult for markets to recover.
报告显示，44%的企业面临业务和投资决策的不确定性。
The report shows that 44 per cent of companies face uncertainty in their business and investment decisions.
在复工方面，在华欧洲企业面临着国内企业类似的困境。
European companies in China face similar difficulties in resuming work.
报告表示，企业在复工方面面临许多不确定性，在不同地区、不同层级的政府之间规则差异大，并且经常变化。
The report says businesses face many uncertainties about returning to work and that rules vary widely and frequently from region to region and from level to level of government.
许多企业在复工前遵守了相应规则，但要求可能每天都在变化。
Many businesses comply with the rules before going back to work, but the requirements may change every day.
在人员方面，各地的隔离要求也不尽相同，无论是回家复工的人员，还是本身在外的人员，都面临模糊不确定的规则问题。
In terms of personnel, the requirements for segregation also vary from place to place, and there are vague and uncertain rules, both for those returning to work and for those outside.
中国欧盟商会主席Joerg Wuttke表示，在应对疫情过程中，各地出台了彼此不同的政策，实际上产生了数百个“自治区”，这使得人流物流几乎中断；在抗击疫情依然是最重要的任务背景下，各主要地区应该优先统一政策来促使经济回到正轨。
Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, said different policies had been introduced to deal with the epidemic, effectively creating hundreds of "autonomous regions," which had virtually cut off the flow of people and logistics.
报告还建议，无论国内还是海外企业，遭受疫情影响后，税收减免、短期信贷展期、免收通行费、减少政府管理收费等政策都大有帮助。
The report also suggests that tax breaks, short-term extensions of credit, waivers of tolls and reductions in government management fees could go a long way when businesses, both domestic and overseas, are affected by the epidemic.
此外，中小企业面临的风险最大，应该特别关注。
In addition, SMEs are at greatest risk and deserve special attention.
