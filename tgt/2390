作者：彭梁洁来源：商业人物（ID：biz-leaders）壹赵倩最近一次执行飞行任务已经是一个月之前的事儿了。
Author: Peng Liangjie Source: Business Personage (ID: biz-leaders) One Zhao Qian's last mission was a month ago.
那是大年三十儿，返乡高峰的最后一天，赵倩执飞的737—800型客机搭载了150名乘客，上座率达到90%。
It was the 30th anniversary of the Chinese New Year and the last day of the homecoming rush. Zhao Qian's 737-800 carried 150 passengers, a 90% attendance rate.
这一天是春运返乡高峰的最后一天，也是航空公司客流骤降的起点——往年的返工、返校潮不复存在，多数人选择延长假期，停止流动。
It was the last day of the spring rush home and the start of a sharp drop in airline traffic, with most people opting to extend their vacations and stop moving when the usual rework and back-to-school craze no longer exists.
赵倩所在的航空公司是国内四大航之一，她的职务是洲际航线客舱经理，国际国内线都飞。
Zhao Qian's airline is one of the four major domestic airlines, her position is intercontinental flight cabin manager, both domestic and international flights.
三十儿过后，公司航班大量取消，空乘人员被通知停薪休假。
Thirty days later, the company's flights were cancelled and the flight attendants were given leave without pay.
如今正月已经过完，她也没有机会再次穿上制服，走进客舱。
Now that January was over, she had no opportunity to put on her uniform again and go into the cabin.
“上一次停薪是2008年了。
"The last time I wasn't paid was in 2008.
”赵倩回忆。
Zhao Qian recalls.
2008金融危机那年民航业受到重创，公司采取的做法就是停薪休假，她当时加入公司没多久，“被轮休”了一个月。
The airline industry was hit hard in the year of the 2008 financial crisis, and the company took unpaid leave after a month of "rotation" within a short time of joining the company.
2020年，赵倩已经由新人变成“老人”，面对此次疫情冲击，公司复制了当年的措施，“看到航班骤减，我就有心理准备了”。
In 2020, Zhao Qian has been transformed from a newcomer to an "old man." Facing the impact of the epidemic, the company replicated the measures of the year by saying, "I am mentally prepared to see the flight drop."
每年的春运和暑运是民航业客运的两大高峰时段。
Spring transport and summer transport are the two peak periods for passenger transport in civil aviation.
而今年，赵倩经历了这些年来最“悠闲”的一个春节。
This year, Zhao Qian has experienced one of the most leisurely Spring Festival in years.
跟很多“受不了突然这么闲”的空乘人员一样，赵倩也报名了公司的抓飞任务。
Like many flight attendants who can't stand the sudden idleness, Zhao Qian has signed up for the company's catch-and-fly mission.
“飞行计划一般都是提前一周以上发布在公司内网上，不会随机出计划，抓飞是指特殊情况下配合临时飞行任务，疫情期间，随时听从公司调度。
"Flight plans are usually posted on the company's intranet more than a week in advance and are not randomly planned," he said.
”但抓飞，也没有轮上她。
"But it wasn't her turn to fly.
空乘人员的收入由底薪和小时费两部分组成，停薪意味着停止发放底薪，在航班数量骤减、无法保证飞行的情况下，小时费也几乎为零，这意味着他们将颗粒无收。
A flight attendant's income consists of a base salary and an hourly fee, which means that the base salary is stopped and the hourly rate is almost zero in the event that the number of flights drops sharply and there is no guarantee that they will fly, which means that they will lose out.
据赵倩了解，除了空乘人员，现在公司各个岗位都实施轮休，轮休期间都处于无薪状态。
According to Zhao Qian, apart from the flight attendants, all positions in the company are now on rotation leave, which is unpaid.
尚无裁员情况出现，但公司今年的新人引进计划已经叫停。
There have been no layoffs, but the company's plan to bring in new hires this year has stalled.
在这场疫情中，这是一个两难的道德选择: 公司层面的“自救”，有时候是以员工的“自我牺牲”为代价的，降薪裁员所影响的个人命运，被裹挟在大批企业为度过疫情的降本节流举措之中。
In this epidemic, it is a moral dilemma: "self-help" at the corporate level, sometimes at the expense of employees "" self-sacrifice, "and the fate of individuals affected by wage reductions and layoffs is being held hostage to cost-cutting efforts by large numbers of businesses to survive the epidemic.
在民航业，航油成本在所有成本结构中占比最高，一般为30%左右，其次就是员工薪酬，接近20%。
In civil aviation, aviation fuel costs account for the highest share of all cost structures, typically around 30 per cent, followed by employee compensation at close to 20 per cent.
如果航班锐减，航油成本也随之降低，但员工薪酬却是一笔固定支出，所以对于航空公司来说，停薪无疑是最直接有效的缩减开支的手段。
For airlines, the absence of pay is the most immediate and effective way to cut costs, given that jet fuel costs are reduced and employee compensation is a fixed cost.
东方航空、吉祥航空成本结构当然，采取停薪这种极端措施的航司在业内并不多。
China Eastern Airlines, lucky aviation cost structure of course, the adoption of no-pay this extreme measures in the shipping industry is not much.
“据我了解，各家应对主要集中在削减预算和延期支付账款两方面，比如跟中航油结算的油费、跟机场计算的起降费等，另外就是尽量保留一些能撑着飞的航班。
"My understanding is that the main focus has been on budget cuts and deferred payments, such as the cost of fuel settled with CNAC, landing and landing fees with airports, and trying to keep flights afloat.
”一家小型航司的市场部工作人员刘威告诉“商业人物”。
Liu Wei, a marketing staff member for a small airline company, told People in Business.
餐饮、旅游行业遭遇的现金流危机，民航行业也无可避免。
Catering, tourism industry encountered cash flow crisis, civil aviation industry is inevitable.
民航局公布的数据显示，受疫情影响，1月25日-2月14日民航日均运输旅客47万人次，只有去年同期的四分之一；另一方面，截至2月15日，国内外航空公司共办理免费退票2000万张，涉及票面总金额超过200亿元——这意味着，航空公司的池子里一面是如涓涓细流的现金流入，一面是大量的资金吐出。
According to figures released by the Civil Aviation Administration, between January 25 and February 14, an average of 470,000 passengers were transported on Civil Aviation Day, a quarter of the same period last year. On the other hand, as of February 15, domestic and foreign airlines had handled 20 million free refunds, involving a total ticket value of over 20 billion yuan.
客运票务收入是航空公司最主要的收入来源，占总营收比例在95%左右。
Passenger ticket revenue is the most important source of revenue for airlines, accounting for about 95% of total revenue.
刘威说，公司春运收入是平常的3-4倍，航空公司依赖每年的春运和暑运盈利，这两个时段挣的钱要用来弥补淡季时的亏损，春运废了，全年的经营状况可以说已经决定了一半。
The airline relies on annual spring and summer revenues to cover losses during the slow season, said Mr. Liu. 'Chunyun is half-way through the year.
各家航司们除了眼睁睁看着“煮熟的鸭子飞了”，还有日常开支要应付。
As well as watching the "cooked ducks fly," the airline companies had to cope with running costs.
刘威算了一笔账：机队规模在20架左右的小型航空公司，每日的成本支出保守估计在600万上下。
Mr Liu reckons that small airlines, with a fleet of around 20, are spending a conservative estimated $6m a day.
按照目前的航班执行情况，取消的航班在半数以上，执飞航班客座率在50%以下，公司每日的收入估计不足200万。
According to current flight performance, more than half of the flights cancelled, less than 50 per cent of the flights were flown, and the company's daily revenue was estimated at less than 2 million.
“有些中小航司现金流本来就吃紧，大幅退票对它们的打击必然是致命的。
"Some small and medium-sized aircraft cash flow is already tight, a large refund to their blow is bound to be fatal.
”此前深陷现金流断裂风波的海航在此次疫情中更是雪上加霜。
Sea Airways, which has been battered by cash-flow disruptions, is making the situation worse.
援引经济观察网一篇报道中海航某位前高管的话，“最近一段时间受疫情冲击，海航有一天的收入只有4000万元。
As one former CAR executive put it in an Economic Watch report, "In the recent past, HNA was hit by an epidemic that one day brought in only $40 million.
而在过去，海航旗下最小的西部航空每天收入也有5000万”“航油欠款近百亿，无力更新航材，已经到了靠拆部分飞机的零部件补充航材的地步。
In the past, Air West, the smallest airline in the world, made $50m a day. "Aviation has nearly 10 billion dollars in arrears and is unable to upgrade its fleet to the point where it needs to replace some of its aircraft parts.
”2月，海航先是旗下香港航空宣布裁员，接着又传出将被其他三大航重组的消息，有网友发出灵魂拷问：海航旗下那么多空姐可怎么办呐。
In February, Air China's Hong Kong Airlines announced layoffs, followed by news that it would be restructured by three other airlines, with netizens asking: What about all the stewardesses under the banner of HNA?
贰与“节流”同时进行的，是各家航司的“开源”自救。
Second, with the "throttling" at the same time, is the navigation department's "open source" self-help.
2月16日，浙江省一则复工消息被大量报道：一架搭载着154名返岗员工的包机，从四川广元机场抵达杭州萧山机场，费用由当地政府和企业共同承担。
A charter flight carrying 154 returning staff arrived at Xiaoshan Airport in Hangzhou from Guangyuan Airport on Feb. 16, at a cost shared by the local government and enterprises.
包机企业位于浙江省，是复工需求最强的地区，而执行此次任务的航班是长龙航空，总部位于浙江省萧山市。
The charter company is based in Zhejiang Province, where demand is strongest, while Changlong Airlines, headquartered in Xiaoshan City, Zhejiang Province, is on the mission.
双方一拍即合。
Both parties clapped.
据长龙航空相关人士介绍，情人节那天，公司接到客户方面的包机需求，经过评估后决定接下来，并用两天时间做好安排。
On Valentine's Day, the company received demand for charter flights from customers, and after evaluation, decided to make the arrangements for the next two days, according to people involved in Long Long Airlines.
实际上，各航空公司一直有包机服务，但将这个用于企业员工返岗，长龙航空是最早的。
In fact, airlines have always had charter services, but this will be used for the return of employees, Changlong Airlines is the earliest.
各大航司很快开始“抄作业”。
The major airlines soon began "copy operations."
截至目前，东航、南航、海航、联航、山东航空等十几家航司纷纷推出此项业务，一向以“高大上”形象示人的航司们甚至来不及精心设计，简单粗暴列出联系人手机号、画风简陋的海报就这样着急登场了。
Up to now, more than a dozen airlines, including China Eastern, China Airlines, Air China, United Airlines and Shandong Airlines, have launched the business. The airline companies, which have always presented themselves as "tall and tall," have not even had time to elaborate.
“包机的上座率能达到9成，相比目前5成左右的上座率来说，还是比较划算的。
"The charter flight has a seating capacity of 90 percent, which is still a good deal compared with the current attendance rate of about 50 percent.
”一家航司的包机对接人王波告诉“商业人物”，目前已经做了6、7单，还有十来单正在协商，有些地方公司没有开航线，还需要一定时间对接。
A charter flight for the airline told Wang Bo, the operator, that 6,7 had already been done and a dozen more were under negotiation. Some local companies were not flying and needed time to dock.
王波表示，公司是在以接近成本价来做这个业务，在疫情期间只要飞机能起飞，就意味着有收入进账，而且这类款项结算周期比较短，现金流能够及时得到补充。
Wang said the company was doing the business at close to cost, that as long as the aircraft could take off during the outbreak, it would mean revenue receipts, and that there would be a short settlement cycle for such payments and timely replenishment of cash flows.
除了包机，大数据成为航空公司恢复其他航线的依据。
In addition to charter flights, big data form the basis for airlines to resume other routes.
“利用我们自己公司的数据，以及第三方OTA平台的热门搜索，可以了解在某一时段某地的集中返程需求。
"Using our own company data, as well as popular searches on third-party OTA platforms, you can understand the need for a focused round-trip somewhere at a time.
今年没有以往初七初八、正月十五这种超高峰，现在所谓的高峰也都比较分散，例如目前大数据显示，西南、西北和河南等地都出现了比较集中的前往华东的需求，我们已经逐步恢复部分航线，上座率可以达到六成。
At present, big data show that there is a more concentrated demand for travel to eastern China in the southwest, northwest and Henan. We have gradually restored some routes, and the attendance rate can reach 60%.
”王波说，除了返工，下一阶段的高峰是返校，要等各地公布的返校时间了。
"In addition to rework, the next phase will culminate in going back to school, pending the release of local returns," Wang said.
春运航线之外，往返于北上广深等一线城市之间的商务线一直是航空公司的“香饽饽”——上座率高且基本是全价票，在此次疫情中“断粮”许久，如今也逐渐开闸。
Outside the Spring Passage route, the business line between first-tier cities such as northbound travel to and from Guangzhou and Shenzhen has always been a hot spot for airlines - high-occupancy, mostly full-price tickets that have been "off food" for a long time, and are now opening up gradually.
以北京-上海线为例，作为国内最繁忙的客运航线，以往一天之内有60次航班，其频率堪比天津往返北京的高铁，两趟航班之间一般间隔30分钟，最短间隔是10分钟。
Take the Beijing-Shanghai line, the busiest passenger route in the country, with 60 flights in the past day, the frequency of which is comparable to that of the high-speed rail link between Tianjin and Beijing.
但是因为疫情影响，在某订票平台上可以看到，2月19日这天只剩6个班次，这距离2月10日两地复工已经过去近10天。
However, owing to the impact of the outbreak, only six flights remained on a booking platform on 19 February, almost 10 days after the resumption of work on 10 February.
25日，京沪航线已经增加到13个航班，但票价依旧低得离谱，最低300元，低至1.8折，最高的也只有540元，跟往日不可同日而语，但对于航空公司来说，市场需求在逐渐恢复，苍蝇再小也是肉。
On May 25, the Beijing-Shanghai route has increased to 13 flights, but ticket prices are still ridiculously low, ranging from a low of 300 yuan to a low of 1.8 percent and a high of only 540 yuan.
各航司创收的方法还包括：厦门航空搞起了副业，在公众号上卖力宣传起自己旗下的生鲜电商、酒店订餐等业务；四川航空除了开始外送火锅，还推出了无门槛优惠券，19.9元购得国内100元机票券，相当于向乘客预支一笔钱救急。
Other methods used by the departments to generate revenue include: Xiamen Airlines has set up a sideline to promote its own live TV business and hotel order on public signs; Sichuan Airlines has introduced no-threshold coupons in addition to delivering hot pot, 19.9 yuan to purchase domestic 100 yuan ticket, equivalent to an advance to passengers to save emergency.
除了自己“造血”，外部“输血”来得更快。
In addition to their own "hematopoiesis," external "blood transfusion" faster.
在上海清算所的网站可以查到，从2月6日开始，两大国有航司——东方航空共募集超短期融资券5期，南方航空6期，分别合计募集资金110亿元和80亿元；此外，厦门航空、四川航空、深圳航空等地方航司也数次通过此种途径补充现金流，单次金额在3亿-10亿不等。
Since February 6, two major countries have raised 11 billion yuan and 8 billion yuan, respectively, through five issues of ultra-short-term securities raised by China Eastern Airlines and eight billion yuan raised by China Eastern Airlines.
在这场疫情中，有一个现象值得关注。
There is one phenomenon that deserves attention in this epidemic.
一位民航圈博主发现，在2月23日这天，从深圳机场出港的航班，顺丰航空数量最多，有33个班次。
On February 23, a blogger in civil aviation discovered that Shunfeng had the largest number of flights out of Shenzhen airport, with 33 flights.
经查询发现，成立于2009年的顺丰航空，这些年来已经先后买下58架飞机，超过中邮航空成为国内最大的货运航空公司了。
Upon enquiry, Shunfeng Airlines, founded in 2009, has bought 58 aircraft over the years, surpassing Air China as the largest cargo carrier in the country.
有网友给出了个主意：顺丰可以发展客运了，主攻廉航不错。
Some netizens gave an idea: Shunfeng can develop passenger transport, the main attack low-air good.
