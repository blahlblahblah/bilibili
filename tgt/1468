燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 苏琦编辑 | 周昶帆今年的疫情来得十分突然，却将包括石墨文档在内的远程办公行业向前推进了一大步。
NEW YORK (Reuters) - This year's outbreak came as a surprise to the former creator of Fun Finance (ID: Rancaijing), but took the telecommuting industry, including graphite files, a big step forward.
很多人不知道的是，石墨文档是一家在武汉成立，直到现在仍有一半员工驻扎在武汉的创业公司。
What many do not know is that the graphite file is a Wuhan-based start-up company that still employs half of its employees.
新冠肺炎疫情发生之后，石墨文档有接近50人留在武汉，他们主要是产品研发、客服、财务和HR部门。
After the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, nearly 50 people in the graphite file remained in Wuhan, mainly in product development, customer service, finance and HR departments.
整个春节期间，他们一边在家隔离，一边为激增的线上办公人群提供服务。
They spent the Spring Festival secluded at home serving the booming online office crowd.
同时，疫情期间，一篇名为《接力编辑 关注病毒的传言与可靠信息》的文档在朋友圈刷了屏，这背后正是石墨文档在为不少志愿者团队提供技术和产品支持。
Meanwhile, during the outbreak, a document called "Rumours and Credible Information of Relay Editors Concerned about Viruses" painted a screen in a circle of friends, behind which graphite files provided technical and product support to volunteer teams.
2月13日，燃财经举办“穿越疫情，企业服务创业者该怎么做？”线上沙龙，在线上沙龙的分享环节，金沙江创投主管合伙人朱啸虎、石墨文档创始人兼CEO吴冰、小鱼易连联合创始人兼CEO袁文辉在社群里进行了主题分享，聊了聊他们对于企业服务行业和疫情应对的看法。
At the online salon, Jinsha founder and managing partner of Jinsha River, founder and CEO of Graphite Document Wu Bing, co-founder and CEO of Fisher-Yi Company, Yuan Wenhui shared their views on the business services industry and the response to the epidemic.
在吴冰看来，这段时间用户都在了解远程办公，这是一个非常好的获客节点，但随着用户量激增，这类产品也面临产品服务稳定性的挑战。
In Wu's view, users are learning about telecommuting during this time, which is a very good customer node, but these products also face the challenge of product and service stability as the number of users surges.
同时，有人担心复工之后一切又回到原点，吴冰称，即使疫情过去，可能一切会回到原点，但只要把产品做好，把该做的事情做好，最终用户还是会留下来。
At the same time, there were fears that everything would return to square one after the resumption of work, and that even if the epidemic was over, everything might return to square one, but the end-user would stay once the product was done and the right thing to do was done.
以下是吴冰的分享，经燃财经整理：半数团队被困武汉一边隔离、一边加班开发新版本疫情发生后，武汉封城，石墨文档有接近50人被“困”在武汉，有部分武汉的小伙伴留在北京和上海，无法回家过年。
Wuhan closed the city with nearly 50 graphite files trapped inside the city, and some of Wuhan's friends stayed in Beijing and Shanghai for the Lunar New Year holiday.
钟南山院士在1月20日确认了新冠肺炎存在人传人的现象，但1月21号、22号的时候，还有很多人去往武汉。
Academician Zhong Nan Shan confirmed human-to-human transmission of pneumonia on January 20, but many others went to Wuhan on January 21 and 22.
吴冰发现，根据志愿者在石墨文档里整合的信息，以及在武汉本地亲朋好友处得到的信息，情况比想象的要紧急很多，他取消了回武汉的航班。
Wu found that according to the information the volunteers had integrated into their graphite files and from relatives and friends in Wuhan, the situation was much more urgent than expected and he cancelled his flight back to Wuhan.
紧接着23号武汉发布封城消息，气氛也开始变得紧张起来。
Immediately after 23 Wuhan issued the news, the atmosphere also began to become tense.
为了让同事们不要太惊慌，石墨文档的人力资源部很快拉起了一个群，挨个关心所有人的健康状况，并且告诉大家一定不要随便走动，做好居家隔离。
To keep colleagues from getting too alarmed, the graphite file's human resources department quickly gathered a group to take care of everyone's health and told everyone not to walk around and keep their homes isolated.
所幸，石墨文档所有员工都没有出现感染症状，只有个别员工的家庭成员不幸被感染。
Fortunately, none of the graphite file employees showed signs of infection, and only the family members of individual employees were unfortunately infected.
留在武汉的大部分员工属于研发和客服部门，他们都是远程办公。
Most of the employees who remain in Wuhan belong to R & D and customer service departments. They are telecommuting.
北京、上海办公室也是在有意识地自我隔离，在家办公。
The Beijing and Shanghai offices are also consciously isolating themselves and working from home.
“这个月是绝对不可能让大家去办公室上班了，等下个月再看。
"It's absolutely out of the question this month for everyone to go to the office and wait till next month.
”吴冰不太放心大家，每天都在钉钉监督大家上传自己的健康信息。
Wu didn't trust everyone enough to upload their own health information every day.
初一初二这两天，针对爆发的线上办公需求，石墨文档开发出了远程办公版，与疫情救助相关的组织可以申请免费使用企业高级版，该版本正常收费是每年每人600元。
For the first two days of the first two days, graphite files for the outbreak of online office needs, the graphite file developed a telecommuting version, related to the epidemic relief organizations can apply for free use of the enterprise advanced version, which is the normal fee of 600 yuan per person per year.
为了上线新的版本，部分项目组40多人都要共同行动，团队一边在家自我隔离，一边加班。
To get the new version online, more than 40 people on some of the project teams have to work together, isolating themselves at home and working overtime.
疫情期间石墨文档远程协助志愿者团队1月22号，一篇名为《接力编辑 关注病毒的传言与可靠信息》的石墨文档在朋友圈开始流传。
A team of volunteers remotely assisted with graphite files during the outbreak began circulating in a circle of friends on January 22, a graphite file called "Rumours and Reliable Information about the Virus Relay Editor."
石墨文档团队发现，志愿者团队使用的是免费版，一旦公开使用权限，任何人都可以进行删减和修改，十分不安全。
The graphite documentation team found that the volunteer team was using a free version, which anyone could delete or modify once public access was granted, making it very unsafe.
而且这一版本受限于人数和功能，在多人数协作上有一些不便之处。
And this version is limited by numbers and functionality, and there are some inconveniences about multi-person collaboration.
随后团队主动联系了这支志愿者团队，开放了高级版，并在后方紧急协助。
The team then reached out to the volunteer team, opened up the advanced version, and assisted with emergency assistance from the rear.
和阳就是石墨负责协助的成员之一，在接下来的十多天里，他接触了超过10支公益团队，随着各团队加入的成员越来越多，客户的需求也是越来越多。
He was one of the graphite-assisted members, and over the next decade or so he contacted more than 10 pro bono teams, which grew in number as the teams joined the group.
当时石墨文档的个人免费版只能供15个人协作，远远达不到使用的需求，而企业高级版虽在支持人数上能够达标，一些功能却需要和阳远程指导各组织使用。
The free personal version of the graphite file was available to only 15 people, far short of what was needed, while the high-level version of the enterprise was up to par in terms of number of support staff, while some features required remote guidance from Heyang to the organizations.
那段时间，他每天早上7:30就得起床，晚上大概12:30睡，基本时刻都需在线，目的是让世界各地的华人在各个公益组织中通过石墨流畅、不停地更新着最新信息。
At that time, he had to get up at 7: 30 in the morning and sleep around 12: 30 at night. He needed to be on-line at all basic times, so that Chinese around the world could keep up-to-date with graphite flow and updates in various public interest organizations.
他告诉燃财经，疫情信息公布主要体现的就是实时性、及时性。
He told Flaming Finance that the disclosure of epidemic information mainly reflects the real-time, timely.
除夕夜那天，家里还放着春节联欢晚会，他突然接到nCoV-支援团队（现‘卓明’团队）的紧急需求，随即语音予以指导，跑通了组织内部流程。
On New Year's Eve, with the Spring Festival Gala still on at home, he suddenly received an urgent request from the nCoV-Support Team (now the Chuang Ming team), then spoke up and ran through the organization's internal processes.
当时他感受了这一次疫情防御战确实是要分秒必争。
He felt at the time that the battle against the epidemic was a race against the clock.
慢慢地，和阳发现了一个很浪费资源的问题——好多团队在做重复的无用功。
Slowly, Heyang discovered a waste of resources - many teams are doing repetitive, unproductive work.
因为大家搜集信息的源头都是一样的，基本80%的信息都一样，他干脆拉了一个群，把近12支使用石墨的公益组织团队创始人或负责人拉在一起，说明情况，看是否能产生一些化学反应。
Because the source of all the information was the same, basically 80% of the information was the same, he simply pulled a group together and pulled together the founders or leaders of nearly a dozen pro bono groups that used graphite to explain whether there were chemical reactions.
“没想到还真有四五个团队各抒所长，以阿夏桑为代表的文字组（她联系了几个专业编辑和果壳内容部的编辑），以及A2N、Simo等团队的文字组对信息进行筛选整合，在石墨技术的协助下，打通自动化信息流程渠道，提取到wuhan2020团队的项目上做实时更新，对外展示。
"I didn't expect four or five teams to say their stuff, with Ashasam as the representative of the text group (she contacted several professional editors and fruit shell content group), and A2N, Simo and other teams to screen and integrate the information, with the assistance of graphite technology, open automated information flow channels and extract real-time updates on the Wuhan 2020 team's projects.
”和阳补充道，“同时我也很感激他们，没有他们对石墨文档的信任，我也不可能有这个机会去接触、融入大家。
"I'm also grateful to them," he added. "Without their trust in graphite documents, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet and be part of everyone.
石墨文档能够作为一个载体把疫情信息快、准、狠地传递给有需要的人，我真的很骄傲。
I'm really proud that graphite files can be used as a vector to deliver epidemic information to people in need quickly, accurately and cruelly.
”远程办公需求激增创业者应理性面对受疫情影响，线上办公这样的需求因为推迟复工开始爆发，全国范围内的各个企业和机构都开始去关注线上的工作方式。
Telecommuting needs surge Founders should face the epidemic rationally as demand for online work starts to explode as businesses and organizations across the country focus on online ways of working.
App Store中，钉钉、企业微信等线上办公APP，排名都有所提升，下载量也都有比较大的增长。
App Store, nail, enterprise micro-letter and other online office APP, ranking has been improved, download volume has also been relatively large growth.
一般来讲，App Store的免费榜前五或者前十，很少会出现办公类软件。
In general, the App Store's top five or top ten free lists rarely include office-like software.
然而这段时间，远程办公APP、在线教育APP开始占据前二十的大部分名额。
In the meantime, however, telecommuting APPs and online education APPs are beginning to occupy the majority of the top 20 places.
一提起远程办公，大部分人首先想到的就是语音视频会议，钉钉、企业微信、QQ这些代表性产品。
When it comes to telecommuting, most people first think of voicemail, nailing, corporate micro-mail, QQ these representative products.
其实除了这些产品以外，远程办公软件还有Teambition、Trello、Worktile等任务管理软件；Zoom、小鱼易连等视频会议软件；百度网盘、坚果云、亿方云这一类云盘应用；以及石墨文档、WPS、腾讯文档等文档协作软件。
In addition to these products, there are mission management software such as Teambion, Trello and Worktile; videoconferencing software such as Zoom, Trello, LinkedIn; cloud applications such as dot-com, nutty clouds and Million Cloud; and collaboration software for documents such as graphite files, WPS, Tencent files, etc.
疫情期间，远程办公软件数据涨幅最大的一类就是语音视频会议。
During the epidemic, tele-office software data rose the largest category is voice videoconferencing.
据业内人士称，Zoom在年前平均每天的下载量可能4000都不到，现在有5万甚至更多；钉钉平时是8万多，现在基本上每天有40到50多万的下载量。
Zoom may have downloaded less than 4,000 downloads a day before, but now it has 50,000 or more; nails are more than 80,000, and there are now roughly 400,000 to 500,000 downloads a day, according to people in the industry.
这还只是苹果App Store的数据。
That's just Apple App Store data.
石墨文档在最近这段时间的新增用户量和企业注册数也有大幅增长，吴冰称最少在五倍以上。
Graphite files in the recent period of new users and business registrations have also increased significantly, Wu said at least five times.
2月3日，众多企业员工远程上班的第一天，钉钉、企业微信等产品的语音视频会议板块都出现了崩溃而无法提供服务的情况。
On Feb. 3, on the first day of telecommuting, voice-over-the-phone sessions for nail tacks and micromail failed to deliver services.
一方面可以看出用户需求量之大，另一方面也反映了对于线上办公产品来说，稳定性尤为重要。
On the one hand can see the user demand big, on the other hand also reflects to the online office product, the stability is particularly important.
虽然石墨文档新增用户上涨比较明显，但从活跃度和销售承接来讲，面对突如其来的流量，仍然会滞后很多。
Although the increase in graphite file users more obvious, but from the activity and sales commitments, in the face of sudden flow, will still lag a lot.
短期看，石墨为代表的远程办公软件在销售上仍然会受到很大影响。
In the short term, graphite-represented telecommuting software will continue to be a big influence on sales.
一方面很多企业仍然没有真正回到办公室上班，所以企业主做购买决策也会往后推迟。
On the one hand, many businesses still don't really return to the office, so business owners can postpone purchasing decisions.
另外，基本上在疫情期间，所有远程办公工具都提供了免费使用的优惠，而在这种策略下，销售就会面对一定阻力。
Also, basically during the epidemic, all telecommuting tools offer a free-of-charge discount, and under this strategy, sales face some resistance.
对于远程办公软件来说，这一段时间是个非常好的契机，让用户去了解和使用。
For telecommuting software, this period is a very good opportunity for users to understand and use.
用户激增也给团队带来了挑战，产品研发团队、市场团队，包括销售和客服团队都会异常忙碌，而要紧急增加人手对整个组织和招聘工作来说也是一个挑战。
The proliferation of users also presents a challenge to the team, with product development teams, marketing teams, including sales and customer service teams, being extremely busy, and the urgent need for additional staffing is a challenge for the entire organization and the recruitment process.
在这样一个窗口期，企业服务公司应该深入理解用户的需求和实际情况，不能太盲目地去随大流，比如说做推广、投放、营销等等，结果会浪费很多资源。
In such a window, corporate service companies should have a deep understanding of users' needs and realities, and should not blindly follow the crowd, such as doing promotions, launches, marketing, etc., with the result that many resources will be wasted.
企业更应切合用户的需求，如果一味只增加曝光、拉新，实际需求没有很好地得到解决，在风口之下，资金投放的利用率就会非常低，浪费很多机会，用户留存也会非常困难。
Enterprises should be more in line with the needs of users, if blindly only to increase exposure, pull new, the actual demand is not well addressed, under the wind tunnel, the utilization of funds will be very low, many opportunities will be wasted, and user retention will be very difficult.
对话吴冰燃财经：疫情对石墨文档的现金流考验大吗，怎么对冲这种影响？吴冰：我们的现金储备比较充足。
Dialogue Script2 2 Wu Bingfang Finance: Is the cash flow of graphite documents tested by the epidemic? How can we hedge this impact? Wu Bing: We have sufficient cash reserves.
这一次疫情引发了大家对远程办公极高的关注，对整个线上办公行业都是一个利好消息。
This outbreak has sparked a great deal of concern about telecommuting, which is good news for the entire online office industry.
在这种情况下，石墨文档的新增用户也有非常大的增长，我们也会抓住机会快速往前推进业务，获取更多客户，这也有利于后期的融资。
In this case, there is also a very large increase in the number of new users of graphite documents, and we will seize the opportunity to move forward quickly to acquire more customers, which will also facilitate late-stage financing.
燃财经：用户都希望免费使用远程办公软件，长期来看，是否会对商业化造成较大的不利影响？石墨文档有何商业化策略？吴冰：为了帮助各企业渡过难关，很多远程办公厂商都提出了不同的免费策略。
Flaming Finance: Do users want to use telecommuting software for free, will it have a significant negative impact on commercialization in the long run? Wu Bing: Many telecommuters have come up with different free strategies to help companies tide over difficulties.
这期间用户都在了解远程办公，是非常好的获客节点，短期内不一定会带来直接收入，但能推动客户的使用，即使他的付费时间点会往后移，对长线的商业化收入也是非常大的利好。
During this period, the user is aware of telecommuting, is a very good customer node, may not bring direct income in the short term, but can promote the use of customers, even if his payment point will move backward, the long-term commercial revenue is also very good.
我们也在增加销售团队和服务团队，对于新增的小白用户予以更好的服务，让大家能够真正认识到这些产品该如何使用，带来长期的价值。
We are also adding sales teams and service teams to provide better service to new white users, so that people can really understand how these products should be used, to bring long-term value.
燃财经：大厂免费开放同类产品，长期下去你会担心自身的市场被挤压吗？你的竞争策略是什么？吴冰：资金实力比较雄厚的大厂，会免费开放一些同类产品，但在产品的体验、功能、性能上，各家还有优化的空间。
What is your competitive strategyWu Bing: Large factories with strong capital will open up some similar products free of charge, but there is still room for improvement in product experience, function and performance.
大厂的免费策略对我们不可能完全没有影响，我们的策略是，提供更强的体验、功能和性能，在意的用户会愿意买单。
Our strategy is to provide greater experience, functionality, and performance, and the customers we care about are willing to pay for it.
就好比Zoom和一些大厂都在做远程会议产品，很多用户为了体验更好的稳定性，还是愿意花钱去用Zoom，它的收费点在于产品的强项和特色。
Just as Zoom and some big companies are doing teleconferencing products, many users are willing to pay for Zoom for better stability.
燃财经：你认为产品体验是石墨的杀手锏？你为什么这么“痴迷”产品的细节？吴冰：石墨文档非常重视企业管理的功能，企业的需求非常复杂，我们做了很多种高级权限的设定。
Why are you so obsessed with the details of the productWu Bing: The graphite documents attach great importance to the function of enterprise management, the needs of enterprises are very complicated, we have done a lot of high-level permission setting.
我们还在企业版用户的体验、功能和性能上，和免费版做了非常大的区隔，比如说表格：跨表引用，透视表，图表功能，筛选视图等。
We also make a very big distinction between the experience, functionality and performance of Enterprise Edition users and the free version, such as tables: cross-table references, PivotTable, Chart features, Filter views, etc.
另外，视觉、产品设计等是一个办公产品很重要的部分，这也是从创立之初就开始关注的。
In addition, vision, product design and so on is a very important part of the office products, this is also from the beginning of the attention.
燃财经：站在远程办公的风口上，眼下最重要的、最需要做好的事情是什么？吴冰：站在远程办公的风口之上，我们作为在线文档的创业公司，最重要的是能够契合大家关注的时间点，把产品最好的功能和体验提供给用户，然后让用户能够真正享受到好产品的价值。
What is the most important and important thing to do right now when standing on the trough of telecommuting? Wu Bing: Standing on the trough of telecommuting, we, as a start-up company for online documents, are able to fit in with everyone's concerns, provide users with the best features and experiences, and then really enjoy the value of good products.
我们要真正去理解用户的需求并且把握住这样的需求，把产品做到更好、更高的位置。
We need to truly understand the needs of users and grasp such needs, to make the product better, higher position.
在风口之下保持冷静，保持对行业的洞见，清晰理智地往这个方向去努力，这个是最重要的。
It is most important to remain calm under the tuyere, to maintain insight into the industry, and to work clearly and rationally in this direction.
燃财经：有人担心复工之后一切又回到原点，你担心这个问题吗？为什么？吴冰：创业这么几年，对这个问题我实际上是不担心的。
Are you worried about that? Why? Wu Bing: After all these years of starting a business, I really don't worry about it.
我认为风口是一次机会，但这些机会都是暂时的，一切都可能会回到原点。
I think the tuyere is an opportunity, but these opportunities are temporary and everything may come back to where it started.
当一切都回到原点时，我们只要把我们的产品做好，把我们该做的事情做好就行了。
When we get back to where we started, we just have to do our products right and do what we have to do.
利用好这次契机，去跟更多有远程办公需求的用户进行对话，有更多的曝光，服务更多的客户。
Take advantage of this opportunity to talk to more users with telecommuting needs, have more exposure, and serve more customers.
获得的新增用户经过这段时间的蓄力，会有一个持续的积累过程，最终都会留下来。
The acquisition of additional users over this period of time, there will be a continuous accumulation process, eventually will stay.
燃财经：很多用户体验好的工具类软件在变现时都会遇到难题，你有什么判断和认知？吴冰：在中国，工具类软件在很长一段时间都面临着变现难的问题，这也是整个SaaS行业面临的难题。
What are your judgments and cognition? Wu Bing: In China, tooling software has been facing the problem of liquidating for a long time, which is a difficult problem for the SaaS industry as a whole.
只是说每年都在变好，特别是这次疫情，让大家开始关心远程办公行业，增长的速度也就更快一些。
It's just that it's getting better every year, especially this one, and it's got people concerned about telecommuting, and it's growing faster.
我们去年的商业化做得还不错，很多用户付费意愿非常强，从2019年、2020年再往后，企业服务的元年已经开始。
We did a good job of commercialization last year, with many users willing to pay very strongly, starting in 2019, 2020 and beyond, the first year of business services.
我们的融资相对比较顺利，商业化表现也吸引了很多投资人的兴趣。
Our financing has been relatively smooth and our commercial performance has attracted a lot of investor interest.
但主要还是要把产品做好、商业化做好，这是最重要的。
But the main thing is to do the product well and commercialize it well, which is the most important thing.
燃财经：石墨最终要成为一家什么样的公司？吴冰：石墨文档有机会成为一家百亿美金的公司，甚至更多，只要能够把线上办公这个部分做好，让大家平时使用的文档、表格、幻灯片都能在云上跑起来，并且能够帮助大家更好地运作业务流程。
What kind of company will graphite eventually become? Wu Bing: Graphite documentation has the opportunity to become a multi-billion dollar company, or even more, as long as you can get the online office part right so that the documents, forms and slides that you normally use can run through the clouds and help people run their business processes better.
以后会有这样的机会。
There will be such an opportunity.
