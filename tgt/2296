然而，最近几天，格鲁吉亚、巴林、伊拉克、科威特、阿曼、阿富汗、巴基斯坦等多个国家都出现了和伊朗相关的确诊病例，新冠肺炎疫情有在整个中东地区蔓延的趋势。
In recent days, however, Iran-related cases have been confirmed in Georgia, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic spreading throughout the Middle East.

关于伊朗的疫情，社交媒体上疑问重重、谣言不断。
With regard to the Iranian epidemic, questions and rumours abound on social media.

━━━━━释疑1：伊朗为何死亡率如此之高？据CNN报道，在通报出现新冠肺炎疫情的所有国家中，伊朗是除中国外死亡病例数最多的国家，也是死亡率最高的国家。
2006-03-13 09: 53: 53 Iran's Death Rate Is Such a High It is the country with the highest number of deaths outside China and the highest death rate of any country that has reported a new crown pneumonia, CNN reported.
韩国确诊病例1766例，死亡病例13例，死亡率大约0.7%。
Korea has 1,766 confirmed cases and 13 deaths, with a mortality rate of about 0.7 per cent.
意大利确诊病例470例，死亡病例12例，死亡率大约2.5%。
There were 470 confirmed cases and 12 deaths in Italy, with a mortality rate of about 2.5 per cent.
日本确诊病例207例（不含“钻石公主”邮轮确诊病例），死亡病例4例，死亡率大约1.9%。
There were 207 confirmed cases in Japan (excluding confirmed cases of Princess Diamond) and 4 deaths, with a mortality rate of about 1.9 per cent.
而伊朗确诊病例245例，死亡病例26例，死亡率大约10.6%。
There were 245 confirmed cases and 26 deaths in Iran, with a mortality rate of about 10.6 per cent.
为何伊朗的新冠肺炎死亡率要远高于其他国家呢？在社交媒体上，一些网友质疑伊朗政府瞒报真实的感染数据。
Why is Iran's death rate from pneumonia much higher than in other countries? On social media, some netizens questioned the Iranian government's concealment of true infection data.
伊朗半官方媒体ILNA此前还曾报道称，伊朗库姆市一位议员指责伊朗卫生部瞒报疫情，称仅在库姆市就有50多人死亡。
Iran's semi-official media ILNA has also previously reported that a lawmaker in Qom accused Iran's health ministry of underreporting the disease, saying more than 50 people died in the city of Qom alone.
但是，伊朗政府官员否认他们瞒报了任何真实情况。
However, Iranian government officials deny that they have misrepresented anything true.
事实上，伊朗26日已下令，要求严惩传播新冠肺炎疫情谣言的人，违者将被判处1-3年监禁并处以鞭刑。
In fact, Iran on the 26th has ordered the severe punishment of those who spread rumors of the outbreak of pneumonia, otherwise they will be sentenced to 1-3 years of imprisonment and flogging.
据美国全国广播公司（NPR）报道，一些专家认为，伊朗的死亡率相对较高，很可能是因为伊朗的病毒检测能力有限，这使得确诊感染数较小。
According to the National Broadcasting Corporation (NPR), some experts believe Iran's relatively high death rate is likely due to Iran's limited ability to detect the virus, which makes the number of confirmed infections small.
美国斯滕山大学全球卫生研究中心主任Yanzhong Huang称，伊朗政府可能并未注意到那些症状相对较轻的病例，这使得确诊数的变化跟不上死亡数的变化。
Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Research at Mount Stern University in the United States, says the Iranian government may not have noticed cases with relatively mild symptoms, making changes in the number of confirmed cases unable to keep pace with changes in the number of deaths.
美国范德堡大学医学中心传染病专家William Schaffner则认为，伊朗可能无法做到找出所有感染新冠病毒的人，因为这需要对所有潜在患者进行病毒检测，他们目前并无这个检测能力。
William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the United States, says Iran may not be able to identify all those infected with the new crown virus because it requires testing for all potential patients, who do not currently have the ability to do so.
此外，Schaffner认为，伊朗报告的确诊患者可能多是相对脆弱的老年患者，这也有可能解释了为何伊朗死亡率相对较高。
Furthermore, according to Schaffner, the number of confirmed patients reported in Iran may be relatively vulnerable elderly patients, which may also explain the relatively high mortality rate in Iran.

━━━━━释疑2：伊朗是否有足够的医疗设备应对疫情？据NPR报道，许多人担忧伊朗的新冠肺炎疫情会导致中东地区疫情大暴发，一个重要的原因是伊朗医疗设备不足，或将难以有效控制疫情。
2006-03-12 10: 23 2008-04-16 09: 23 2008-04-12 21: 23 2008-04-10 09: 08: 40 Iran has enough medical equipment to deal with the outbreak Many fear that Iran's outbreak of the New Crown Pneumonia could lead to a major outbreak in the Middle East, not least because of inadequate medical equipment or difficulties in effectively containing the outbreak, NPR reports.
库姆医科大学校长Mohammad Reza Ghadir此前在接受伊朗国家电视台访问时表示，大部分的新冠病毒检测工作都得在首都德黑兰完成。
Mohammad Reza Ghadir, president of Qom Medical University, told Iranian state television that much of the new crown virus testing would have to be done in Tehran.
事实上，世界卫生组织已经开始向伊朗运送新冠病毒检测试剂盒，同时为伊朗的医护人员提供防护设备。
Indeed, the World Health Organization has begun shipping new crown virus test kits to Iran, while providing protective equipment for Iranian health-care workers.
据BBC报道，伊朗卫生部发言人称，已经四次收到世卫组织送来的相关设备。
According to the BBC, a spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Health said it had received equipment from WHO on four occasions.
鲁哈尼在26日的内阁会议上也证实，伊朗收到了世卫组织运送的医疗设备。
Rouhani also confirmed at the cabinet meeting on the 26th, Iran received WHO shipments of medical equipment.
此外，还有一些国际供应商愿意向伊朗提供检测试剂盒，但是由于美国的制裁，交易存在一定困难。
In addition, a number of international suppliers were willing to provide test kits to Iran, but there were difficulties with the transaction due to United States sanctions.
美国方面则否认对伊朗的制裁影响到伊朗进口医疗设备，称对于人道主义援助物资有豁免。
The United States has denied that sanctions against Iran have affected Iranian imports of medical equipment, saying it has an exemption for humanitarian aid.
在口罩、消毒液等防护物资上，伊朗也面临短缺困局。
Iran also faces shortages of protective materials such as masks and disinfectants.
伊朗政府已下令，三个月内禁止口罩出口，同时要求企业加速生产这些物资。
The Iranian government has ordered a three-month ban on the export of masks and urged companies to speed up production.
据伊朗迈赫尔通讯社报道，伊朗国防部长哈塔米24日下令，要求国防工业组织立即开始生产抗击新冠病毒的消毒液。
Iran's defense minister, Mohammad Khatami, ordered the Defense Industry Organization to immediately begin producing antiseptic solutions to the new cap virus, the Iranian news agency Mehr reported.
军工厂每天需生产2万升消毒液，以满足伊朗公众的需求。
Military plants produce 20,000 litres of disinfectant per day to meet the needs of the Iranian public.
伊朗工业部24日也要求各工厂加速生产口罩等防护设备，所有口罩将由卫生部收购，随后免费发放给公众。
Iran's Ministry of Industry 24 also asked factories to speed up the production of protective equipment such as masks, all of which will be purchased by the Ministry of Health, and then distributed free of charge to the public.
另据新华社报道，中国驻伊朗大使馆25日代表中国政府和当地中资企业向伊朗卫生和医疗教育部捐赠25万只口罩，支持伊朗抗击新冠肺炎疫情。
On behalf of the Chinese government and local Chinese enterprises, the Chinese Embassy in Iran donated 250,000 masks to the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education on Friday to support the country's fight against the outbreak, Xinhua reported.
中国驻伊朗大使常华还对伊方在中国抗击疫情之初向中方提供医疗物资表示了感谢。
China's ambassador to Iran, Changhua, also thanked Iraq for providing medical supplies to China at the beginning of its fight against the epidemic.
━━━━━释疑3：伊朗为何拒绝封闭城镇？在上周疫情开始暴发后，伊朗采取了许多举措试图防控疫情。
2006-03-13 09: 53: 48 Why Iran Rejects Closed TownsAfter last week's outbreak, Iran has taken a number of steps to try to prevent and control the outbreak.
包括要求所有学校关闭一周，疫情发生地取消周五祈祷活动，在国内实施出行限制，设置检查点以筛查潜在病患等。
These include a one-week ban on all schools, the cancellation of Friday prayers in affected areas, restrictions on travel within the country and checkpoints to screen potential patients.
但是，伊朗总统鲁哈尼拒绝封闭任何城镇地区。
But Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, refuses to close any urban areas.
据BBC报道，鲁哈尼周三在一次内阁会议上表示，“我们并无计划隔离任何地区或任何城市。
"We have no plan to isolate any area or city," Rouhani said at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, BBC reported.
我们只隔离个人。
We only isolate individuals.
如果任何人出现了早期症状，这个人必须隔离”。
If anyone has early symptoms, that person must be isolated.
此前，伊朗卫生部副部长确诊感染新冠病毒，目前正处于隔离中。
Earlier, Iran's deputy health minister confirmed the infection with the new crown virus, which is now being quarantined.
27日，伊朗议会国家安全和外交政策委员会主席也确诊感染被隔离。
On 27 July, the Chairman of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian Parliament also confirmed the isolation of the infection.
在伊朗新冠肺炎疫情中，库姆市处于核心位置。
The city of Qom is at the heart of Iran's new crown pneumonia epidemic.
截至26日，在确诊的139例中，有大约一半来自库姆市。
As of 26 June, approximately half of the 139 confirmed cases came from the city of Qom.
库姆市（Qom）位于伊朗西北部，是伊斯兰教什叶派圣地。
Qom is a Shiite holy site in northwestern Iran.
在疫情暴发后，伊朗官员要求民众不要前往该地，但并未关闭城中宗教圣地。
Iranian officials asked people not to go to the area after the outbreak, but did not close religious sites in the city.

其中Hazrat Masumeh神社每年都有上百万来自世界各地的什叶派穆斯林朝圣者前去朝圣。
Of these, the Hazrat Masumeh Shrine brings millions of Shia Muslim pilgrims from around the world to make pilgrimages every year.
负责管理该神社的人称，人们将神社视为恢复和治愈的源泉，因此不能关闭它。
Those who run the shrine say it cannot be shut down because people see it as a source of healing and healing.
事实上，鲁哈尼拒绝封闭城镇有自己的考虑。
Indeed, Rouhani has his own reasons for refusing to close down towns.
据CNN报道，鲁哈尼称，新冠病毒“已经成为敌人手中（对抗伊朗）的武器”，不应该因为此次疫情停止国家工作和生产，从而对伊朗经济造成更严重的影响。
Rouhani said the virus "has become a weapon in the hands of the enemy" and should not be allowed to halt national work and production because of the outbreak, which could have a more severe impact on Iran's economy, according to CNN.
自美国特朗普政府于2018年重启对伊制裁后，伊朗的经济受到极大冲击。
Since the US Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iraq in 2018, Iran's economy has been hit hard.
世卫组织地中海东部区域办公室成员阿布巴卡尔称，伊朗拥有该地区最好的医疗卫生系统之一，有能力应对疫情，但美国的制裁对伊朗经济造成巨大打击，可能导致伊朗应对疫情受到影响。
Abu Bakar, a member of the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, says Iran has one of the best health systems in the region and is capable of dealing with the epidemic, but that U.S. sanctions have dealt a huge blow to the Iranian economy and could affect Iran's response to the epidemic.
鲁哈尼表示，从卫生部的报告来看，伊朗防控疫情“充满希望”。
Rouhani said the report from the Ministry of Health, Iran's control of the epidemic "hopeful."
━━━━━释疑4：中东地区疫情暴发有多危险？随着伊朗疫情快速发酵，中东地区多国开始警惕起来。
Streams in the Middle East How dangerous is the outbreak With the rapid spread of disease in Iran, many countries in the Middle East are on the alert.
据阿拉伯新闻网报道，除伊朗外，巴林、科威特、伊拉克过去几天的新冠病毒感染病例也快速增长。
According to the Arab News Network, Bahrain, Kuwait and Iraq, with the exception of Iran, have also seen rapid increases in new crown virus infections over the past few days.
截至目前，巴林确诊病例33例、科威特确诊43例、伊拉克确诊6例，其中大部分确诊病例都和伊朗有关，一些国家直接指责伊朗依然开放圣城库姆。
To date, 33 cases have been confirmed in Bahrain, 43 in Kuwait and 6 in Iraq, most of which have been confirmed in Iran, and some countries have directly accused Iran of keeping the holy city of Qom open.
除上述几个国家外，阿联酋、阿曼、以色列、黎巴嫩、埃及、格鲁吉亚、阿尔及利亚、巴基斯坦、阿富汗等中东地区国家也都报告了新冠病毒感染病例。
In addition to the above-mentioned countries, countries in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Georgia, Algeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan, have also reported new cases of the virus.
美媒VOX称，中东地区暴发疫情将非常危险。

目前，也门、阿富汗、叙利亚等国家的战争依然未停止，数百万难民逃离家园。
Wars are continuing in Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere, with millions of refugees fleeing their homes.
此外，中东地区大部分都是宗教国家，朝圣者在各国间的流动非常频繁。
Moreover, most of the Middle East is a religious country, with pilgrims moving with great frequency from country to country.
卫生专家称，这使得中东地区成为引发疫情大流行的“最佳地点”。
Health experts say this makes the Middle East the "best place" for a pandemic.
此外，中东多国卫生系统遭破坏，应对疫情能力较低，因此疫情若无法得到控制，将产生非常严重的后果。
In addition, the destruction of multi-country health systems in the Middle East and the low capacity to respond to the epidemic will have very serious consequences if the epidemic is not contained.
