2月15日，武汉下了一场大雪，天气极为寒冷，狂风足以把雨伞掀翻。
On February 15, Wuhan, a heavy snow, the weather is extremely cold, the wind enough to overturn the umbrella.
而街上的行人极少，到了晚间，白雪掩盖了大半个武汉。
The streets and few pedestrians, in the evening, the snow covered most of Wuhan.
这是封城后的第23天，每个人都在等待雪融冰消。
It was the 23rd day after the siege, and everyone was waiting for the snow to melt.
冰雪很快在第二天消失，但春天还没有来。
Snow and ice soon disappeared the next day, but spring had not yet come.
我从武昌区去往青山区，见到的路障比行人还多。
I went from Wuchang District to the Qingshan area and saw more roadblocks than pedestrians.
寒风依然萧瑟，在驾驶到一座长江大桥时，我看见两岸密集的高楼建筑，在雪融后变得明亮刺眼，像是一座钢铁森林。
The wind is still bleak, driving to a bridge in the Yangtze River, I saw the two sides of the dense high-rise buildings, after melting snow become bright and dazzling, like a forest of steel.
武汉更加封闭了。
Wuhan is even more closed.
数日以来，对新冠肺炎病人从提倡居家隔离，变成了“应收尽收”，每个区设立了方舱医院和隔离点，病人们各有各的归属。
Over the past few days, patients with pneumonia have moved from home-based isolation to "take-it-or-leave-it", with cabin hospitals and isolation points in each district, with patients falling into their own right.
而对其他市民，管控也趋于严厉，从禁止驾车，到出入管理，再到彻底封闭社区。
For the rest of the population, controls range from bans on driving, to access control, to the complete closure of communities.
对疫情发起总攻的武汉，仿佛一个大型的军事化管理的校园。
Wuhan, which launched a general attack on the epidemic, looks like a large-scale militarized school.
但是，有的人必须出门。
But some people have to go out.
“急救中心120”承担了一部分运输任务。
First Aid Center 120 undertook part of the transportation task.
我来到青山区的一个急救站，他们已经坚持了一个月的高强度工作。
I came to a first aid station in the Qingshan area. They had been working hard for a month.
在最忙的时候，他们运输发热的疑似病人、确诊病人，以及其他有就医需求的病人。
At peak times, they transport febrile suspected patients, diagnosed patients, and other patients in need of medical attention.
每天出车20多趟，24小时无休息。
More than 20 trips a day, 24 hours without rest.
即便在平时，急救车也是浓缩了“生老病死”的一个场景，疫情时期的它，更是为数不多观察武汉的一个移动窗口。
Even in ordinary times, the ambulance is a scene of "life and death," and it was one of the few mobile windows to observe Wuhan during the epidemic.
通过这扇窗口，能看见特殊时期疫情导致的伤痛，也有反复发生的武汉的日常。
Through this window, you can see the special period of the disease caused by the pain, but also repeated daily Wuhan.
武汉“孤岛”“我来给你介绍一下吧。
Wuhan "Isle Island" "Let me introduce you to you.
”陶玲非常热情地招呼我，她是今天这班的医生。
"Tao Ling greeted me very warmly. She was the doctor of today's class.
医生、护士、司机各1名，加上担架员2名，是急救车上的基本配置。
A doctor, a nurse, a driver and two stretchers are the basic configuration of the ambulance.
她一边把短发利落地扎起，一边对我说：“虽然急救站是开在医院的，但我们人员是归武汉120管……”话没说完，警铃大作，一串尖锐短促的“叮……”，像是上课铃。
As she tied her short hair neatly, she said to me: "Although the emergency station is open in the hospital, but our staff members belong to Wuhan 120 tube..."
它是一个信号：该出车了。
It's a signal: it's time to get out.
其他4个人急忙从宿舍出来，急救站的站长也来到跟前，嘱咐说：“穿好防护服。
The other four people hurried out of the dormitory, the station's stationmaster also came to him, charged: "Wear protective clothing.
”这话是对初来乍到的我说的，他们都已经熟练，动作不紧不慢，却在一分钟内变魔术似的穿好了。
'I said this to the newcomers, who had grown so dexterous and slow that they had put on magically in a minute.
防护服是件通身雪白的连体衣，要拉开上半身的锁链，提着它将双脚放进去，整个过程不能着地，不然会影响效果。
The suit is a snow-white jumpsuit that unlocks the upper part of the body and puts its feet into it. The process cannot touch the ground, otherwise the effect will be affected.
接着，穿好袖子，把锁链合上。
Then put on your sleeve and close the chain.
后来我才知道，这种一身白的防护服，质量不算好，好的防护服是有条纹和胶带的。
Later I learned that this kind of white protective clothing, quality is not good, good protective clothing is striped and tape.
但陶玲他们没有好的，只能用它面对现场的一切可能性。
But Tao Ling they have no good, can only use it to face the scene of all the possibilities.
不过，出这趟车的任务，不是接送病人，而是开一单死亡证明。
However, the mission of the bus was not to transport patients, but to issue a death certificate.
我们来到一家民营的养老院。
We came to a private nursing home.
院长早就等在楼下，见到救护车赶紧招手。
The prioress waited downstairs long before she saw the ambulance beckoning.
陶玲跳下副驾驶，从车里提出行李箱样大的心电仪，快步迈着台阶。
Tao Ling jumped out of the copilot, took a suitcase-sized electrocardiograph from the car, and hurried up the steps.
护士提着另一箱仪器，在后面紧紧跟着。
The nurse followed closely behind her, carrying another case of equipment.
两位女性轻喘着气，但脚步从不放慢。
The two women gasped, but never slowed.
跟平常不同，如今她们有全身防护，挂着口罩、戴着护目镜，喘出的气很快在护目镜上液化，视线变得越来越模糊。
Unlike usual, they now have full body protection, masks and goggles, and their panting breath quickly liquefy on the goggles, blurring their vision.
我们跟着院长到了4楼的养老院，电梯打开是一道阴暗的长廊，彼此就更难看清楚了。
We followed the dean to the nursing home on the fourth floor. The elevator opened into a dark corridor, making it harder to see each other.
去世的老人在左边第二间房，院长说：“他在昨天还好好的，突然就不行了。
The old man was in the second room on the left. The dean said, "He was all right yesterday.
他没有发烧也不咳，不是那个病。
He doesn't have a fever or cough. It's not the disease.
”“那个病”是说新冠肺炎，它现在是武汉人绕不过去的一个词。
"" That disease, "referring to the new crown pneumonia, is now a word Wuhan people can't around the past.
在逝者对面仅1米的床上，躺着一位看上去有功能障碍的老人，他看见房间里全身防护的人，眼睛瞪得很大，显得有些激动。
On a bed just one metre from the dead, a dysfunctional old man was lying, and he saw the full-body protectors in the room, their eyes wide with excitement.
但他发不出声音，手也被布条捆在床杆上，只能小幅度的上下滑动，意义不明，或者根本没有意义。
But he could not make a sound, and his hands were bound to the bed-post by strips of cloth, sliding only slightly up and down, without meaning or meaning.
1月26日，救护车抵达医院，张静协助患者下车。
On 26 January, the ambulance arrived at the hospital and Zhang Jing assisted the patient to get off.
护士张静和司机老胡是武汉市第四医院的一个急救班组成员在陶玲开死亡证明时，我回到了走廊观察。
Nurse Zhang Jing and driver Lao Hu, a member of an emergency team at Wuhan's Fourth Hospital, returned to the corridor to observe Tao Lingkai's death certificate.
老人们没有任何防护措施，他们聚在有电视看的过道里，或者聚在走廊尽头有阳光的地方，除了电视机在发出声音，这条走廊非常安静。
The elderly had no protection. They gathered in the TV-watching aisle, or in the sun at the end of the hallway, which was very quiet except for the sound of the television.
过道里的老人，不是真的在看电视，他们有的闭着眼睛，有的看着我，我看着他们，也没有话说。
The elderly in the hallway, not really watching TV, some of them closed their eyes, some looked at me, I looked at them, also can not say.
开完死亡证明，我们回到了急救站。
After the death certificate, we're back at the emergency station.
陶玲教我，先要洗手，把手套扔掉，再把防护服小心翼翼地脱下来，它的质料很薄，可千万别弄破了，毕竟是要用一天的。
Tao Ling taught me to wash my hands first, throw away my gloves, and then take off my protective clothing carefully. The material is very thin.
脱下来的防护服挂在急救车里，车内的紫外线可以消毒。
Take off the protective clothing hanging in the ambulance, the ultraviolet light inside the car can be disinfected.
约半小时后，我们再次出车，这次是运输一位腹痛患者，疑似有肾脏结石。
About half an hour later, we were traveling again, this time to transport a patient with abdominal pain, suspected to have kidney stones.
急救车将他送到了普仁医院的急诊科。
The ambulance took him to the emergency department of Puren Hospital.
“情况明显好转了。
"Things are definitely better.
”陶玲看着我，她清楚我来访的目的，这一趟没有遇上。
Tao Ling looked at me. She knew the purpose of my visit.
她说，救护车现在运输的病人，很少有发热的了，因为发热病人一般由社区登记，再由社区对接隔离点、方舱医院或者定点医院。
She says ambulances are now transporting fewer patients with fever, who are typically registered by the community and then docked to isolation points, square-cabin hospitals or designated hospitals.
“早一周来的话，你能看到的，全部是发热病人，而且几乎都是新冠肺炎患者。
"All you could see a week earlier were febrile patients, and almost all were patients with Newcastle pneumonia.
”司机李林对此记忆深刻，他说，在刚过年的几天，病人太多但救护车太少，他们常常接到十几二十公里外的单子。
The driver, Li Lin, who remembered the incident well, said that in the past few days there were too many patients but too few ambulances, and they often received orders from a dozen or twenty kilometres away.
到了医院，大厅、过道里都是病人，太多的人等待核酸检测来确诊，否则无法得到床位。
Hospitals, halls, and aisles are filled with patients, and too many people wait for nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, otherwise no beds are available.
然而，核酸试剂盒与床位都太少了，由此形成了一个“怪圈”：得不到确诊和床位的病人们，大量而重复地来医院排队，反而进一步加剧了病毒传播。
However, there are too few nucleic acid test kits and beds, creating a "vicious circle" of undiagnosed and untreated patients queuing up at hospitals in large numbers, only to exacerbate the spread of the virus.
据央视2月17日报道，国家卫健委官员接受采访时说，在武汉初期，很多病例没有得到及时救治。
In the early days of Wuhan, many cases were not treated in time, state health officials said in an interview with state health officials.
“重症病人从发病到住院的时间平均9.84天，说明有10天的时间变成了移动的传染源。
"The average length of time from onset of illness to hospitalization was 9.84 days, indicating that there were 10 days to become a mobile source of infection.
”官方在后来加大了防控力度，相继实行分级诊疗等制度，社区成为病人与医院之间的“把关人”。
Officials have since stepped up prevention and control efforts, successively implementing a graduated system of diagnosis and treatment, with the community becoming the "gatekeeper" between patients and hospitals.
对李林来说，最直接的感受是，需要救护车运输的病人变少了，现在每天的出车量是10趟多一点，接近平时的每天7、8趟。
For Li Lin, the most immediate feeling is that fewer patients need to be transported by ambulance, which now travels a little more than 10 times a day, nearly seven or eight times a day.
病人也以非新冠肺炎患者为主，事实上，在武汉越发严格的管制措施下，新冠肺炎病人还拥有社区的通道，而其他病人如在“孤岛”，更需要救护车来运输。
Patients also tend to be patients with non-Newly Crown Pneumonia, who in fact have access to the community under increasingly stringent Wuhan control measures, while other patients who are on "isolated islands" need ambulances to transport them.
120急救车穿过鹦鹉洲长江大桥李林没能说完他的话，烟才刚刚点燃，警铃又响了。
120 First-aid vehicle across Parrot Island Changjiang Bridge Li Lin did not finish his words, just lit the smoke, alarm bell rang again.
陶玲跑到门口叫他：“出车了！”她特地又对我喊道：“这次是个发热病人！”不到10分钟，救护车开到了丹青苑小区的门口，病人是个70多岁的老爷子，他被老伴搀扶着徐徐走来。
Tao Ling ran to the door and called to him: "Out of the car!" She specifically called to me: "This is a feverish patient!" Less than 10 minutes later, the ambulance arrived at the gate of Danqing Yuan District.
不过，他对医生说：“我没有发烧。
However, he said to the doctor, "I have no fever.
”他不想去定点医院。
He didn't want to book a hospital.
陶玲做好了全身防护，把他扶上了救护车。
Tao Ling made full body protection and helped him into the ambulance.
她没多说什么，拿出体温计给老爷子，叫他量一量。
She said nothing more. She took out the thermometer and told him to take it.
老爷子起初不肯，强调自己没有发烧，陶玲解释说：“不是说你有那个病，是现在的情况下，每个病人都要量体温。
At first he would not, stressing that he did not have a fever. Tao Ling explained, "Not that you have that disease, but that in the present case, every patient needs to have his temperature taken.
如果你发烧了，去急诊科也没用，他们不会收。
If you have a fever, it's no use going to the emergency department. They won't take it.
去了也要量体温的。
You're gonna have to take your temperature.
”老爷子听了，只好量起体温，陶玲两次嘱咐说：“夹紧、夹紧。
"Hearing this, the old man had to take his temperature, and Tao Ling charged twice," Clamp and clamp.
”体温量出来是37.6摄氏度，属于低烧。
The temperature, measured at 37.6 degrees Celsius, is low.
老爷子和他老伴很纳闷儿，说刚刚量时都没烧。
Old man son and his wife are very stuffy, say just measured time did not burn.
陶玲没争什么，她甩了甩体温计，安慰老爷子说：“没事啊，没事，我们再量一次。
Tao Ling had nothing to argue about. She shook her thermometer and comforted the old man. "It's OK. It's OK. Let's take another look.
”结果依然是37.6度低烧。
The result was still a 37.6 degree low fever.
但是，两位老人执意不去定点医院，他们怕去了被交叉感染。
However, the two elderly people insisted on not ordering a hospital, they were afraid of cross-infection.
救护车最后开到了普仁医院的发热门诊，两位老人进去挂号了。
The ambulance finally arrived at Puren Hospital's fever clinic, two old people went in to register.
回去站点的路上，陶玲和李林相视笑了笑，他们见多了这种情况。
On the way back to the site, Tao Ling and Li Lin smiled at each other. They saw more of this.
“病人不说实话，是怕我们不送他了。
"The patient did not tell the truth, for fear that we should not send him.
有的是侥幸心理，觉得自己不是新冠肺炎，很排斥去定点医院。
Have a lot of luck, feel oneself is not new crown pneumonia, very ostracism goes to a point hospital.
”陶玲解释说。
'she explained.
另一个“怪圈”出了4趟车后，时间将近中午1点，站长端出了盒饭。
Another "strange circle" out of four trains, it is nearly 1: 00 noon, the station master brought out a box of rice.
陶玲和护士两位女性在办公室，边谈笑边吃饭，不一会儿饭盒见底。
Tao Ling and the nurse were in the office, chatting and laughing, and the lunch box soon bottomed out.
陶玲看到我的碗里还有少量饭菜，突然不好意思起来，捂着嘴笑说：“我是不是吃太快了？”她又赶紧辩解：“没办法嘛，我们干这一行，平时2分钟就吃完了。
When Tao Ling saw that there was a small amount of food in my bowl, she suddenly felt embarrassed, put her hand over her mouth and said, "Am I eating too fast?" She said hurriedly.
”确实，在急救站里，做事都是争分夺秒。
Indeed, in a first-aid station, everything is a race against the clock.
午饭过后，5个人很快回到宿舍。
After lunch, the five men quickly returned to the dorm.
他们要抓紧时间休息，因为在这一天的24小时里，他们都要准备着随时出发。
They want to take time off, because they will be ready to go for the 24 hours of the day.
他们这天的运气不错，午休了1个小时，也睡得很沉。
They had a good day. They took an hour's lunch break and slept soundly.
直到下午2点，铃声终于响起。
At last the bell rang at 2 p.m.
众人被惊醒，很快在两三分钟内集合完毕。
The crowd woke up and gathered in two or three minutes.
他们还不知道，即将出的这趟车，是近些天里最难的一趟。
They didn't know that the coming train was the hardest in recent days.
1月26日，一天的工作临近结束，张静和老胡来到武汉市急救中心的消毒点为车辆和自己彻底消毒病人在武钢医院。
On January 26, near the end of the day's work, Zhang Jing and Lao Hu came to the disinfection point of Wuhan city emergency medical center for vehicles and their own thorough disinfection patients in WISCO Hospital.
没过多久，救护车开到了院区。
Before long, the ambulance reached the compound.
是位71岁的男性老人，躺在一张不知哪儿来的床上，两名男性家属陪护着他。
He was a 71-year-old man lying in an unknown bed, accompanied by two male family members.
他们显然是被拒收了，只能在发热门诊的门前、医院绿化带的边上，等着救护车给他们一个去处。
They were apparently turned away, waiting for an ambulance to give them a place in front of the hot clinic, on the edge of the hospital's green belt.
陶玲接过诊断报告，一看：“陈XX，男……考虑为：细菌性肺炎。
Tao Ling took over the diagnosis report and saw: "Chen XX, male... consideration is: Bacterial pneumonia.
”他罹患了细菌性肺炎，而新冠肺炎是“病毒性肺炎”。
He developed bacterial pneumonia, which is called viral pneumonia.
武钢医院在2月15日被征用为定点医院了，不能再收治他。
Wuhan Iron and Steel Hospital was requisitioned as a designated hospital on February 15 and can no longer be admitted.
然而，他的情况十分危急，血象指标达到了19000（正常人在8000~9000）。
However, his condition is critical, with a blood count of 19,000 (8000-9000 normal).
他躺在床上，呼吸都非常吃力，疼痛中发出浑浊的声音，眼睛无法睁开，没有说话能力。
He was lying in bed, breathing hard, making a muddy sound in pain, eyes unable to open, unable to speak.
一位家属告诉陶玲：“武钢现在只收病毒肺炎了，快把我爸转到普仁医院去。
A family member told Tao Ling: "Wu Gang now only accept viral pneumonia, quickly transfer my father to Puren Hospital.
”陶玲明白，事情没那么简单。
Tao Ling understood that the matter was not so simple.
武钢医院是不能收治了，但普仁医院也不能说去就去。
Wuhan Iron and Steel Hospital is unable to accept the treatment, but Puren Hospital can not say to go.
现在全力抗“疫”时期，收治非新冠病人的医院太少，床位一定很稀缺。
There are too few hospitals for non-crown patients, and beds must be scarce.
陶玲对病人家属说：“到时候还不能收治，就连这张露天的床也没有了。
"We won't be able to take care of it yet, not even this open bed," Tao Ling told her family.
他情况又这么严重，站都站不了，怎么排队？等得及吗？”家属坚持要先转出去，病人儿子陈章明说：“这里肯定收不了了，何况他一个细菌性肺炎的，在这里交叉感染了怎么办？”做了决定后，担架员将病人抬上了救护车，一路开到普仁医院的急诊科。
How can he wait in line when he is so serious that he cannot stand? The family insists on turning out first, and the patient's son, Chen Zeming, says: "There must be no place for him, not to mention the fact that he has a bacterial pneumonia and is cross-infected here.
和陶玲的猜测一样，来对接的医生摆手，表示收不了。
Like Tao Ling's guess, the doctor who came to the docking waved his hand and said he could not take it.
她对陶玲和家属说：“现在一个床位也没有了。
"There's not a single bed left," she told Tao Ling and her family.
”她指了指旁边的病区，说：“不信我可以把门打开给你们看，我们这里吸氧的地方都没有了。
"She pointed to the next sick area and said," If you don't believe me, I can open the door for you.
这里还有疑似新冠肺炎的患者，现在还转不出去。
There are also suspected cases of New Crown Pneumonia, now unable to turn out.
”接着，两边陷入了无用的对话。
Then the two sides lapsed into useless dialogue.
陶玲拿出诊断报告，说病人情况很危急，但又不是新冠肺炎，只能来普仁医院了。
Tao Ling took out a diagnostic report, said the patient is in a critical condition, but is not new crown pneumonia, can only come to Puren Hospital.
家属试图“软硬兼施”，说要打“市长热线”。
The family tried to be "soft and hard" and said they wanted to call the "mayor's hotline."
女医生仍是摆手，重复地说“收不了”。
Again the woman waved her hand and repeated, "No way."
她说：“我们（医院）没有床啊。
"We don't have a bed," she said.
我病区这里还有两具尸体，就放在那里，不知道什么时候能拖走、把床位腾出来。
I still have two bodies here in the sick area, and I don't know when they'll be able to drag them away and make them available.
现在殡仪馆都排了很长的队。
There are long queues at the funeral parlour.
我估计你们病人也等不了这么长时间。
I don't think your patients can wait that long.
听明白没有？”她接着说，排除了新冠肺炎的，还可以去同济、协和、湖北省人民医院，它们也收非新冠肺炎的病人。
"Do you understand me?" She went on, ruling out pneumonia, and going to Tongji, Concorde and Hubei People's Hospital, which also collected patients with non-Newly Coronet Pneumonia.
家属似乎看到了希望，问：“它们会不会也没有床位？”医生回答说：“有可能，你试一下啊。
The family seemed to see hope and asked, "Will they also have no beds?" The doctor replied, "It is possible. Try it.
不试一下连希望都没了。
If you don't try, there's no hope.
”白跑一趟后，在下午3点半，救护车来到了湖北省人民医院。
After a vain trip, the ambulance arrived at the People's Hospital in Hubei Province at 3.30 p.m.
他们把病人留在车上，陶玲和家属先到急诊科咨询。
They left the patients in the car and Tao Ling and her family went to the emergency department for consultation.
但是，希望又落空了。
But hope has fallen through again.
其实，走入省人民院的急诊科时，答案就很明显了。
In fact, into the emergency department of the provincial Wolesi Jirga, the answer is obvious.
人满为患，前台大厅都摆满了床位，把空间切割成了狭窄的过道。
Overcrowding, the front desk lobby is full of beds, the space cut into a narrow corridor.
病人和家属来来往往，每个床边都拥挤不堪。
The sick and the family came and went, each bed crowded.
前台的护士对陶玲说：“你自己看，现在真住不了院，在这里的病人也在排队等，现在连这儿都住不下了。
The nurse at the front desk said to Tao Ling, "You see, you can't really live in the hospital right now.
”护士说的没错，尽管大厅、走廊，还有部分科室，都临时改成了病房，床也尽可能地多铺了，但仍然不够。
"The nurse was right, and although the hall, hallways and sections were temporarily converted into wards and beds were made as many as possible, they were not enough.
还有病人在等待，还有新的病人想加入。
There are patients waiting. There are new patients who want to join.
家属试着软磨硬泡，把危急的情形告诉护士。
The family tried to grind and tell the nurse the critical situation.
但护士在看了单子后，更加坚定地说：“收不了。
But the nurse looked at the list and said more firmly, "No, I can't.
”她解释说，病人的问题在肺部，有可能是新冠肺炎，只有完全排除了新冠肺炎，急诊科才能收治。
She explained that the patient's problem was in the lungs, possibly a new crown pneumonia, and that the emergency department would be able to treat it only if pneumonia was completely eliminated.
武钢医院出具了报告，诊断为“细菌性肺炎”，这还不够吗？前台护士表示，不够。
Wu Gang hospital issued a report, diagnosed as "bacterial pneumonia," this is not enough? Front Desk Nurse said, not enough.
她对家属说：“你要去做两次核酸检测，要两次都是阴性。
"You're going to have two nucleic acid tests, both negative," she told her family.
再去做CT检查，判断没有问题，才能完全排除新冠肺炎。
To do a CT examination, the judgement is not a problem, can completely exclude the new crown pneumonia.
”在这套流程走完后，病人才能被急诊科收治。
After the procedure was completed, the patient was admitted to the emergency department.
家属决定再试一次，下午5点左右，救护车再次载着他们，往同济医院开去。
The family decided to try again and at around 5 p.m. the ambulance took them again to Tongji Hospital.
一路奔波了4小时，尽管病人的体征参数没有恶化，但体力过度透支，两次呕吐出黑色的液体。
After four hours of traveling, the patient's signs did not deteriorate, but he overworked and vomited black liquid twice.
他似乎极为痛苦，在担架床上费力地翻动着，却只能一次次把枕头推下床。
He seemed to be in great pain, writhing laboriously on the stretcher bed, but he could only push the pillow out of bed again and again.
病人儿子很疲惫了，他哀求道：“老爹，你不要扳了，医院不收能怎么办？你又不是得的那种病（新冠肺炎）。
The sick man's son was tired and he begged, "Daddy, don't pull the trigger. What can you do if the hospital doesn't take it? You're not suffering from that disease.
”同济医院也拒绝了收治，理由直接得多。
Tongji Hospital refused to be admitted for much more immediate reasons.
急诊科的医务人员说，武汉现在实行分区管理，病人一家是在青山区，但同济医院是在硚口区，“跨了区的，不能办理住院”。
The emergency department medical staff said Wuhan is now under district management, the patient is in the Qingshan area, but Tongji Hospital is in the Zhangkou District, "across the district, can not be hospitalized."
最后，病人和家属又回到了起点：武钢医院。
Finally, the patient and the family returned to the starting point: Wuhan Iron and Steel Hospital.
陶玲对医务人员解释了前后因果，尽管还是不能住院，但得到了一个留观的床位。
Tao Ling explained the cause and effect to the medical staff, although still can not be hospitalized, but got a visiting bed.
出了这趟车后，每个人都有些疲惫，陶玲回到宿舍关起门休息。
After this train, everyone was a little tired, Tao Ling returned to her dorm and closed the door to rest.
到她决定出门买泡面时，天已经全黑了。
By the time she decided to go out and buy noodles, it was already dark.
