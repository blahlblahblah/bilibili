农贸市场不行了，开发别的供需渠道，交易风险高了，涨价，越来越地下、越来越暴利浙江省杭州市淳安县汾口镇被当街宰杀的黄麂 图/受访者供图又有一只黄麂的脖子被划开了。
The farmers' market failed to develop other supply and demand channels, trading risks were high, prices went up, more and more underground, more and more profitless Zhejiang Province Chun'an County, Linfen Town was slaughtered in the street.
卖家抓住它两条后腿——其中一条已被猎夹夹断，将它倒提起来。
The seller grabbed it by the hind legs - one of them had been snapped and lifted upside down.
鲜血迅速流向下水道，十几个围观者聊得热络。
Blood was pouring down the drain and a dozen bystanders were chatting.
黄麂发不出声，两只前蹄朝地面奋力蹬着。
Yellow muntjac did not make a sound, two front feet toward the ground vigorously pedal.
这里是今年1月中旬浙江省杭州市淳安县汾口镇野味市场的一角。
This is the mid-January of this year Zhejiang Province Chun'an County, Linfen Town Game Market corner.
放血、割角、烫皮、拔毛、切块，都摊在马路边流水线操作。
Bleeding, cutting, ironing, plucking, cutting, all spread out in the roadside assembly line operation.
狍子那么大的黄麂，有人一买就是一整只，不知道来源于野生动物的新型冠状病毒肺炎，正在全国蔓延。
Roe Roe son so big yellow muntjac, some people buy is a whole, do not know the new coronavirus pneumonia from wild animals, is spreading throughout the country.
截至3月12日20：00，全国累计确诊新冠肺炎80981例，死亡3173例。
As of 20: 00 on March 12, a total of 80,981 new cases of pneumonia and 3,173 deaths had been diagnosed nationwide.
国外累计确诊47358例，死亡1550例。
A total of 47,358 cases and 1550 deaths were diagnosed abroad.
自1989年《中华人民共和国野生动物保护法》实施以来，开发利用野生动物资源都需遵守规定。
Since the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wild Animals came into force in 1989, exploitation and utilization of wildlife resources have been subject to regulations.
20多年里，该法案经历了4次修订，刑法中也对非法猎捕做出明确的量刑规定。
The Act has been amended four times in more than 20 years, and illegal hunting is clearly defined in the Penal Code.
但各地的野味市场一直存在，盗猎屡禁不止。
But game markets exist everywhere, and poaching continues unabated.
2月27日，国家林草局野生动植物保护司副司长王维胜表示，在疫情期间实施“最严野生动物管控措施”，全面禁止人工繁殖场所野生动物转运贩卖，禁止一切形式的野生动物交易。
On February 27, Wang Weisheng, deputy director of the Wildlife Conservation Department of the State Forestry and Forestry Administration, said that during the outbreak, "strict wildlife control measures" had been implemented, imposing a total ban on the trans-shipment of wild animals from artificial breeding sites and prohibiting all forms of wildlife trading.
3月10日，生态环境部新闻发言人刘友宾表示，拟将野生动物保护情况纳入中央环保督察。
On March 10, Liu Youbin, spokesman for the Ministry of Ecological Environment, said that wildlife protection would be included in the Central Environmental Inspectorate.
尽管如此，多方新闻报道仍显示，疫情期间，浙江、河南等地均有人因非法猎捕野生动物被拘役，辽宁甚至有人戴着口罩去鸟市交易野生候鸟。
However, various news reports indicate that people were detained for hunting wild animals illegally in Zhejiang and Henan during the epidemic period. Some even wore masks and went to the Bird Market to trade wild migratory birds.
疫情期间，多地出现非法狩猎人士 图/网页截图同时曝光“顶风作案”现象的，还有国内的野生动物保护组织和反盗猎组织。
During the outbreak, illegal hunter-gatherer charts / web screenings were also published, along with national wildlife groups and anti-poaching groups.
多年来，二者分别在保护种群和打击犯罪上起到了重要作用。
Over the years, the two have played important roles in protecting stocks and fighting crime, respectively.
杨斐（化名），1987年出生，2016年8月全职加入民间反盗猎组织，近4年里拆捕鸟网、暗访农贸市场、和盗猎分子接头，身经百战。
Yang Fei (alias), born in 1987, joined the Civil Anti-Pirate Hunting Organization full-time in August 2016, and has spent the past four years breaking down and trawling bird nets, unannounced visits to farmers' markets, and poaching connections.
他的一线现场经历，或许能为我们提供另一种视角。
His first-hand experience on the ground may provide us with another perspective.
以下是他的自述：不亏本的买卖我是从2016年开始反盗猎的。
Here's his self-talk: "A no-loss deal." I started poaching in 2016.
当时北京正在招保护候鸟志愿者，我刚刚辞职，又对爬山、钻林子很感兴趣，看到能去一线拆捕鸟网，果断报了名。
At that time, Beijing was recruiting volunteers to protect migratory birds, I just resigned, and again interested in climbing mountains, drilling woods, see can go to the first line to dismantle and catch birds, decisively reported.
我本来以为首都不会有多少盗猎分子。
I thought there wouldn't be a lot of poachers in the capital.
巡视多了才发现，这里的非法捕鸟现象非常严重。
It took a lot of inspections to find out that the illegal bird-hunting was very serious.
四五环外的荒山、河边，只要是候鸟迁徙路过的地方，都能找到捕鸟网。
Outside the Fourth Five-Year Ring, barren hills, rivers, as long as the migration of birds through the place, can find a net.
核心地区能同时有4、5个猎捕点，一踏进去，能听见机器模拟的鸟叫声从各个方向传来，响亮、重复，争着引候鸟掉进陷阱。
The core can hold four or five hunting grounds at a time, and once inside, one can hear the sounds of simulated birds coming from all directions, loud and repetitive, competing for the birds to fall into the trap.
无奈举报容易惩罚难。
It is easier to report than punish.
从法律上讲，在禁猎期用禁止工具捕鸟属于刑事案件，要拘留的。
Legally speaking, the use of prohibited tools to catch birds during the hunting ban is a criminal offence and is subject to detention.
可北京的捕鸟人绝大部分是六七十岁的老头，他们涉案数量少，抓的鸟又是非重点保护动物，基本不会受到严厉惩戒。
But Beijing's birdcatchers, mostly 60 or 70-year-olds, are involved in a small number of cases, catch birds are non-protected animals, and will not be severely disciplined.
有个老头被我抓了三回，抓到当场放鸟，完全拿他没办法；还有个老头刚进森林公安局就躺地上“犯病”，不知道真的假的。
I caught an old man three times and set the bird free on the spot. There was another old man who was lying on the ground at the Forest Police Station and didn't know whether it was real or not.
去年12月，江西省赣州市信丰县，一位老人在自家房顶架捕鸟网。
Last December, an old man set up a bird net on the roof of his home in Xinfeng county, Jiangxi province.
图/受访者供图2016年9月，我和十几个志愿者接到爆料线索，在河北唐山端了一个候鸟盗猎窝点。
Figure / Interviewee: Chart In September 2016, a dozen volunteers and I received a tip about a bird poaching nest in Tangshan, Hebei Province.
这是我全职反盗猎以来协助森林公安办的第一个“大案”，现场共清点出36000只活鸟，裹着纱网的木箱子，每箱大约能装20只鸟，销毁了2000多个。
This was my first major case to assist FSO since I became a full-time poacher, where 36,000 live birds were counted, wooden cases wrapped in gauze nets, each containing about 20 birds, and more than 2,000 were destroyed.
这也是我第一次见识到野味市场有多疯狂。
This is the first time I've seen how crazy a game market is.
36000只活鸟中有6000只禾花雀，这种学名为黄胸鹀的小鸟因被传有“壮阳”功效，在起步价为5-10元/只的野味交易市场，能卖到150元/只。
Among the 36,000 live birds, the bunting bird, known as the Embergris bunting, can fetch up to $150 per bird at a starting price of $5 to $10 per bird.
结果呢？以前和麻雀一样多的禾花雀从2000年到2017年实现了濒危等级“五级跳”，硬生生被人类从“无危”吃成“极危”。
As a result, as many sparrows as there used to be, from 2000 to 2017, they achieved an endangered rating of "Grade 5," abruptly transformed by humans from "endangered" to "critically endangered."
然而，即便是盗猎这种级别的林鸟，最后的惩戒措施也十分有限。
However, even poaching forest birds of this level results in very limited disciplinary measures.
至少我遇到的案例大都是罚款、没收工具了事，判刑的很少超过三年。
At least most of the cases I encountered were fines, confiscation of tools, and the sentences were rarely more than three years.
倒不是说森林公安不好，大环境就是这样：小型林鸟哪怕卖得再贵，只要是非重点保护动物，都算不上刑事案件，只卖一两只的举报出去更没人管；重点案例按法定量刑标准，需要判刑的，有轻判趋势。
This is not to say that the forest public security is not good, this is the general environment: small forest birds, no matter how expensive they sell, as long as they are not important to protect animals are not criminal cases, even more so if only one or two reports are sold.
市场利润高，犯罪成本低，没人会主动终止不亏本的买卖。
Market profits are high, crime costs are low, and no one will voluntarily stop selling at a loss.
为了满足人们对野味的需求，他们甚至把猫头鹰变成农贸市场的肉货，把熊掌端到哈尔滨某学校食堂。
In order to meet the demand for game, they even turned owls into meat from farmers' markets and brought bear paws to a school canteen in Harbin.
估计禾花雀快抓绝的时候，跟它体型类似的其它鸟就开始“壮阳”了。
It is estimated that when the grasshopper is nearly dead, other birds of a similar size begin to "imbue the sun."
反正吃的人分不出来，拔光鸟毛煲汤，一盆一样能卖上千元。
Anyway, people can not separate out, plucking bird hair soup, a pot can be sold thousands of dollars.
合法之谜现在提起疫情，大家都知道武汉卖野味的华南海鲜市场。
Lawful Mystery Now that the epidemic is under way, Wuhan's venison-selling seafood market in southern China is well known.
实际上早在2017年，农贸市场卖野生动物的现象已经很严重了。
In fact, as early as 2017, the phenomenon of selling wild animals at farmers' markets is already very serious.
尤其是抓野鸭全国出名的安徽省。
Especially to catch wild ducks famous throughout the country Anhui Province.
2017年6月，我们团队去安徽省黄山市歙县的农贸市场暗访。
In June 2017, our team made an unannounced visit to the Shexian County Farmers Market in Huangshan, Anhui Province.
一连5个摊位，表面摆的是蛇跟蛙，一问水鸟、斑鸠、小型猛禽全有。
Five stalls, the surface of the snake and frog, a water bird, turtledove, small birds of prey all have.
我们直接去森林公安局举报（打电话经常会遇到非常拖延的出警），执法人员来了后，在每家都搜出了装着国家重点保护动物的小冰箱。
We went directly to the Forest and Public Security Bureau to report (calls often encounter very delayed police), and when the law enforcement officers arrived, each house was searched for a small refrigerator containing a state-protected animal.
通过长期跟踪这些农贸市场，我们发现了一个明显的趋势：他们越来越“合法”了。
By keeping track of these farmers' markets for a long time, we see a clear trend: they are becoming more and more "legal."
在市场贩卖野生动物，需要有工商营业执照和野生动物经营许可证。
Trade in wildlife on the market requires an industrial and commercial license and a wildlife business license.
浙江省金华市磐安县一处农贸市场，有6个摊位卖野味。
Zhejiang Jinhua City Panan County a farmers' market, there are six stalls selling game.
我们在2017年12月举报过一次，他们只有执照，被查收了好几吨野生动物。
We reported it once, in December 2017, that they had only licences and had several tons of wild animals seized.
今年1月，我们又接到这个地方的爆料，再去现场，他们摊位的墙上全贴了野生动物经营许可证。
In January of this year, we received more material from the area and went to the scene. All the walls of their stalls were covered with wildlife permits.
需要明确的是，野生动物经营许可证会规定经营的物种种类和数量，并且要求卖的野生动物必须有合法来源：一是养殖场，这是主要来源；二是合法猎捕，比如有的地方野兔泛滥，当地林业部门会按配额发狩猎证，让你按规定的时间、地点、物种、数量来打。
It is important to be clear that licences for wildlife operations specify the types and quantities of species to be traded and require that the wildlife sold be of legal origin: first, breeding grounds, which are the main source, and second, legal hunting, such as the proliferation of rabbits in places where the local forestry department issues hunting licences, allowing you to fight at the time, place, species and quantity specified.
但这些商贩却拿着证找盗猎分子超范围大肆收购。
But these traders are holding cards for poachers to go on a buying spree.
好多我们举报的有证商家，一口咬定自己是养殖场进货，你让他拿进货单据，根本拿不出来。
We report a lot of licensed businesses, firmly believe that they are breeding farms, you let him take the bill of lading, not out.
那些野兔、野猪的腿，明显是猎夹夹断的，他们还能狡辩成“为了假装野生的卖个好价格，故意为之”。
The hare and boar's legs, apparently clipped by hunting clips, could also be chicanery "deliberately used to sell wild animals for a good price."
线上办证图/受访者供图向上追溯，作为主要“合法来源”的养殖场也是同一番景象。
Online identity cards / interviewees can be traced back up, as are farms that are a major "legal source."
你会看到很多养殖场，在拿到驯养繁殖许可证后，迅速实现了野生动物的规模化人工繁殖。
You'll see a lot of farms that, with domesticated breeding licenses, quickly grow wild animals on a large scale.
把保护、利用、科研等理由混在一块，他们办证很容易。
It's easy to mix protection, use, scientific research, etc.
有的养殖场甚至本身就是盗猎窝点。
Some farms are even poaching dens themselves.
我见过一个养野鸭的养殖场，水面下是一大张猎捕网。
I have seen a duck farm, and below the surface is a large hunting net.
迁徙季节到了，他们会用拟声机器把鸟引下来。
As the migration season approached, they would use sound machines to guide the birds down.
总之，外面抓的、天上掉的，只要一进来，马上“洗白”成合法的。
In short, caught outside, the sky fell, as long as one enters, immediately "wash white" into the legal.
广东省江门市还有一家以科研名义办证的白鹭养殖场，这么多年也没研究明白怎么人工繁殖。
Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, there is also a scientific name to operate a heron farm, so many years also did not understand how to artificially propagate.
要在高树上筑巢、在水里吃鱼的苍鹭，所在的养殖场全是水泥地。
Herons that build nests in tall trees and eat fish in water are raised entirely on cement.
连筑巢环境都没有，你指着铁丝网里密密麻麻的上千只鸟说是在养殖场交配的？可这些我们看来很常识的漏洞，有些林业部门带着地方的动物专家去例行检查，不觉得有问题。
You point to thousands of birds in a barbed-wire fence saying they mate on a farm, but these seemingly common-sense holes, some of which are routinely checked by local animal experts, don't feel problematic.
有证，就是合法。
Where there is a certificate, it is legal.
所以，我们一直呼吁全面清查商业化的野生动物驯养繁殖场，根本无法实现规模化人工繁殖的可以收回证件。
That is why we have been calling for a comprehensive inventory of commercial wildlife breeding grounds, unable to achieve large-scale artificial reproduction of recoverable documents.
不排除真的有肯烧钱、花大把时间搭场景研究繁殖的人，但庞大的市场需求刺激下，更多人为的，是搞个厂子赚钱。
Do not rule out that there are really willing to burn money, spend a lot of time with the scene to study reproduction, but huge market demand stimulation, more artificial is to make money.
和盗猎势力交锋2019年全年，我们共向各地执法部门提供野生动物伤害线索790条，收到反馈184条。
Confronting with poachers Throughout 2019, we have provided law enforcement authorities with 790 wildlife injury leads and received 184 responses.
这个数据表现比2018年（提供线索652条，反馈约220条）要差不少。
This is a far cry from 2018, when 652 leads were provided and about 220 responses were received.
我不好分析原因，只能说，举报远不是大家想的那么容易。
I am not easy to analyze the reasons, can only say that reporting is far from everyone's idea so easy.
首先，远程打电话肯定成不了。
First of all, remote calls are bound to fail.
敢公开贩卖野生动物的大都证件齐全，工商部门管不着。
Most of the documents for openly selling wild animals are complete and beyond the control of the business sector.
超经营范围的野味多藏在库房，林业部门看到有证，很少进去查。
Over-range of game hidden in the warehouse, the forestry sector saw a certificate, rarely go in to check.
其次，线下举报的限制非常大。
Second, the limitations of offline reporting are significant.
去年，我们的志愿者在安徽省暗访到一个大型蛇类养殖场，在库房发现了三四吨收购来的蛇。
Last year, our volunteers secretly visited a large snake farm in Anhui Province and found three or four tons of snakes in the warehouse.
他蹲到了收购现场，拍了视频，报了警，所做的一切却只能证明视频里的几条蛇是收购的。
He squatted down to the scene, filmed the video, called the police, and did all he could to prove that the snakes in the video were bought.
那人家就把这几条蛇放了呗，剩下的又是有证即合法。
Then the man set the snakes free, and the rest were proved to be legal.
血腥的野味市场 图/受访者供图线上线下都不好操作，我们便开始尝试非常手段。
Bloody game market chart / interviewees are not easy to operate on or off the line, so we started to try extraordinary means.
宁夏固原市曾有三个“大贩子”，当然，谈不上穷凶极恶啊，是因为一直没人管才越做越大。
There used to be three "big dealers" in Guyuan, Ningxia. Of course, it is far from being vicious.
我们假装成进货的酒店人员去参观，把他们说的“三四千只随时发货”“野鸡是药死的，狍子是电网电死的”“放到装香蕉的盒子里，大货车运到西安中转”全录下来。
We pretended to be the incoming hotel staff, and delivered what they called "three or four thousand ready to deliver." Roe Roe was drugged and Roe Roe was electrically dead. "" Put it in a banana box and the van goes through Xi'an in transit. "
他们警惕性不高，一般不会发现。
They're not alert. They don't usually notice.
我们证据齐全，举报很顺利。
We have all the evidence and the report went well.
猛禽盗猎者要难对付得多。
Raptor poachers are much harder to deal with.
他们涉案金额高，做事隐蔽，很难见上一面。
They were involved in high-value cases that were hidden and difficult to see.
我和好多猛禽贩子远程视频过，有的“非要看看你”，我就戴个帽子露脸；有的要交定金，我就先和森林公安打招呼，别贩子没抓到，把自己搞进去了。
I've seen a lot of Raptor videos off-site, some of which are "must see you," and I've got a hat on my face. Some have to pay a deposit, so I don't get caught by the predator and get myself in.
当交易谈妥了，我会说“找一个当地朋友帮我去提”。
When the deal was settled, I would say, "Get a local friend to fetch it for me."
“朋友”其实是当地森林公安，约好地点，给公安报信，我们靠这种方法抓了不少人。
"Friends" is actually the local forest security, a good location, to inform the public security, we arrested a lot of people in this way.
但有些检察院认为这属于“钓鱼执法”，不予判刑。
But some prosecutors say it is "phishing enforcement" and will not be sentenced.
2018年10月，我们通过QQ群发现了一个河北省保定市的“大贩子”。
In October 2018, we discovered a "big dealer" in Baoding, Hebei Province, through the QQ group.
他号称收了10只老鹰，要知道这属于特大案件，判刑要在十年以上的。
He claims to have taken in 10 hawks, which, you know, is an extremely big case, with a sentence of ten years or more.
保定是猛禽迁徙必经之地，我们曾多次协助当地森林公安。
Baoding is a necessary place for raptors to migrate. We have helped local forest police many times.
我立即提供了交易地点，对方却告诉我们，之前办的几个案子检察院有意见，说是“钓鱼”，这次必须要一个志愿者与之产生实际交易。
I immediately provided the location of the deal, but the other side told us that in previous cases the prosecutor's office had disagreed, saying it was "fishing," and this time a volunteer had to make a real deal with it.
我只好自己变成“当地朋友”。
I had to become a "local friend" myself.
交易时间定在晚上7点，贩子一会吃饭、一会失联，直到11点才现身。
Trading time is set at 7 p.m., the traffickers will eat a meal, a loss of connection, until 11 o'clock to show up.
交易地点也换了好几次，最终选在一个很黑的河边路口。
The trading place also changed several times, the final choice is in a very dark river intersection.
见到我之后，他打开了后备箱—— 8只老鹰，身上缠着黄胶带，4只头朝这边，4只头朝那边，眼睛发亮。
When he saw me, he opened the trunk -- eight eagles with yellow tape around them, four heads this way, four heads that way, their eyes bright.
“打包的时候飞了俩。
"Two when I was packing.
”他一边向我解释，一边拿起手机照明。
"As he explained to me, he picked up the phone and lit it.
我克制住内心的紧张，说开车过来装货，然后把埋伏在附近的森林公安带了过去。
I checked my nervousness and said I would drive over to load the goods and bring the forest police lying in ambush nearby.
那人撒腿就跑，森林公安追出了几十米，终于把他按在地上。
The man left his legs and ran. The forest police chased him for dozens of meters and finally put him on the ground.
谁是野味市场的真正源头？从我这几年的反盗猎经历来看，2017年下半年应该是盗猎分子最猖狂的时候。
Who is the real source of the game market? Judging from my years of poaching, the second half of 2017 should be the height of poaching.
那时短视频平台刚开始火，搜关键词“户外打野”，能看到很多人在上面直播捕猎过程、教捕猎技巧。
Then the short video platform just began to fire, search the keyword "outdoor game", can see many people on the live broadcast hunting process, teach hunting skills.
他们留手机号、微信号，地址能具体到村，毫不收敛。
They leave cell phone number, microsignal, address can be specific to the village, unrestrained.
而且他们非常会互动。
And they're very interactive.
我看过一个主播，镜头只拍猎夹，抓到猎物了，说“老铁们猜什么动物，刷礼物就给大家看”。
I saw a anchorman, shoot only clips, catch prey, say "the old iron guess what animals, brush gifts for everyone to see."
要是直播间有人看着不忍心，求他放生，主播就会让对方刷礼物到一定金额再放生。
If someone on the air doesn't have the heart to ask him to let go, the host will let him brush the gift to a certain amount of money before releasing it.
同时，这个人会被弹幕“骂死”，说她“圣母”什么的。
At the same time, this person would be "cursed to death" by the shrapnel, saying she was "Madonna" or something.
这两年网上的风声紧了很多，盗猎分子不怎么留私人信息了。
Over the past two years, the Internet has become much tighter, with poachers leaving little private information.
拍视频的顶多发一个猎夹，或者发一条路，专业的人能一眼看懂将有什么动物出现。
Video of the maximum number of a hunting clip, or a road, professional people can see what animals will appear at a glance.
对于这种现象，我们举报了，森林公安也很难核查。
We have reported this phenomenon, and it is very difficult to verify forest security.
线上平台会管，把作品删掉，或者封号几天，实际没什么效果。
Online platform will manage to delete the work, or cover a few days, the actual effect is nothing.
盗猎分子在短视频平台展示非洲野狗 图/受访者供图和短视频平台问题类似的，还有电商平台。
The poachers display African dingo charts / interviewees on short video platforms with similar problems to those on short video platforms, as well as electronic commerce platforms.
食客、卖家、非法养殖者、盗猎分子，看起来盗猎分子是野味链条的顶端。
Diners, sellers, illegal farmers, poachers, it seems, are at the top of the game chain.
但实际上，上面还有一类人——卖猎捕工具的人。
But in reality, there's another kind of person up there - the hunter-gatherer.
淘宝、咸鱼、转转、微店，搜盗猎工具的关键词，随时能买到。
Taobao, salty fish, around, micro-shop, poaching tools key words, ready to buy.
我们长期推动禁止售卖非法猎捕工具之后，有些平台会限制关键词，有向好趋势。
After a long campaign to ban the sale of illegal hunting tools, some platforms restrict keywords and have a positive trend.
不过贩子总有固定的渠道，想从根源上反盗猎真的很难。
However, traffickers always have a fixed channel, to the root of anti-poaching really difficult.
于是，我们亲眼见证了猎捕工具的一次次进化。
Thus, we have witnessed the evolution of hunting tools.
抓哺乳动物的电网，电伏一万伏以上，野猪类的大型野兽碰到直接打死；各种规格的猎夹、猎套，大的四五十公分宽，完全挣不脱。
A large wild animal of wild boar type encounters direct death. Hunting clip and hunting cover of various specifications, the width of 40-50 centimeters, can not be earned at all.
这两种工具每年都会误伤、误杀上山的人。
Both of these tools can accidentally injure and kill people on a mountain every year.
新鲜的捕鸟工具有“脖夹”，往土里一埋，上面放个玉米粒或面包虫，候鸟看到了下来低头一啄，脖子一下被夹断。
Fresh bird-catching tools include a nape, burying it in the ground with a corn or bread worm, and the migrating bird sees it coming down with a peck and a nip in the neck.
配合夹子使用的报警器，会在夹到猎物时发通知短信，省得猎手定时查看。
Coupled with the clip used alarm, will clip the prey when the notification text messages, so that hunters do not check regularly.
还有用于夜视的热成像、专门的野鸡药斑鸠药……一个好现象是，疫情暴发后，盗猎窝点能做到发现一个打掉一个。
There are also thermal imaging for night vision, specialty pheasant turtledoves... one good thing is that poaching dens can spot one after the outbreak.
以前出力不讨好，消极执法的、“既是裁判员又是运动员”的，我们全遇到过。
In the past, we have all encountered passive law enforcement, "both referees and athletes."
现在大家会积极动用刑侦技术找人，打击力度大了很多。
Now we will actively use criminal investigation technology to find people, the impact of a lot of strength.
可我觉得，一直严下去应该不太可能。
But I don't think it's likely to keep it down.
哪怕我们的“最严规定”全面禁食野生动物了，有关部门如果不经常检查、打击，野味市场就会继续存在。
Even if our "most stringent regulations" forbade all wild animals, the wild meat market would continue to exist if the relevant authorities did not check and crack down frequently.
农贸市场不行了，开发别的供需渠道，交易风险高了，涨价，越来越地下、越来越暴利。
Farmer market is unable to develop other supply and demand channels, trading risk is high, price increases, more and more underground, more and more profitless.
所以我认为，每一个人都应该通过疫情重新反思自己跟野生动物和大自然的关系。
So I think everyone should rethink their relationship with wildlife and nature through the epidemic.
这是最根本的。
That is fundamental.
我们经常戏称《野生动物保护法》是“野生动物利用法”，因为里面有很多条款告诉你，几级保护动物分别办什么证可以养，把野生动物当成资源去利用开发。
We often joke that the Wildlife Conservation Act is the Wildlife Use Act, because there are many provisions that tell you what to do to protect the animals separately and to use them as a resource.
希望这一次，我们能从根本上转换这个观点，把野生动物真正看成生态系统的一部分，而不是说保护它是为了利用它。
Hopefully, this time around, we can fundamentally change that view and treat wildlife as part of the ecosystem, not protect it for its own use.
