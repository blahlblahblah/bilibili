非常时期他们的存在是照亮黑暗的光在武汉坚守工作岗位的普通人户外探险队志愿者大象，打开后备箱，打开一个水果罐头，将糖水一饮而尽。
They are ordinary outdoor explorers who stick to their jobs in Wuhan. They open the trunk, open a can of fruit and drink the sugar and water.
1月23日武汉封城，1月26日，武汉实行中心城区机动车禁行管理，出租车停运，医护人员的住址分布在武汉三镇，上下班通行成了问题。
January 23, Wuhan sealing the city, January 26, Wuhan, the implementation of the central city motor vehicle management, taxi stop, the address of medical staff in Wuhan three towns, traffic became a problem.
户外探险队的大象报名加入志愿者车队，接送医护人员上下班。
Elephants from the outdoor expedition signed up to join the volunteer corps to take their staff to and from work.
用车高峰期，大象经常一天工作十几个小时，他吃个水果罐头补充能量，继续开车奔走在空旷的城市街道上，成为了“摆渡人”，连接起生活的希望。
Elephants often work more than a dozen hours a day during rush hours. He eats canned fruit to replenish his energy and continues to drive through empty city streets, becoming a "walker" who connects the hopes of life.
跟大象一样的人，在武汉，还有很多，他们是医护人员、理发师、外卖员、开锁师傅、救护车司机、志愿者……纪录片《在武汉》讲述了非常时期下，生活在武汉的普通人的日常生活，展现从病患到医护工作者在这场疫情中面对的一切，自2月26日起在B站开播，已更新2集。
Like the elephant, in Wuhan, there are many more, they are medical personnel, hairdressers, takeaway workers, unlock masters, ambulance drivers, volunteers... The documentary "In Wuhan" narrates the daily life of ordinary people living in Wuhan under extraordinary circumstances.
守望相助出现在《在武汉》第1集《车轮上的生命线》的女司机李少云，是周迅主演的微电影《女儿》的原型，她是生活在武汉的单亲妈妈，长年带着女儿依依开夜班出租车，风雨无阻。
Li Shaoyun, a driver for "Lifeline on Wheels" in Wuhan episode 1, is the prototype of Zhou Xun's microfilm "Daughter," a single mother living in Wuhan who has been driving a night taxi with her daughter for years, rain or shine.
疫情来袭，武汉出租车停运，李少云也想贡献自己的一份力量，报名加入志愿者车队，但是一直都没有通过。
The outbreak hit, Wuhan taxi suspension, Li Shaoyun also wanted to contribute their own strength, signed up to join the volunteer team, but has not passed.
于是李少云就帮忙为武汉志愿者车队协调信息，“像我们没有车的，又想出一份力，就在群里面收发一些需求信息。
Li Shaoyun then helped to coordinate information for the Wuhan volunteer team. "Like we don't have a car, we think of a force to send and receive some demand information inside the group.
”年幼的依依想出去玩，李少云安慰她，外面有病毒，待在家里才是安全的。
"Young Yi would like to go out to play, Li Shaoyun comfort her, there is a virus outside, stay at home is safe.
突如其来的新冠肺炎疫情，强行扭转了每一个武汉人的日常生活轨迹。
The sudden outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia forced a reversal of every Wuhan people's daily life trajectory.
“平常都说冒着生命危险，那都是形容词，这一次是百分之两百的，百分之三百的，百分之五百的，绝对不是形容词。
It is an adjective, this time two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, five hundred per cent, which is anything but an adjective.
”大象深知加入志愿者车队的危险。
Elephants know the dangers of joining volunteer convoys.
志愿者开车接送乘客同样报名当志愿者的出租车司机陈杰也说：“说不害怕那是假的。
Chen Jie, a taxi driver who volunteers as well, said: "It's not true to say you're not afraid.
”妻子担心陈杰，跟儿子在家牵挂着陈杰的安全，“你是我们的全部，你完了我们都完了。
His wife worried about Chen Jie and his son at home worrying about Chen Jie's safety. "You are all to us.
”陈杰还跟妻子开玩笑，“我在给你攒嫁妆呢。
Chen Jie joked with his wife. "I'm saving your dowry.
”每一个生活在武汉的普通人，都在跟疫情做斗争，虽然不知道胜利的那一天何时会到来，但依然在坚持着。
Every ordinary person living in Wuhan is struggling with the epidemic, and though he does not know when the day of victory will come, he still persists.
大象跟同伴们互相打气，“坚持啊，坚持。
The elephant and his companions encouraged each other, "Hold on, hang on.
”他希望大家都能平安。
He wanted everyone to be safe.
一直在帮忙协调物资的志愿者丹丹生病了，让大象和其他同伴都很揪心。
Dendan, a volunteer who had been helping to coordinate supplies, became ill, leaving the elephant and the others worried.
“她帮了那么多人，我一定要去帮她。
'She has helped so many people, and I must go and help her.
”大象和丹丹此前并不认识，也没有见过面，在特殊时期更不能走近，他带着药和菜去看望丹丹，把物资放在小区的长椅上，就坐回车里等丹丹下楼。
Elephant and Dandan, who had never met or met before, could not get any closer in special times. He took medicine and vegetables to see Dandan, put the supplies on the couch in the neighborhood, and sat back in the car waiting for Dandan to descend.
丹丹没有精神，下楼一趟喘得像一个80多岁的老奶奶。
Dendan had no spirit and went downstairs to pant like an 80-year-old granny.
大象看到虚弱的丹丹，眼泪止不住地流，“有很多熟悉的、不熟悉的人，一个个地离开，这一次真的，大家都很沮丧，而且不知道方向，不知道是不是黎明前的黑暗。
The elephant sees the weak Dandan, tears flow uncontrollably. "There are a lot of familiar, unfamiliar people, leaving one by one. This time really, everyone is very depressed and does not know the direction, do not know whether the dawn before the dark.
”但大象的车轮并没有停下来，他依旧坚持工作，“我想总得有一束光，照亮大家前行的路。
But the elephant's wheels did not stop, and he kept on working. "I think there has to be a beam of light to light the way.
”坚守岗位第2集《这不只是工作》讲述了在疫情时期仍然坚守岗位的普通人，他们是外卖员、开锁师傅、理发师、卡车司机……武汉封城后，外卖员王建工作的站点，只剩下10个人在工作，他接到了一个特殊的订单——帮忙遛狗，狗狗陈皮的主人是孕妇。
"It's not Just Work" tells the story of ordinary people who stayed on the job during the epidemic: takeaway salesmen, locksmith, hairdresser, truck driver... Wuhan Fengcheng, only 10 people remained at work, and he received a special order to walk the dog, whose owner was a pregnant woman.
外卖员送货疫情期间，遛狗也成了危险的活动，王建每天晚上都要去陈皮家里接它出来，遛一圈再送它安全到家，这只金毛犬体型庞大，但性格却非常温顺。
Wang Jian picked him up at Chen Pi's house every night for a walk to take him home safely. The golden retriever was large but very docile.
外卖员徐晶晶也接到了大量的代购订单，她明显地感觉到，自1月20日起，药店的口罩就卖断货了，再往后帮客户买药，也经常需要跑好多家店，才能买齐。
Xu Jingjing, a take-out clerk, has also been flooded with buying orders, and she clearly feels that since Jan. 20, pharmacies have sold out of masks, buying medicines for customers and often running multiple stores to buy them.
让徐晶晶印象深刻的一个订单，来自一位老先生，他需要30毫升的胰岛素，因为他不会用手机下单，辗转了很久才在别人的手机上下了一单，他很着急，徐晶晶只好一边跑单一边安慰这位急需胰岛素的老人。
One of Xu's most impressive orders came from an old gentleman who needed 30 milliliters of insulin because he could not place orders on his cell phone, tossing and turning over a single order on someone else's cell phone. Xu was worried and had to run and comfort the elderly man, who desperately needed insulin.
徐晶晶自从武汉封城后，就一直在外面跑，她感觉疫情让人与人之间的距离变远了，但是心却更近了，“平时大家点外卖图个方便，现在代购了之后，很多顾客一连几次都在找我。
Xu Jingjing, who has been running outside since the end of the city, feels the epidemic is making people distance away from each other, but her heart is closer.
”滞留武汉的猫留在武汉过年的开锁师傅易松山，整个春节期间都非常忙碌，他接到的90%的开锁工作，都是去客户家上门喂猫。
The cat who stayed in Wuhan for the New Year was kept busy throughout the Lunar New Year, and Yi Song Shan, the unlocked master.
他进门之前就会给宠物主人打视频电话，给对方看家里的情况以及猫的现状，他日益娴熟地掌握了铲猫砂和换水、添粮的一整套动作，如果客户家里猫粮不足，他还会带猫粮上门，让嗷嗷待哺的小猫吃个痛快。
He would make video calls to his pet owner before entering the house to show him how the family was doing and how the cat was doing. He was increasingly adept at scooping cat sand and changing water and food.
易松山感慨，很多人看到他的猫之后，伤心的流泪，看到自己救活他的猫，感动的流泪。
Yi Song Shan sigh, many people see his cat, sad tears, to see his cat alive, moved tears.
理发师宋忠桥也在疫情期间挺身而出，为援鄂医疗队的医护人员理发，让他们能安心上一线，救更多的病患。
The barber, Song Zhongqiao, also stepped forward during the epidemic, cutting the hair of medical staff of the medical team in Hubei so that they could relax and save more patients.
疫情时期，理发成为刚需。
During the epidemic, haircuts became just needed.
此前，宋师傅从没想过，理发也会保护医护人员的安全。
Previously, Master Song had never thought that haircuts would also protect the health care workers.
宋师傅温柔地帮助女医护剪掉长发，并把剪下来的长发拿给她们留作纪念，“我想在保护他们的情况下，去帮忙把发型设计好。
"Master Song gently helped the nurses cut their long hair and gave them their long hair as a souvenir." I wanted to help design it while protecting them.
”剪掉长发的女医护们也非常乐观，“换个新发型也挺好。
"The female doctors with long hair cut were also upbeat." A new haircut is good, too.
”不能忘记武汉是一座千万人口的城市，每一个挺身而出的志愿者，都在为武汉能够正常运转，贡献出自己的力量。
"Wuhan can not forget that Wuhan is a city of ten million people, each of the volunteers stood up for the normal operation of Wuhan, to contribute their own strength.
他们对抗病毒，也在对抗自己对病毒的恐惧。
They are both anti-viral and fighting their own fear of the virus.
纪录片《在武汉》记录下了他们每一个人面对疫情时的勇敢、焦虑、恐惧、乐观……大象依然坚持每天运送物资、接送医护人员，他一边开车一边平静地说：“身后就是家人、朋友、乡亲……汶川我都去救助过，现在是在生我养我的城市。
The documentary "In Wuhan" recorded the courage, anxiety, fear and optimism of each of them in the face of the epidemic... Elephants still adhere to the daily delivery of goods and medical personnel, he said quietly as he drove: "behind my family, friends, villagers... I went to Wenchuan to help, is now the birth of my city.
真的牺牲了，也是为自己的家乡，不亏。
Really sacrifice, but also for their hometown, do not lose.
”因为篇幅所限，很多素材并没有进入《在武汉》的正片，作为花絮单独剪辑出来。
Due to space constraints, much of the material did not make it into the Wuhan positive film, which was edited separately as an aftertaste.
其中，从福建三明开车送货到武汉的司机吴国水，令很多网友感动。
Among them, from Fujian Sanming to Wuhan driver Wu Guoshui, so many netizens moved.
他第一趟自费出车到武汉，家人不理解，房东也不要他回去，积蓄也花光了。
He made his first trip to Wuhan at his own expense. His family did not understand him and the landlord didn't want him back.
但是吴国水没有后悔，他觉得做善事就是尽自己的一份力，别人怎么说、怎么看不重要，当他把物资运送到武汉后，拍视频留念时，他也说不要提他的名字，只说武汉加油就好。
But Wu did not regret, he felt that to do good deeds is to do their part, what other people say and how do not matter, when he was transported to Wuhan, take video souvenir, he said not to mention his name, just said Wuhan refueling.
正如主创团队所说的，8集纪录片《在武汉》想要表达的是，“民胞物与，念兹在兹。
As the team said, what the eight-part documentary "In Wuhan" wants to say is, "Citizens and people, read this.
”每一个为抗击疫情做过贡献的人，都不应该被忘记。
No one who has contributed to the fight against the epidemic should be forgotten.
同样，这场疫情带来的反思，也不能被遗忘。
Likewise, the reflection brought about by the epidemic must not be forgotten.
