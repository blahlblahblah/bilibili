On the evening of January 20, Zhong Nan-shan, the head of the high-level group of experts of the National Fitness and Health Commission, said he was certain that the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia was a human-to-human phenomenon.
刘国俊感到事态严重性超出了原本的预期。
Liu Guojun felt the situation was more serious than he had expected.
其实当天上午，刘国俊已召开紧急会议，对小米武汉员工提前放假，封闭办公区，客服全部回家办公，少数必要留守员工要求每天检查体温并做记录。

”刘国俊说。

刘国俊告诉腾讯《潜望》，由于当时武汉的情况已经很严峻，但是部分员工不愿意提前离开，于是团队不得不下达最后的“通牒”，告诉不愿离开的员工，公司即将停水停电，到时室内将没有暖气，才将这些人“赶走”。
The team had to give a final "ultimatum" to employees who were reluctant to leave because Wuhan was already in a serious situation, telling reluctant employees that the company was going to run out of water and electricity and that there would be no heating to drive them away.
与此同时，刘国俊让团队提前购置口罩、体温计等物品，以便春节开工上班以后全员可以使用。
At the same time, Liu Guojun let the team ahead of time to buy masks, thermometers and other items, so that the Spring Festival can be used after the start of work.
但刘国俊当时没有想到，武汉竟然很快就封城了。

不过，放假之后的刘国俊却比平时更忙，因为他还有另外一件紧急而重要的事要做。
However, after the vacation Liu Guojun is busier than usual because he has another urgent and important thing to do.
紧急驰援武汉“我们一定要尽自己的所能，尽快为武汉防疫提供物资”，得知疫情的严重性以后，雷军对同事们说。
"We must do our utmost to provide supplies for epidemic prevention in Wuhan as soon as possible," Lei Jun told his colleagues after learning of the seriousness of the outbreak.
这位毕业于武汉大学的湖北企业家迅速拍板：小米要真心实意帮助武汉人民，在第一阶段筹措超过300万元物资基础上，迅速追加1000万元资金援助。
The Hubei entrepreneur, who graduated from Wuhan University, quickly decided that millet should help the people of Wuhan in good faith and raise more than three million yuan in the first phase, and quickly add 10 million yuan of financial aid.
1月22日，小米有品负责人高自光与质量服务部同事闫明辉等人商量，为武汉抗击疫情做点什么。

经过一上午的核实，有品拥有武汉一线所需的各类产品共1万7千多件。
After a morning of verification, the goods have Wuhan needs a variety of products totalling more than 17, 000 pieces.
库存量看起来并不高，这是因为口罩和温度计在平时并不是热销商品，谁也没有料到疫情产生的需求爆发。
Stocks don't look high, because masks and thermometers are not usually hot commodities, and no one expected the outbreak to erupt.
自1月23日起，雷军的个人微博下方就有不少网友评论称，为何小米商城和小米有品买不到口罩了，雷军未做回应，但实际上，这些口罩都是捐往疫情最严重的武汉了。
Since Jan. 23, many netizens have commented on why millet malls and millet products can't buy masks. Lei Jun has not responded, but in fact, the masks were donated to Wuhan, the worst hit.
