Is for the anti-epidemic diary series 5, from Wuhan after a college teacher infected with the virus cured his own experience, oral content compiled by the deep network.
回顾我的整个经历，我首先想表达的是感激，我想向身边所有帮助、关心过我的各位亲人、同事、同学、朋友以及医护人员表达感激。
Looking back on my entire experience, I would like to express my gratitude first of all. I would like to express my gratitude to all my loved ones, colleagues, classmates, friends and medical personnel who have helped and cared for me.
他们在我最困难的时候，始终都陪在我身边，替我排忧解难。
In my most difficult time, they have always been with me to help me out of trouble.
正是因为这种情感的力量，我才有动力坚持，坚持和疾病作斗争。
It is because of this emotional strength that I have the motivation to persevere, to persevere in the fight against disease.
从咳嗽到警觉在我出现疑似症状前，我有两天在武汉各区之间的出行史。
From coughing to vigilance I had a two-day travel history between districts in Wuhan before I developed suspected symptoms.
1月18日，我带着自己不满3岁的女儿曾经在武汉市区闲逛过，江汉路步行街、司门口、汉口竹叶山二手汽车市场（帮我妹妹买车）。
On January 18, I took my under-three-year-old daughter out on a stroll around Wuhan City, helping my sister buy a car in Hanhan Road, in front of the door and in Hankou's bamboo-leaf mountain second-hand car market.
先后乘坐的公共交通工具有公交车、出租车、轮渡、地铁。
Public transportation by bus, taxi, ferry, subway.
20号之前的武汉，人们忙碌着置办年货，整个城市平常而又喜庆。
Wuhan before the 20th, people busy buying New Year goods, the whole city is normal and festive.
除了少数人以外，大多数人对病毒几乎是不设防的。
With the exception of a few, most people are almost defenseless against the virus.
18号晚间，我和女儿、我的妹妹和外甥，我开着妹妹家的新车一起回到了郊区老家。
In the evening of the 18th, my daughter, my sister and my nephew, I drove back to my hometown together with my sister's new car.
19号上午我又带着女儿从郊区老家辗转回到了位于武昌市区的家中，19号下午我和女儿以及邻居一家人到位于武昌徐东销品茂的沃尔玛购置了年货——这可是一个位于地下一层的大型商超。
On the morning of the 19th, I returned to my home in downtown Wuchang with my daughter. On the afternoon of the 19th I went to Wal-Mart, a store in Xuedong, Jinmao, Wuchang, to buy New Year's Eve.
让我印象极其深刻的是：在这个人头攒动、空气不太流通的超市里，几乎无人戴口罩。
What impressed me most was the fact that few people wore masks in this crowded, poorly ventilated supermarket.
20日下午，我们一家人驱车回到了郊区老家。
On the afternoon of the 20th, our family drove back to their hometown in the suburb.
作者女儿，1月18日摄于武汉当天晚上我开始出现干咳。
The author's daughter, January 18 in Wuhan that night I began to have a dry cough.
我记得很清楚的是，当时我还一直拿着手机关注疫情的进展，并和周边的各类朋友讨关于疫情的各种细节，这种干咳的基本表现就是：没有痰，但嗓子里有明显的异物感，你总想清嗓子把这些异物清理出去，但怎么也清理不掉。
What I remember quite clearly was that I was following the epidemic with my mobile phone and asking my friends around me for details of the epidemic. The basic manifestation of this dry cough was that there was no phlegm, but there was a distinct foreign body in my throat, and you wanted to clear your throat, but you couldn't get it out.
因为出现这种症状，加之自己大量时间集中关注疫情，这天晚上我情绪就开始警觉，并不自觉地胡思乱想。
As a result of this condition, coupled with the fact that I spent a lot of time focusing on the epidemic, I became emotionally alert that evening and began to daydream unconsciously.
一会儿心理暗示自己应该没有感染新冠状病毒，一会又担心自己可能感染上了。
A moment psychological hint oneself should not infect new coronavirus, one moment worry oneself possibly infect.
一整晚难以入眠。
I can't sleep all night.
第二天即1月21号，我开始自觉大量饮水，拿着水杯不停喝水。
The next day, January 21st, I began to drink a lot of water, holding a glass of water.
但干咳的现象并没有实质性的好转，到晚上后，咳嗽动作逐渐频繁。
But the dry cough phenomenon did not substantially improve, after the night, cough action gradually frequent.
为了不影响家人休息，我尽量压低声音并捂着自觉的嘴巴。
In order not to affect the family rest, I try to keep my voice down and cover my conscious mouth.
此时我心里的隐忧进一步加重；与此同时为了给自己信心和安慰，我又开始综合分析自己往常的身体情况和这几天的行程，然后并暗示自己：应该不至于这么倒霉感染上，即使感染上了应该也不怕。
At the same time, in order to give myself confidence and comfort, I began to make a comprehensive analysis of my usual physical condition and my itinerary over the past few days, and then hinted that I should not be so unlucky to get infected, even if infected.
又是一个几乎难眠的夜晚。
It was another almost sleepless night.
到1月22号，我开始出现胸口发闷的症状；同时也出现了吃饭恶心的症状。
By January 22, I began to develop symptoms of chest tightness, as well as nausea at meal times.
此时我自觉与家人保持了距离，但我仍未向家人表明自己的担心，也并无告知他们我现在身体的不舒服症状。
I felt like I was distancing myself from my family, but I still didn't share my concerns with my family, nor did I tell them of my unwell condition.
家里的氛围仍然围绕在过一个团圆喜庆的春节上——我不想惊扰他们。
The atmosphere around the home is still around a reunion festive Spring Festival - I do not want to disturb them.
但是我自己的身体状况只有我最清楚，我越来越感觉情况不妙。
But my own health is only as clear as mine, and I feel increasingly ill.
加之持续性的关注微信上的消息，不断和人讨论关于疫情的各种问题。
Coupled with persistent concerns about the message on the message, and people continue to discuss the epidemic on a variety of issues.
特别是看到各种流传自医护人员、周边亲朋好友的所谓“一线情景”。
In particular, see a variety of spread from the medical staff, friends and relatives around the so-called "first-line scenario."
我几乎一天都是在提心吊胆中度过的。
I spent almost a day in fear.
晚上睡觉的时候，整个人那更是一边进行自我的思想斗争，一边在脑海里放映各种关于疫情的情节。
At night, when sleeping, the whole person is engaged in self-struggle, while in the mind to show a variety of scenarios about the epidemic.
我又是在惊恐万分的情绪中熬过了一整晚。
I stayed out the whole night in a state of panic.
1月23日，一早醒来。
Wake up early on January 23rd.
我坦诚地和家人说出了自己的身体症状以及自己内心的担忧。
I spoke frankly to my family about my physical symptoms and my inner fears.
家人还责怪我大惊小怪，他们觉得：这事怎么可能发生在我们家身上呢！但是我极力告诉他们，为了全家人的健康，也为了对自己负责，我必须去医院检查一下。
My family blamed me for the fuss and they thought how it could have happened to my family, but I tried to tell them that I had to go to the hospital for my family's health and my own responsibility.
于是这天上午我驱车来到郊区城关的人民医院。
So this morning I drove to the people's hospital in the suburb gate.
在向导医台询问相关情况后，我被告知要去呼吸科就诊。
After inquiring about the situation at the guide, I was told to go to the respiratory department.
简单办理相关手续后，我来到医院的呼吸科。
After the simple formalities, I came to the respiratory department of the hospital.
根据叫号机的叫号，上午呼吸科大概有200多号人就诊。
According to the caller's call, there are about 200 people in the respiratory department in the morning.
值班护士叫我下午再去，上午肯定排不上了。
The nurse on duty told me to go again in the afternoon. I couldn't make it in the morning.
于是我离开医院，到附近的超市再次购置了一些生活物资；然后开车回家。
So I left the hospital and went to a nearby supermarket to buy some more supplies. Then I drove home.
下午一点半我又准时来到医院，呼吸科仍然排着长龙。
At half past one I arrived at the hospital on time and the respiratory department was still standing in line.
医院两点整上班后，我赶紧去拿号——此时已经有64人在我前面。
After the hospital started work at two o'clock sharp, I hurried to get the number - there were already 64 in front of me.
整个下午我就在等待、焦虑中穿梭于医院。
I spent the afternoon waiting, worrying and shuttling through the hospital.
等我看完医生、拍完ct之后，已经是近下午6点了。
It was almost 6 p. m., after I had seen the doctor and filmed ct.
医生的初步诊断结果是：低热，排除流感，肺部正常，支气管发炎。
The doctor's initial diagnosis was: low fever, rule out flu, normal lungs and inflamed bronchi.
由于得知肺部没有被感染，人的心情放松多了。
People are more relaxed when they learn that the lungs are not infected.
回家后，早早吃过晚饭，然后早早便休息了。
After coming home, we had supper early and then we had an early rest.
尽管如此，这一天睡眠质量仍旧很差。
Nevertheless, the quality of sleep continued to be poor that day.
1月24号，除夕。
January 24th, New Year's Eve.
上午醒来，整个人感觉不错。
Wake up in the morning and feel good.
和家人一起忙碌、一起准备团年饭。
Get busy with your family and get ready for the Lunar New Year.
吃过团年饭，陪着孩子一起玩耍。
After the Lunar New Year dinner, accompany the children to play together.
一切都看起来会恢复正常。
Everything seems to be back to normal.
大概在下午三点左右的样子，人又开始不舒服。
About three o'clock in the afternoon, people began to feel uncomfortable again.
主要表现就是乏力、想躺着；然后胸口再次憋闷——而且憋闷感比之前都要重。
The main performance is weak, want to lie down; then the chest again suffocate - and suffocate feeling heavier than before.
到晚间的时候，胸口已经开始疼痛，全身发汗并出现低烧（37.5）。
By the evening, chest pain had begun and the body was sweating and suffering from a low fever (37.5).
此时我再次意识到情况可能真的不妙，我果断地和家人分析了一些目前的局面以及自己的身体状况，我告诉他们：我现在必须和大家隔离，我一个人回武昌的家中。
Once again I realized that the situation might be really bad. I decidedly analyzed the current situation and my health with my family. I told them that I had to isolate myself and go back to my home in Wuchang.
此时家人可能也意识到了问题的严重性，他们虽然不舍但依然支持我的决定。
At this point the family may also be aware of the seriousness of the problem, although they reluctantly support my decision.
于是我快马加鞭，通过各种小路，一个人驱车回到了武昌的家中。
So I quickly horsewhip, through various paths, a man drove back to Wuchang's home.
开车期间我有过非常明显的胸痛感、窒息感。
During the driving period, I had a very clear feeling of chest pain and suffocation.
回到家中大概已经是十点左右了。
It was about ten o'clock at home.
我立马和周边能联系的人进行了联系沟通——包括社区、校医院、学院院办。
I immediately made contact with people around me - including the community, the school hospital, the college.
我当时提出能否尽快找一个医院进行详细的入院治疗。
I asked if it would be possible to find a hospital for detailed hospitalization as soon as possible.
尽管大家非常热心地联络和协调。
Although there was a great deal of enthusiasm for liaison and coordination.
但是当时的武汉入院床位紧张，在仔细参考医院医生等的意见后，我决定在家居家隔离。
But Wuhan hospital bed at that time, after careful reference to the advice of hospital doctors, I decided to stay at home isolation.
隔离和入院1月25日，大年初一。
Isolation and admission January 25, the first day of the New Year.
我一个人在武昌家中，顿时感觉很迷茫无助，体现在两个方面：身体症状一直在持续并有加重的趋势；第二个就是自己无法准确判断我现在到底是感染了没有、如果感染，感染进展到哪一步，我又该如何做？好在通过微信朋友圈，我获得了朋友们大量的建议和相关信息。
When I was alone in Wuchang, I felt at a loss and helplessness. The second was that I could not accurately determine whether I was infected, if infected, how far I should go.
我也逐一阅读并开始有针对性地实践。
I also read them one by one and began to practice them specifically.
期间我开始针对性地记录自己的身体状态。
During this time I began to record my physical state in a targeted way.
这一天，几乎之前所有的症状都存在，并且还多了一个症状就是——腹胀，非常难受的腹胀。
This day, almost all the previous symptoms exist, and there is an additional symptom - abdominal distension, very uncomfortable abdominal distension.
想大便但是大便不出的那种感觉。
The feeling of having a stool but not a stool.
到晚间的时候，体温也开始升到了39度。
By evening, the body temperature began to rise to 39 degrees.
大概十点多，开始盗汗、呼气吸气费劲——总想深呼吸。
Around ten o'clock, I start sweating and exhaling. I always want to take a deep breath.
我开始恐慌。
I began to panic.
躺在床上就不断重复一个念头：我能治好吗？我会不会把全家人都感染？我该怎么办？在单位同事和领导的帮忙下，我终于通过一辆救护车被送进了武昌区一个刚刚被征用为发热病人定点收治医院的医院内，在顺利完成入院手续后，我住进了该医院的隔离病房。
As I lay in bed, I kept repeating the same idea: Can I be cured? Will I infect the whole family? What can I do? With the help of my colleagues and leaders, I was finally sent to a hospital in Wuchang District that had just been requisitioned as a designated hospital for febrile patients.
住进隔离病房后，医生和护士就来为我进行了各种基本的身体检查和问诊。
After I was admitted to the isolation ward, the doctors and nurses came to perform various basic physical examinations and consultations for me.
然后为我抽血、打针，并为我开了两盒抗病毒的药物——我记得很清楚是切诺和奥司他韦。
Then I took blood, gave me shots, and prescribed two boxes of antiviral drugs - Cheroo and oseltamivir, I remember very well.
身边有医生护士，在医院的这一晚我是最为安心的，吃过药之后大概12点，我放下手机，开始睡觉。
There were doctors and nurses, I was the most at ease this night in the hospital, after taking medicine about 12 o'clock, I put down my cell phone and began to sleep.
这一晚睡得很好。
This one slept very well.
1月26日。
January 26.
早上起来，感觉人精神了不少。
Wake up in the morning, feeling a lot of spirit.
然后拿起手机不停和周边的亲朋好友报平安。
Then picked up the phone and around the friends and relatives to report peace.
玩着手机几乎停不下来，这个时候我竟然忘了吃饭，也忘了吃药。
I could hardly stop playing with my cell phone. At this time, I forgot to eat or take medicine.
直到下午两点多，我感觉有点饿，并且身体又开始不舒服，我才意识到应该停下来休息休息了。
By 2: 00 pm, I felt a little hungry and began to feel sick again. I realized that I should stop and rest.
于是我躺在床上静养。
So I lay still in bed.
大概在四点多的时候，我胸口的疼痛达到了出现症状以来的恶化地步，我能明显感觉到整个腹部在急剧收缩，接着就是只能吸气，呼气几乎呼不出来。
At about four o'clock, the pain in my chest grew to the point where I had symptoms, and I could feel a sharp contraction of my whole abdomen, followed by an inhale that barely exhaled.
到某个时刻，吸气也几乎停滞。
At some point, the inhalation almost comes to a standstill.
我能感觉到整个身体已经停止工作。
I could feel my whole body stop working.
但此时我的意识非常清醒，我努力睁着眼睛告诉自己不能睡，不能闭眼。
But at this time my consciousness is very clear, I try to open their eyes to tell themselves not to sleep, can not close their eyes.
然后我的手死死拽着床单，身上不停淌汗。
Then my hands were clinging to the sheets, sweating incessantly.
大概一分多钟后，我感觉自己熬过来了，呼吸开始逐渐恢复。
After about a minute or so, I felt myself through and began to breathe again.
然后身体里也发生了很多奇妙的变化——我能感觉到身体里有一股力量在运行，似乎是一股努力要打败病毒的力量。
Then there were many wonderful changes in my body - I could feel a force running in my body, as if it were a force trying to defeat the virus.
这种状况一直持续到晚上，然后整个晚上我并没有入睡。
It lasted until night, and then I didn't fall asleep the whole night.
我感受着自己身体的变化，因为我此时并不明白自己的身体里到底发生了什么，我是否已经安全；我如果闭眼睡觉，是否有危险等等。
I felt my body changing because I didn't know what was going on in my body, whether I was safe, if I slept with my eyes closed, whether I was in danger, etc.
1月27日。
January 27.
睁着眼睛到天亮。
Open your eyes until morning.
我感到极度的疲倦和饥饿。
I feel extremely tired and hungry.
我让家人赶紧做了一些好吃的给我送过来。
I asked my family to make some delicious food and send it to me.
这一天我一直在吃东西、流汗中渡过。
I spent the day eating and sweating.
我仍然非常担心，因为我仍然不太清楚自己的身体状况发展到哪一步了。
I'm still very worried because I'm still not sure where I'm going.
大概在上午11点左右的时候，我又发了一次高烧、全身被汗水浸透，然后意识似乎陷入了模糊之中——一直在做梦，做各种奇怪的梦。
Around 11 a.m., I had another high fever, sweaty all over my body, and then my consciousness seemed to be in a blur - dreaming, dreaming strange dreams.
直到12点左右，我醒来。
Until about twelve o'clock, I woke up.
醒来后，我感觉到身体似乎在恢复——此时特别饿。
When I woke up, I felt as if I was recovering - especially hungry.
然后赶紧把家人带过来的东西，能吃的都吃了，吃的特别胀。
Then hurriedly bring over the family things, can eat all the food, eat special bulge.
吃完东西，和身边的人报了平安。
After eating, and the people around the report of peace.
因为在我高烧期间，我发了很多莫名其妙的言论在朋友圈；搅得朋友圈里所有关心我的朋友，尤其是身边的至亲们，担惊受怕不已。
Because during my fever I made a lot of inexplicable remarks in my circle of friends, which alarmed all the friends in the circle of friends who cared about me, especially my closest relatives.
在告诉大家我平安之后，我又躺下来静养。
After telling everyone I was safe, I lay down again to rest.
一直到晚间，我吃了饭，努力撑着上了厕所，然后回到病床继续休息。
Until late evening, I ate, tried to support the toilet, and then returned to the bed to continue to rest.
这期间我告诉医生，我想做一次肺部的ct检查。
Meanwhile, I told my doctor that I wanted to have a CT scan of my lungs.
自从我25号入院以来，医生和护士对我进行各种常规的检查，测体温、量血压、测血氧饱和度等等；这个医院刚刚被改为定点收治医院，医院在进行科室调整和人员调整，所以整个医院非常忙；中途我和医生反映过自己的不舒服，医生一直告诉我，我的情况还好。
Since I was admitted to hospital No. 25, doctors and nurses have carried out various routine tests to measure body temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, etc. The hospital has just been converted into a designated hospital, which is undergoing readjustment and staff adjustment, so the hospital is very busy.
晚上八点左右，我去做了检查。
I went for an examination at about eight in the evening.
医生拿到片子后说问题不大——仅有双肺纹理增多的现象，很快就可以出院回家休息。
Doctors got the picture and said it wasn't a big deal -- only two-lung textures were on the increase and could soon be released from the hospital for a rest.
反思和总结回顾我的整个经历，我首先想表达的是感激，正是因为家人、同事、朋友这种情感的力量，我才有动力坚持，坚持和疾病作斗争。
Reflecting and summarizing my experience, I would like to express my gratitude first of all. It is because of the emotional strength of my family, colleagues and friends that I have the motivation to persevere and persevere in the struggle against disease.
我想和朋友们分享的第二点反思是：不论你有没有确定感染这个病毒，大家一定首先要平和自己的心态；如果病魔是四分的话，心魔是六分。
The second point I would like to share with my friends is that, whether you are sure you are infected with the virus or not, you must first calm your mind.
尤其是对于我们这个30-40岁阶段的人来说，由于我们上有老下有小，所以在面对这种未知疾病时，我们容易背负沉重的心理负担。
Especially for those of us in the 30-40 age group, we are prone to bear a heavy psychological burden in the face of this unknown disease as we grow old and young.
一旦我们背负了过重的心理负担，我们的免疫机制可能会受到影响，于此我们的身体就会陷入一种恶性循环之中，也不利于我们抗击病毒。
Once we are overburdened, our immune system may be affected, and our bodies become trapped in a vicious circle that is not conducive to the fight against the virus.
第三点是比较具体的反思：不要过分集中精力关注疫情和与病毒有关的信息，不要在身体出现任何轻微的不适时作心理暗示——仔细对照该病毒引起的症状逐一对应。
The third point is a more specific reflection: don't focus too much on the epidemic and virus-related information, and don't give any slight psychological cues to the body - carefully contrast the symptoms caused by the virus.
不要长时间玩手机。
Don't play with your phone for long.
要调整生活节奏，尤其是要保证良好的睡眠。
To adjust the pace of life, especially to ensure a good sleep.
紧着第四点：如果你的不适症状在增多并且持续加重，你应当尽早考虑去医院进行检查，如果条件容许，你最好进行确诊。
Hold on to the fourth point: If your symptoms are increasing and getting worse, you should consider going to the hospital for an examination as early as possible. If conditions permit, you'd better make a diagnosis.
当然现在整个武汉市的现状是：医疗资源紧张、医护人员超负荷工作；你需要在自己的身体状况和现实情景之间权衡。
Now, of course, the situation in Wuhan is as follows: medical resources are tight, medical staff are overworked; you need to balance your physical condition with the reality of the situation.
一旦你的身体发出了某些明显的信号——比如发烧、高热、呼吸急促等。
Once your body sends out some obvious signals like fever, high fever, shortness of breath, etc.
那么你应该想办法及时就医。
Then you should find a way to see a doctor.
与此同时，也是极为重要的注意事项：和家人彻底隔离。
At the same time, it is an extremely important caveat: complete separation from your family.
第五点：这个病毒的感染，从目前官方数据来看，客观来说它的不友好主要集中在老年人以及存在基础性重大疾病或者免疫系统有缺陷的这三类人群，他们容易出现重症或者危重症甚至死亡。
The fifth point: The official figures so far indicate that the virus's unfriendliness is concentrated on the elderly and those three groups with major underlying diseases or immune system defects, who are vulnerable to serious or critical illness and even death.
对于不属于以上群体的人群，感染症状会比较轻微。
For those who do not belong to the above groups, the symptoms of infection are relatively mild.
只要你注意生活卫生并加强身体的免疫能力，你完全可能自愈。
As long as you pay attention to the health of life and strengthen the body's immunity, you may well heal yourself.
我的上述总结当然只是就“一般情况”而言的，而且每个人的身体条件或者感染情况差异极大，因此我们一定要具体问题具体分析。
My summary is, of course, only "general," and each person's physical condition or infection is highly variable, so we must analyze the specific problem.
第六：不论是不是为了抗击这一次的病毒，我们普通人在以后的生活中都应该注意个人卫生和公共卫生：勤洗手、必要时戴口罩、勤消毒通风；不要食用野生动物等等。
Sixth: Whether to fight the virus this time, we ordinary people should pay attention to personal hygiene and sanitation later in life: wash hands frequently, wear masks when necessary, disinfect ventilation, do not eat wild animals and so on.
希望这一次的疫情对于我们普通人来说，是一次“卫生”启蒙。
Hopefully this outbreak will be a "sanitary" enlightenment for us ordinary people.
最后：我所热爱的城市和家乡已经陷入某种“非正常”状态很久了，这里的人们都经历了或者正在经历着人生中可能最为煎熬、最为特殊的历史时期。
Finally: My beloved city and hometown have been in a state of "abnormality" for a long time, where people have experienced, or are experiencing, perhaps the most painful and peculiar period of their lives.
他们不仅在身体上承受着极端的压力，他们在心理上同样承受着无比巨大的压力。
Not only are they under extreme physical stress, but they are also psychologically under enormous stress.
所有这一切，都来得太过突然，太过沉重。
All this came too suddenly, too heavily.
希望大家能尽量保持宽容和理性。
I hope you will try to be tolerant and rational.
请支持他们，请关爱他们。
Please support them and care for them.
