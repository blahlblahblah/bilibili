但我理发十多年了，却从没有碰到年轻女士要求给自己剃光头的。
But I've had a haircut for more than a decade and never met a young woman asking to shave her head.
前天晚上我在汉口维也纳酒店大堂为河北医疗队队员理发时，一位长发到腰的姐姐一坐上凳子就告诉我：‘要理光头！’”“当时我以为自己听错了！”文彬告诉记者。
I was in the lobby of the Hankou Vienna Hotel the night before yesterday for a haircut by a member of the Hebei Medical Team, when a sister with long hair down to her waist sat down on a stool and told me, 'I thought I was hearing you wrong!' "Wen Bin told reporters.
“当我拿起剪刀，捋起她乌黑光滑的长发时，再一次问她，‘确定光头吗？’那位姐姐犹豫片刻后抽泣地说：‘光头！’当时，我禁不住眼圈泛红，被这位姐姐的举动所感染。
"When I picked up the scissors and tucked up her long black hair, I asked her again, 'Sure of my bald head?' The sister sobbed after a moment's hesitation.

Which girls do not love beauty, and what beautiful girls do not want to have a long flowing hair, women's hair is waist to waist, shoulder to shoulder, the shortest is the same ear.

当李冉先将这位女医护人员的长发剪到齐耳，准备动推剪在她头上推第一剪时，那位女孩落泪了。
When Li Ran first cut the long hair of the paramedic to Qi Er, ready to move it to push the first cut on her head, the girl burst into tears.
“我没见过这样的场景，挺佩服这位姐姐的勇气。
"I have never seen such a scene and quite admire the courage of this sister.
那一刻，我似乎觉得自己一下长大了，对人生有了更深的感悟！”李冉告诉记者。

They drove to the hotel from six in the afternoon, working nonstop until 12: 00 in the evening, and each of them could manage between 20 and 30 people.
“我们把酒店大堂当作理发厅，有些酒店大堂没有镜子，我们就对着大堂玻璃门当镜子，战时状态嘛。
"We use the lobby as a barber shop. Some hotel lobbies don't have mirrors, and we use the glass doors in the lobby as mirrors.

Wen Bin and Li Ran used to work in a trendy hairdressing shop, mostly frequented by young people. The price of regular haircuts is between RMB150 and RMB280.
“同样是理发，义务做好事和日常营业收费的感觉是不一样的。
"" It's the same haircut that feels different when it comes to volunteering for a good deed or running a business.
为千里迢迢来援汉的医护人员免费理发，我们更有成就感。

This is also our national anti-' epidemic 'of a love.
