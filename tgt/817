澎湃新闻记者 卫佳铭“药到了，我的儿子不会死了，我要好好照顾他。
"Here comes the medicine. My son will not die. I will take good care of him.
”2月9日，癫痫病孩妈妈谢晓英告诉澎湃新闻（www.thepaper.cn）。
On February 9, Xie Xiaoying, mother of an epileptic child, told the roaring news (www.thepper.cn).
这一天，她终于在湖北汉川市回龙镇镇上的快递点收到了一个特殊的包裹，里面是病友们从安徽和湖南代买、再通过邮政快递寄来的7瓶药物。
That day, she finally received a special parcel at the express delivery point in Huilongzhen town of Hanchuan, Hubei Province, containing seven bottles of medicine bought by her sick friends from Anhui and Hunan and sent by courier.
二十天前，谢晓英带着5岁的儿子聪聪从湖南长沙回湖北孝感汉川市老家过年。
Twenty days ago, Xie and her five-year-old son Congcong returned from Changsha, Hunan, to celebrate the Spring Festival in their hometown of Hanchuan, Hunan Province.
她没想到，小小的汉川市回龙镇会成为她走不出去的“城”。
She did not expect that the small town of Hanchuan back to Long Town will become she can not go out of the "city."
聪聪两岁时被诊断出癫痫，需要每日两次服用两种药物来控制病情。
Congcong was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was two years old and needed to take two drugs twice a day to control his condition.
出门前，谢晓英已为儿子预备了近一个月的药。
Before going out, Xie Xiaoying had prepared the medicine for her son for nearly a month.
然而，让她猝不及防的是，1月23日，因新冠肺炎疫情，武汉“封城”，一天后，孝感也全面“封城”。
However, she was caught off guard on January 23, due to the new crown pneumonia, Wuhan "closed the city," a day later, filial piety is also "closed.
癫痫宝宝日常服用药物。
Epilepsy baby daily take medicine.
受访者供图望着药瓶里逐日减少的药片，谢晓英开始睡不着觉了。
Xie began to lose sleep as respondents looked at the dwindling number of tablets in the bottle.
停药，意味着生命的危险。
Stop taking medicine, it means life is in danger.
谢晓英跑遍了回龙镇也买不到治疗癫痫的药物，镇政府的工作人员劝她“再撑一下”。
Xie Xiaoying ran back to Long Town can not buy drugs to treat epilepsy, the town government staff advised her to "stick it out."
“不想拿儿子的命来撑”，她想到自驾回湖南取药，“试了两次，每次都被执法人员拦下”。
"Do not want to take his life to support," she thought of driving back to Hunan to get medicine, "tried twice, each time stopped by law enforcement officers."
情急之下，谢晓英通过网络发出了求助，她发现，自己的遭遇并非孤例。
In case of emergency, Xie Xiaoxing sent out help through the network, she found that her experience is not alone.
2月6日，身在上海的癫痫病孩妈妈花妈看到了网络上病友们的求援，她和其余3名志愿者一起，搭建起临时的湖北省内癫痫宝宝药物求助群，为困境中的湖北病孩父母寻求药物和物流渠道。
Feb. 6, the mother of epilepsy children in Shanghai saw the network of patients asked for help, she and the other three volunteers, set up a temporary epileptic baby drug help group in Hubei Province, to seek medicine and logistics channels for parents of sick children in Hubei Province.
短短4天，群里已经聚集了上百名来自随州、孝感、黄石、武汉等12个地区的癫痫宝宝家长。
In just four days, the group has gathered hundreds of parents from 12 regions, including Suizhou, filial piety, Huang Shi and Wuhan.
新华社2月8日报道，国务院办公厅日前印发《关于做好公路交通保通保畅工作确保人员车辆正常通行的通知》（以下简称：《通知》），要求做好公路交通保通保畅工作，确保人员车辆正常通行。
The General Office of the State Council has issued the Notice on Ensuring the Normal Passage of Personnel and Vehicles to Ensure Normal Passage of Road Traffic (hereinafter referred to as "the Notice"), calling for the smooth maintenance of road traffic and ensuring the normal passage of people and vehicles.
巧的是，第二天，谢晓英在快递点收到了病友们帮儿子代买的药。
Coincidentally, the next day, Xie Xiaoying at the express delivery point to help his son buy medicine.
2月9日，谢晓英收到来自安徽和湖南的两个包裹，里面装着她等待已久的7瓶癫痫药物。
On February 9, Xie received two parcels from Anhui and Hunan containing seven bottles of epileptic drugs she had been waiting for.
受访者供图“封城”后买不到的药和回不去的家距离2020年农历新年还有一周时，汉川的家人就开始催谢晓英回家。
Hanchuan's family is urging Xie to return home a week before the 2020 Lunar New Year, when the drugs the respondents couldn't buy and the homes they couldn't get back to.
那时，已有疫情消息传出，与长辈沟通无果后，她硬着头皮回去了。
At that time, there was news of the epidemic, and after communication with the elders failed, she went back bravely.
出发前，她给患有癫痫的儿子聪聪备上了够近一个月的德巴金丙戊酸钠口服溶液和妥泰托吡酯片，她以为，这些药足以支撑到他们回家。
Before leaving, she prepared her epileptic son, Cong Cong, with an oral solution of sodium debajn valproate and topiramate tablets nearly a month ago, which she thought would be sufficient to support their return home.
岂料，疫情愈演愈烈，1月23日，武汉“封城”了。
Unexpectedly, the epidemic intensified, January 23, Wuhan "closed the city."
一天后，谢晓英所在的孝感市新冠肺炎防控指挥部发布5号令：高铁站、城铁站、火车站离开孝感市辖区通道暂时关闭；孝感市辖区内公交、班线客运、农村客运、旅游包车、农村客运渡口、网约车暂停运营。
A day later, Xie Xiaoying's Xiaogan City New Crown Pneumonia Control Command issued 5: high-speed rail station, city railway station, railway station left Xiaogan City area temporarily closed; Xiaogan City area public transport, liner passenger transport, rural passenger transport, tour charter, rural passenger ferry, network cars suspended operation.
谢晓英感觉自己被困住了，她的焦虑来自儿子的病。
Xie felt trapped. Her anxiety came from her son's illness.
聪聪在两岁时被诊断出癫痫，三年来一直依赖药物维持。
Cong was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of two and has been dependent on drugs for three years.
癫痫，俗称“羊癫风”，发病时患者会突然意识丧失，出现吐白沫、肌肉强直性收缩等症状。
Epilepsy, commonly known as "epilepsy," when the patient will suddenly lose consciousness, vomit foam, muscle tonic contraction and other symptoms.
目前，癫痫的治疗手段主要是药物。
At present, the treatment of epilepsy is mainly drugs.
患者在服药期间如果无故减药、断药，极易导致癫痫症状复发。
If the patient takes the medicine without reason reduces the medicine, disables the medicine, causes the epilepsy symptom to recur extremely easily.
然而，许多抗癫痫药物属于治疗神经类精神疾病的药品，购买相对困难。
However, many antiepileptic drugs are part of the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and are relatively difficult to purchase.
谢晓英看着药瓶里的药，每天数，每天少，这令她焦虑到失眠。
Xie Xiaoying looked at the medicine in the bottle and counted it daily, which made her restless to insomnia.
她去镇上找药，却发现镇上连个像样的药店都没有。
She went to town looking for medicine only to find that there was not even a decent pharmacy in the town.
随后，谢晓英又找到回龙镇政府工作人员求助，此前她从不愿公开儿子病情，此时亦顾不上面子，可对方安慰她说，请她再撑一下。
Later, Xie went back to the town government staff for help, before she never want to make her son's illness public, this time without face, but the other side comforted her, asked her to hold on.
“要拿儿子的命去撑吗？”谢晓英不服，她又拨通了市长热线的电话，对方回复她，有特殊情况可找镇里开具书面证明。
"Want to take the son's life to support?" Xie Xiaoying disagrees, she dialed the mayor's hotline, the other side replied to her, there are special circumstances can ask the town to issue a written certificate.
2月3日，谢晓英让年后要回湖南工作的丈夫去镇上打了复工证明，同时把聪聪的情况一并说明。
On February 3, Xie asked her husband, who was returning to Hunan province to work after a year, to return to work in the town to obtain a certificate of return to work.
然而，拿到手里的证明中，却没有聪聪的病情。
However, in getting the certificate in hand, there was no sign of deafness.
2月4日，谢晓英一家三口带着证明踏上了回湘路。
On February 4, Xie Xiaoxing's family set out on the road back to Xiang with their certificates.
然而，车子还没驶出回龙镇，谢晓英和丈夫就被拦下了。
However, before the car left Longtown, Xie and her husband were stopped.
焦急万分，谢晓英哭着拿出聪聪的药罐给执勤民警看，证明自己没有骗人。
Anxious, Xie Xiaoying cried out a smart medicine can to the police on duty to show that they are not deceptive.
最终，因为证明内容不全，谢晓英一家被劝回了。
In the end, the family was persuaded to return because the content of the certificate was incomplete.
回去后，谢晓英丈夫又到镇政府重新打了一份证明。
Back home, Xie Xiaoying's husband went to the town government to make a new certificate.
一天后的2月5日清晨，一家三口再次出发，“当时我想，如果实在去不了湖南就去近一点的武汉。
One day later, in the early morning of February 5, a family of three set out again. "I thought if I could not really get to Hunan, I would go to Wuhan, a little bit closer.
”但他们还是被拦下了。
But they were stopped.
“最开始是准备上高速，结果挡了两辆货车，把路堵死了，没办法只能绕道，绕到另一个镇也不行，我们又开过了几个村，眼看到快到高速囗，又被拦了。
"At first we were getting ready for the freeway, so we blocked two lorries, we couldn't make the detour to another town, and we drove through a few more villages until we came to the top of the highway and was stopped.
”谢晓英告诉澎湃新闻，执法人员将她口头批评了一顿便劝回了，“说我们不听话，非要出市。
"Xie told the stormy news that law enforcement officials had verbally criticized her and then" said we are disobedient and must go out of the market.
”2月9日，谢晓英收到来自安徽和湖南的两个包裹，里面装着她等待已久的7瓶癫痫药物。
On February 9, Xie received two parcels from Anhui and Hunan containing seven bottles of epileptic drugs she had been waiting for.
受访者供图尚未畅通的物流和有门槛的进口药无奈之下，谢晓英转向网络求援。
Interviewees for the graph is not smooth logistics and threshold of import medicine helpless, Xie Xiaoying turned to the network for help.
虚拟的网络空间里，和她一样“为药疯狂”的家长聚集在了一起。
In virtual cyberspace, parents like her, who are "drug-mad," gather together.
澎湃新闻了解到，截至1月24日，湖北省内，共有武汉、鄂州、仙桃、枝江、潜江、黄冈、赤壁、荆门、咸宁、黄石(含大冶市、阳新县)、当阳、恩施、孝感13个地区“封城”。
As of January 24, Wuhan, Hubei, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Huanggang, Red Cliff, Jingmen, Xianning, Huang Shi (including Daye City, Yangxin County), Dang Yang, Enshi and Xiaogan were "closed" in 13 areas in Hubei Province.
相比谢晓英，湖北随州的航航妈妈遭遇的麻烦更为棘手。
Compared with Xie Xiaoying, Hubei Suizhou navigation mother encountered more difficult problems.
航航今年5岁，长期服用德巴金、妥泰、奥卡西平曲莱和喜保宁四种药物，其中喜保宁（SABRIL）是进口药，国内很难购买，她每次都要托人从台湾代购，每盒100片，定价760元。
The five-year-old airline, which uses Depakin, Tootai, Occidental Trillae and Xi Baoxing, is an imported drug that is difficult to purchase at home. She has to send someone to buy 100 tablets a time from Taiwan for 760 yuan.
航航妈妈告诉澎湃新闻，她是1月16日带着儿子从武汉回随州过年的，本以为很快能回家，就没带太多药。
Her mother told Pai Pai News that she had taken her son back to Suizhou from Wuhan on January 16 to celebrate the New Year.
航航妈妈说，目前普通快递进不了湖北，靠省外寄送药物只能靠邮政快递，但邮政快递邮寄药品需要查验药品的发票，而她托人代购的喜保宁大多没有发票可以提供。
Shipping mothers said that at present ordinary couriers can not enter Hubei, rely on the provincial delivery of drugs can only be sent by courier, but postal delivery of medicines need to check invoices for drugs, she said, most of which she had sent to buy without invoices.
目前，航航的喜保宁只剩下十天的量了，武汉的家里仍有存货，但却无法取，也寄不回。
At present, the voyage of Xi BaoNing only 10 days left, Wuhan home is still in stock, but it can not be taken, nor sent back.
找药的日子里，航航妈妈曾在网上找到一名山东的病友，恳请对方代买药物后即送到随州，但又因收件地在湖北，且适逢新年假期，快递公司未能寄出，目前快件仍积压在发货地，没有发出。
On the day of seeking medicine, the mother of the sailing ship found a sick friend in Shandong and begged him to send it to Suizhou where he would buy the medicine. However, since the place of receipt was in Hubei Province and it coincided with the New Year holidays, the express delivery company could not send it.
除了物流上的阻碍之外，一些癫痫患儿所需的药物还需要更复杂的购买门槛。
In addition to logistical hurdles, some children with epilepsy need drugs that require more complex purchase thresholds.
湖北襄阳的罗丹告诉澎湃新闻，她儿子壮壮今年3岁半，除了早晚服用德巴金和妥泰外，还需要服用硝西泮片。
Rodin of Xiangyang, Hubei province, told the roar news that her son, who was three-and-a-half years old, would need to take nitroxepam tablets in addition to the morning and evening meals.
硝西泮片属于接受特殊管理的二类精神药品，需要去医院开处方，但现在隔离期连村都出不了，更别提去医院，“之前没有疫情的时候，也只有在武汉能开得到。
Nitroxepam tablets, which are under special control as a secondary psychotropic substance and require a prescription from a hospital, are not available even in villages, let alone hospitals. "Before the outbreak, it was only available in Wuhan.
”罗丹说，如果没有硝西泮片，壮壮癫痫发作时的反应会特别大，暂时也没有可以替代的药，望着村口的严格把守，她心急如焚。
Rodin said that if there were no nitrositepam tablets, the response to a strong seizure would be particularly large, temporarily there is no alternative medicine, looking at the village mouth of the strict guard, she was burning.
新华社2月8日发文称，国务院办公厅印发《通知》，就进一步做好公路交通保通保畅工作，确保人员车辆正常通行，切实维护经济社会正常秩序作出专门部署。
Xinhua News Agency said on February 8 that the State Council issued a notice to further improve road traffic safety, ensure the normal movement of people and vehicles, and ensure the normal economic and social order to make special arrangements.
要求有序恢复公路运输服务和切实做好应急物资运输。
Requires the orderly restoration of road transport services and the effective transportation of emergency supplies.
严禁阻断国省干线公路，严禁硬隔离或挖断农村公路。
It is strictly forbidden to interdict the main highway in Guizhou province or to isolate or cut off rural roads.
要加强交通疏导，防止发生长时间、长距离公路交通拥堵，确保应急车道畅通。
To strengthen traffic diversion, prevent long-term, long-distance road traffic congestion, ensure the smooth flow of emergency lanes.
各地区、各有关部门要突出重点，优先保障湖北省特别是武汉市的各类应急运输，优先保障疫情防控物资、生活必需物资运输。
All regions and departments concerned should give high priority to ensuring all types of emergency transportation in Hubei province, especially Wuhan, and prioritize the transportation of materials for disease prevention and control, as well as essential goods.
上海癫痫儿童母亲发起的救助2月6日，上海的癫痫儿童母亲花妈在网上留意到了湖北地区癫痫宝宝缺药的情况，她接连在微博呼吁，同时为有买药需求的家庭建立起名为“湖北宝宝，加油！”微信群。
A mother of epileptic children in Shanghai noticed a shortage of drugs among epileptic babies in Hubei province on the Internet on Feb. 6. She continued to call for Weibo and set up the "Hubei Baby, Come on!" micro-faith group.
倡议发出后，有医疗背景的志愿者闵磊、戴珅懿、韩志毅主动联系到她加入互助群，四人一起逐一统计每个家庭具体的药物需求和数量。
After the launch of the initiative, volunteers with medical background Min Lei, Dai Shen Yi and Han Zhiyi contacted her to join the mutual help group.
花妈告诉澎湃新闻，目前群里已经有百余名家长前来求助，有癫痫药物需求的12个地区涵盖：随州、孝感、黄石、武汉、十堰、荆门、荆州、黄冈、天门、咸宁、襄阳和仙桃。
Flower Mum told Pai Pai news, there have been more than 100 parents in the group to seek help, there is epileptic demand in 12 areas: Suizhou, Xiaoshi, Huang Shi, Wuhan, Shiyan, Jingmen, Jingzhou, Huanggang, Tianmen, Xianning, Xiangyang and Xiangyang.
2月10日，花妈在澎湃新闻采访时总结了目前湖北患儿缺药主要问题及难点。
On Feb. 10, HuaMa summed up the main problems and difficulties of drug deficiency in Hubei children in the Pai news interview.
首先，癫痫药物种类多，缺乏综合采购平台，网上大平台由于顺丰等物流推迟湖北客户发货。
First, many types of epileptic drugs, lack of a comprehensive procurement platform, large online platform due to Shunfeng logistics delay Hubei customers delivery.
其次，湖北癫痫药只有市级大药房有有少量存货，较为分散，药品种类不全，目前志愿者正在做的工作是联系湖北医药公司在药店根据需要发药。
Second, Hubei epileptic drugs only have a small number of large municipal pharmacies, more scattered, not all kinds of drugs, the volunteers are currently doing is contact Hubei Pharmaceutical Company in pharmacies according to the need for medicine.
花妈坦言，最大的难点在于物流，“目前只有邮政快递可以走，但是据我们了解，镇上工作人员3天才去一次县里邮局，EMS到县之后，如果不催可以停留一周甚至更多时间，效率也高不起来，外加一些乡村村路物理隔绝，路被挖断，取件存在困难。
'At the moment, only postal couriers can go, but we understand that town workers go to county post offices in three days, 'says Ms. Hua.' When EMS arrives in the county, it's not efficient to stay for a week or more.
”此外，对于民间自行交换寄药，花妈也有隐忧，在她看来，自购药物的规格和型号并不统一，贸然交换的风险较大，她呼吁家长尽量通过正规渠道购买，同时也希望能有更多的社会力量参与进来，帮助解决湖北癫痫宝宝的药荒。
In addition, there are concerns about private exchanges of medicines, which, in her view, do not have uniform specifications and models and pose a greater risk of precipitous exchange. She calls on parents to make every effort to purchase them through formal channels, and hopes that more social forces will be involved to help solve the drug shortage of Hubei epileptic babies.
所幸的是，几日来，志愿者们努力在湖北省外联系到一些销售常见癫痫药物的药企和药房，采用代买的方式，紧急调配到第一批药物，已于近日通过邮政快递发出，很快将送达家长手中。
Fortunately, over the past few days, volunteers have made efforts to contact some pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies selling common epileptic drugs outside Hubei Province. The first batch of drugs was dispatched by courier recently and will soon reach parents.
2月9日，在焦急等待一周后，谢晓英终于在回龙镇邮政快递接收点拿到了寄自安徽和湖南的两个包裹，里面装有5瓶德巴金和2瓶妥泰。
On February 9, after waiting anxiously for a week, Xie finally got two parcels from Anhui and Hunan at the Huilongzhen Post Express receiving point, containing five bottles of Dbajin and two bottles of tootai.
谢晓英告诉澎湃新闻，德巴金够聪聪吃四个月，妥泰够吃两个月，“药到了，我的儿子不会死了，我要好好照顾他，但还有很多孩子的药还没着落，那些妈妈的心情和我是一样的，虽然娃有病，大家都从没放弃过。
"The medicine is coming, my son is not going to die, I'm going to take good care of him, but there are still a lot of children who are still in the same mood as me, even though they never give up despite the baby.
