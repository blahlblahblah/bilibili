作者 | 第一财经陈洪杰2月26日，是春节后的第33天，也是浙江一家防护服企业鼠年开张的第33天。
Chen Hongjie, the first financial officer, was the 33rd day after the Spring Festival and the 33rd day of a Zhejiang protective clothing company's mouse year.
早在节前腊月二十九，老板郑懿突然接到当地政府相关工作人员的电话，“疫情严重起来、急需防护服”，于是他连夜赶回工厂。
As early as the festive season 29, boss Zheng Yi suddenly received a telephone call from the local government staff concerned, "the outbreak of serious, badly needed protective clothing," so he rushed back to the factory overnight.
大年三十，动员工人；大年初一，复工。
New Year's Day, mobilize workers; New Year's Day, resume work.
郑懿告诉第一财经记者，目前，工厂每天产出医用防护服2000多套。
Zheng Yi told the first financial reporter that at present, the factory produces more than 2,000 medical protective suits every day.
在大年初二浙江台州市黄岩农商行提供了500万元免息贷款后，短期不缺资金。
In the second year of New Year Zhejiang Taizhou Huangyan comptoir to provide interest-free loans of 5 million yuan, short-term capital.
压力大的是，员工的工资、社保开支，物流成本也高涨，另外，医用防护服的辅料即将用尽，但上游企业复工率尚低，难以采购。
The pressure is on employees' wages, social security spending and logistics costs, as well as the fact that supplies for medical protective clothing are running out, but the rate of restarting work in upstream companies is low and difficult to procure.
辅料短缺郑懿有两家企业，一家以外贸出口为主，另外一家是以国内销售为主的台州黄岩依蔓工贸有限公司（下称“依蔓工贸”）。
Accessories shortage Zheng Yi has two enterprises, one to export-oriented, the other to domestic sales-based Huangyan Yimeng Co. Ltd. ("Yimeng").
节前他接到通知，复工抗疫。
He was notified before the festival to resume work against the disease.
“大年三十上午，我参加了地方政府抗疫会议。
"In the morning of New Year's Eve, I attended the local government conference against epidemic diseases.
下午和车间主任开始打电话给本地工人，反复沟通复工，一直到晚上。
Afternoon and workshop director began to call local workers, repeatedly communicate back to work until the evening.
”郑懿称。
'said Zheng Yi.
依蔓工贸大年初一开工，当时来了50多名员工。
At the beginning of the new year, there were more than 50 employees.
郑懿表示，第一天主要是对机器和相关流水线进行安装、调试与维护等。
Yi Zheng said that the first day is mainly to machine and related assembly line installation, debugging and maintenance.
“地方政府非常重视疫情防控工作。
"Local governments attach great importance to disease prevention and control.
刚开始，工厂厨师比较紧缺，街道办派了厨师来帮忙给员工做饭。
At first, factory chefs were in short supply, and the street office sent chefs to help cook for them.
还派安保协助我们，每天对员工测量体温和厂区、车间等场所消毒，让工人安心生产。
We also sent security assistance, daily staff temperature measurement and factory, workshop, and other places to disinfect, so that workers peace of mind production.
从大年初二开始，全部工人都统一安排到一家宾馆住下。
From the beginning of New Year's Day, all the workers are unified arrangements to live in a hotel.
”郑懿表示。
Yi Zheng said.
开工之初，依蔓工贸生产两种不同类型的防护服，一款是社区防护、关卡点、工厂型的普通防护服，另一款是一线医院的医用防护服。
At the start of construction, two different types of protective clothing were produced at the start of the construction, one for community protection, one for checkpoints, one for factories and the other for medical protective clothing for first-line hospitals.
到了正月初七初八，每天生产4000套这两类防护服，普通防护服为主。
On the eighth day of the first month, 4000 sets of these two types of protective clothing daily, ordinary protective clothing.
后来，医用防护服需求更为急迫。
Later, the need for medical protective clothing became more urgent.
依蔓工贸在2月5日之后，就对第一款普通防护服停产，只做医用防护服，每天的产量是2000多套。
After Feb. 5, Yimeng stopped production of the first ordinary protective clothing, only medical protective clothing, the daily production of more than 2,000 sets.
郑懿告诉第一财经记者，一般来讲，生产一件医用防护服，从面料裁剪，到胶条、拉链、松紧、检验、包装工序、质检出厂等，需要十多道工序。
Zheng Yi told the first financial reporter, generally speaking, to produce a medical protective clothing, from fabric cutting, to tape, zipper, loose, inspection, packaging process, quality inspection factory, and so on, it takes more than a dozen processes.
生产医用防护服的主料是充足的，但是辅料即将面临短缺，物流费用压力也较大。
The main material for the production of medical protective clothing is sufficient, but there will be shortages of auxiliary materials, logistics cost pressure is also greater.
郑懿称，主料储存够用，而辅料，例如拉链、线、胶条、松紧带等储备不多。
Mrs Cheng said that the main stock was sufficient, while the accessories such as zippers, wires, rubber strips, elastic belts and so on were not available.
现在上游企业大多没有复工，辅料供不应求，价格也开始上涨，有些辅料供应商提出涨价15%。
Most of the upstream enterprises are not back to work, the supply of auxiliary materials, prices also began to rise, some auxiliary suppliers have proposed a price increase of 15%.
开支压力大疫情之下，中小企业的工资和社保压力不小。
Spending pressure under the pandemic, small and medium-sized enterprises wages and social security pressure is not small.
“春节期间，给工人开的是平时3倍的工资。
During the Spring Festival, workers are given three times the usual wage.
”郑懿表示。
Yi Zheng said.
工人中有35%滞留在家乡回不来，企业要为他们缴纳社保。
Thirty-five percent of the workers are stuck at home, and companies pay for their social security.
为了全力支持依蔓工贸生产医疗防护服，郑懿还从他的外贸出口公司调集人手，并让该公司暂时停产。
To fully support Emam's production of medical protective clothing, Zheng Yi also mobilized manpower from his foreign trade export company and let the company suspend production.
由于外贸出口公司员工工资稍高，整体成本增加。
The overall cost increases as a result of slightly higher wages for export companies.
而且，由于防护服是战略物资，两家公司的综合利润与去年同期相比大概下降了30%～40%。
And because the suits are strategic goods, the combined profits of the two companies are down about 30% to 40% from the same period last year.
另外，物流成本涨价的压力也很大。
In addition, logistics cost pressures are also very high.
郑懿称，疫情之下，物流运输都是发空运，以前一批胶条的陆运价格只需几百元，空运一千元左右。
Zheng Yi said that under the epidemic, logistics transport is sent by air, a batch of plastic strips before the price of land transport only a few hundred yuan, about 1,000 yuan by air.
最近工厂买了三批胶条，空运费用就花了12000元。
The factory bought three batches of glue recently, and the airfreight cost 12,000 yuan.
日前，台州发布《全力加快疫情防控物资生产的十条意见》称，鼓励纳入省、市统一征用、调拨的防疫应急物资生产企业和转型生产防疫应急物资且纳入省、市统一征用、调拨的企业，抓紧开展扩产扩能和技术改造，应急技术改造经费按设备投资额的50%给予补助，最高不超过200万元，所需资金积极争取上级相关补助，由市疫情防控经费统筹支付；加大疫情防控新产品研发攻关，在新产品上市后，视实际情况由市科技专项资金给予一定额度的奖励。

”上述文件称。
"said the document.
资金充足郑懿称，今年上半年不会进行大幅厂房改造和土地购置，再加上近期黄岩农商行给予500万元免息信用贷款，短期是不缺资金的。
Full funding said Zheng Yi, this first half of this year will not be major plant renovation and land acquisition, plus the recent yellow rock comptoir granted 5 million yuan interest-free credit loans, short-term capital is not lacking.
“大年初二一早，黄岩农商行董事长、行长携业务部门及支行工作人员就上门到工厂调研资金需求，中午开户，下午银行授信、审批部门通过，4点半之前，银行的500万元贷款资金到达公司账户。
"In the early morning of New Year's Day, the chairman of Huangyan comptoir, with his business department and branch staff, came to the factory to investigate the financial needs, opened an account at noon, afternoon the bank credit approval department approved, before 4: 30, the bank's 5 million yuan loan funds arrived in the company account.
要知道，此前，依蔓工贸并没有和黄岩农商行有过业务往来。
You know, until now, Yimeng did not do business with Huang Yan Agricultural Company.
”郑懿表示。
Yi Zheng said.

On February 24, the general manager of Huangyan Nongcomptoir Company told the First Financial Reporter: "The whole bank fully supports the orderly start of MSMEs. As long as there is a demand for loans from enterprises, we will do so on that day.
”上述农商行人士告诉第一财经记者，为支持复工复产，黄岩农商行制定了《金融服务八条专项措施的通知》。
