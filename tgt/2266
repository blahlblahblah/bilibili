国内非湖北地区25日新增病例24例，其中北京10例，从这些地方接受医学观察者数量、新增疑似病例以及待排查疑似病例等上游数据均持续稳步下降的态势看，此数据大幅反弹应属异常。
China's non-Hubei region 25 new cases of 24 cases, 10 of Beijing, from where the number of medical observers, new suspected cases and the number of suspected cases waiting to be detected continue to steadily decline, this data should be an anomaly.
本文1849字，阅读全文约2分钟图/pixabay文 |《财经》数据研究员徐进 图 |《财经》视觉中心编辑 | 谢丽容一、累计确诊病例：全国总病例数有望控制在8万例左右截至2月26日24:00，31个省（自治区、直辖市）和新疆生产建设兵团累计报告确诊新冠肺炎病例78497例，新增病例433例。
As at 2400 hours on February 26, a cumulative total of 78,497 new cases of pneumonia have been reported and 433 new cases reported by 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
图1二、新增病例：北京、张家口等地出现异常反弹图2国内非湖北地区25日新增病例24例，其中北京10例，出现大幅反弹。
Fig. 1, new cases: Beijing, Zhangjiakou and other places showed abnormal rebound Figure 2 China's non-Hubei region 25 new cases of 24, of which 10 Beijing cases, showed a sharp rebound.
从这些地方接受医学观察者数量、新增疑似病例以及待排查疑似病例等上游数据均持续稳步下降的态势看，此数据大幅反弹应属异常。
Given the steady and steady decline in the number of medical observers, new suspected cases, and the number of suspected cases waiting to be cleared up from these locations, the sharp rebound should be unusual.
北京卫健委发布的信息指此10例均为2月25日北京市公布病例的密切接触者发病后诊断病例，经现场流行病学调查，判断该起疫情为输入性单位聚集性疫情。
According to the information released by the Beijing Fitness and Health Commission, all 10 cases were diagnosed after close contacts were reported in Beijing on February 25.
反弹较大的还有河北张口市（5例）、四川甘孜州（3例）等，从此前湖北武汉几次异常数据波动的情况看，进行某种存量病例消化的可能性较大。
There were also large rebound in Hebei Province, Zhangkou City (5 cases), Ganzi County, Sichuan Province (3 cases), since the former Wuhan, Hubei Province, abnormal data fluctuations, the likelihood of digestion of a certain stock of cases is higher.
我们期待有关方面进一步的消息和解释。
We look forward to further information and explanations from the parties concerned.
图3湖北非武汉地区虽总体下降，但孝感一地出现15例，值得关注。
Fig. 3 Although the overall decline in Hubei non-Wuhan area, but filial piety in one place 15 cases, worthy of attention.
图4武汉的数字似乎显示其又在消化一个小的堰塞湖。
Figure 4 Wuhan figures seem to show that it is digesting a small Yan Sehu.
读者刘洋认为：武汉近几日数据在一个平台期震荡，而没有持续下降的核心原因有三个，且依次递减：1)武汉长期资源不足，倒逼“密切接触者”的口径偏窄，1：4左右，而武汉以外地区很早就高达1：30以上了，现在资源跟上来了，就有了新一轮的拉网筛查；2)各地社区基层组织能力不同，此前有武汉当地人频频抱怨自己所在小区没有被排查，这部分只有重新拉网排查，这会令一些区域在一个时间内集中出现新增确诊病例数；3)应该只有极小概率是因为前期小区没有充分封闭导致的二次传播，比如个别小卖部的问题，从外地经验看这部分因素很难影响大数据池子，但管理起来却像大海捞针，难免过度从严管理。
There are three core reasons why Wuhan has not experienced a sustained decline in recent days: (1) Wuhan has insufficient resources to force the "close contacts" to be narrow in calibre, such as 1: 4, and local communities outside Wuhan often complain about the lack of resources, this part of the local community can not affect the big data pool, but management is like looking for needle.
综上所述，读者刘洋预测，除非一次性暴雷事件，近期武汉确诊数就会出现大幅度下降。
To sum up, the reader Liu Yang predicts, unless one-time thunderstorm incident, Wuhan will be diagnosed in the near future will drop significantly.
同理，今日孝感出现的15例新增确诊病例可能也是相似原因，因为前期其返乡人数最多，导致疑似、密切接触者的口径太宽，从而延长了二次排查窗口期。
Similarly, the 15 newly confirmed cases of filial piety that occurred today may be similar, as the largest number of returnees occurred in the previous period, resulting in a wide calibre of suspected, close contacts, thus prolonging the secondary screening window period.
小编比较认同读者刘洋的解读。
Xiao Yang agreed with the reader's interpretation.
三、确诊病例增长率：非湖北地区异常反弹图5湖北非武汉地区降至0.20%以内，武汉和国内非湖北地区出现反弹。
The rate of increase of confirmed cases: the abnormal rebound in non-Hubei region fell to 0.20% in non-Wuhan area of Hubei Province, and the rebound occurred in Wuhan and non-Hubei areas of China.
四、密切接触者追踪图6湖北该指标一直远低于非湖北地区。
Close Contacts Tracking Fig. 6 This indicator has been far lower in Hubei than in non-Hubei areas.
考虑到湖北，特别是武汉实行社区封闭管理，人员流动和社交活动已受限制，有这样的追踪比，应大体合理。
Considering the closed community management in Hubei, Wuhan in particular, where mobility and social activities have been restricted, such tracking ratio should be generally reasonable.
而由于有较大资源优势，非湖北地区近三日追踪比已达到150左右。
Due to the advantage of large resources, the tracking ratio in non-Hubei area has reached about 150 in the past three days.
图7该存量继续下降，意味着不断释放更多医疗资源、社会人力资源和隔离空间投入到新的密切接触者追踪、隔离上。
Figure 7 shows that this stock continues to decline, meaning that more medical resources, social human resources and isolated spaces are increasingly being released into new close contacts to track and isolate.
五、疑似病例：非湖北地区继续下降，湖北地区有所回升图8继续下降，符合预期。
Suspected Cases: Non-Hubei areas continue to decline, Hubei region has rebounded Figure 8 continues to decline, in line with expectations.
图9非湖北地区延续持续下降的趋势，湖北在拉网排查取得成功后，已连续多日下降，印证“拉网筛查”战果。
Fig. 9 Non-Hubei area continued to decline, Hubei after the success of screening, has been falling for many days, confirming the results of "pull screen screening."
也符合我们的预期。
And it's in line with our expectations.
六、在院治疗人数：继续释放医疗资源，武汉资源状况已完全逆转图10在院治疗人数存量下降，继续成规模释放病床床位。
In-hospital treatment: continue to release medical resources, Wuhan has completely reversed the resource situation Figure 10 The number of people in the hospital decline, continue to release beds on a large scale.
推测出的“湖北确诊未入院”人数也继续下降。
The number of people diagnosed as unhospitalized in Hubei province also continued to decline.
七、病死率缓升、治愈率以更快速度上升图11病死率自2月上旬以来持续缓升，基本符合疫情中病死率变化正常特征。
Figure 11 The fatality rate has been rising slowly since early February, which is basically in line with the normal pattern of disease mortality in the epidemic.
但在湖北特别是武汉，也有救治措施不到位因素。
But in Hubei, Wuhan in particular, there are also factors that are not in place.
2月24日，中央应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议特别指出，武汉要落实分类收治措施，尽最大努力降低病死率。
On February 24, the meeting of the Central Leading Group for the Response to the New Crown Pneumonia epidemic stressed that Wuhan should implement classified treatment measures and do its utmost to reduce the fatality rate.
近日，中央有关加强救治能力的一系列措施正在加快实施，2月24日中央应对新冠肺炎疫情工作领导小组会议上进一步强调了武汉市要进一步落实排查和分类收治措施，全面提高救治能力，尽最大努力提高治愈率、降低病亡率，有针对性加大重症和危重症患者救治力度，推进轻症患者治疗“关口前移”，防止轻症转为重症。
In recent days, the central government is speeding up the implementation of a series of measures to strengthen treatment capacity. At the meeting of the Leading Group of the Central Committee for Handling New Crowded Pneumonia on February 24, the central government further emphasized that Wuhan should further implement treatment and quarantine measures, improve treatment capacity across the board, strive to improve cure rate and reduce fatality rate.
从重症率较快下降可以推测，加强救治的一系列措施正在使各地特别是武汉的救治形势发生较大变化。
From the rapid decline in the rate of serious illness can be inferred that a series of measures to strengthen treatment is making the treatment situation, especially in Wuhan, great changes.
图11.1图12治愈率以更快速度上升。
Figure 11.1 shows a faster rate of increase in cure rates.
八、新增确诊和新增治愈剪刀差继续扩大图13.1图13.2新增确诊病例数和新增治愈病例数剪刀差继续扩大，资源持续释放，已经使武汉的救治资源情况发生了根本逆转。
Figure 13.2 shows that the number of newly confirmed cases and the number of newly cured cases continue to widen, and the resources released have made a fundamental reversal of the treatment resources in Wuhan.
由原来的“人等床”变成了“床等人”。
From the original "people wait for bed" into a "bed and so on."
九、海外新增病例557例，首次超过国内图14从海外每日新增病例图可见，海外的疫情仍在不断增长扩散中，迄今未见转缓迹象。
For the first time, 557 new cases have been recorded overseas, surpassing the figure of 14 new cases per day from overseas.
海外的新增病例数首次超过中国。
The number of new cases overseas surpassed that of China for the first time.
近日在韩国和意大利持续扩散，分别新增284和147病例，引起关注。
The recent proliferation in South Korea and Italy, with 284 and 147 new cases respectively, is cause for concern.
小结：国内非湖北地区新增病例异常地大幅反弹，海外新增病例首超国内。
Summary: New cases in non-Hubei areas of China have rebounded dramatically, with overseas new cases surpassing those in China.

Do newly released patients "relapse"? Very few patients with suspected false-negative nucleic acid testing have different timing, course, and difficulty in finding out whether they have relapsed or have not been cured?
