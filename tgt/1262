我想说，疫情当前，不光是我们一线工作人员，而是所有人都在努力。
I would like to say that the epidemic is currently being fought not only by our front-line staff, but by all.
口述 | 孙明沁整理 | 应　琛1月28日晚，记得那是一个雨夜，我刚刚登临检疫完一架航班，回到上海浦东国际机场海关值机处的办公地，在门口正好遇上两位同事已经一路小跑准备出发，办公室里放着热了好几次，才刚吃了一半的盒饭。
At the evening of 28 January, as I remember it was a rainy night, I had just boarded a quarantine flight back to the office of the Pudong International Airport's customs check-in office, where I met two colleagues who had been taking a long run to get ready for departure.
隔着蒙上一层薄雾的防护面屏，我们甚至连对方是谁都不知道。
We don't even know who the other person is, across the foggy screen.
我们当时还是24小时的班，早上9点交接班。
We were on a 24-hour shift, handing over at 9 a. m.
距离这个点，我和同事已经连续工作近14小时，我们当天一共登临检疫了100多架航班。
At this point, my colleagues and I have been working for nearly 14 hours in a row, and we boarded and quarantined over 100 flights that day.
海关关员孙明沁（左一）、陈旭和李皓在登临机舱前分析重点关注旅客名单，明确分工和工作重点对自身防护进行脱穿消毒后，我和搭档也要出发了。
Customs officers Sun Mingqin (first from the left), Chen Xu and Lee Hao focus on passenger manifest analysis before boarding the cabin, clear division of labour and priorities to disinfect their own protection, my partner and I are about to leave.
当时有6个需要登临检疫的航班几乎同时落地，而我分配到的航班停在远机位，机上搭载了26名重点疫情地区来的旅客。
Six quarantine flights landed almost simultaneously, and my assigned flight was in a long-haul seat carrying 26 passengers from key affected areas.
因为当时上海海关从其他关调派了很多同事来支援我们值机处和旅检处。
At that time, Shanghai Customs seconded many colleagues from other places to support our Duty Office and Travel Inspection Office.
虽然大家都具有医学背景，但他们对于我们整套流程还是不熟悉的。
Although everyone has a medical background, they are not familiar with our entire process.
所以一开始，除了见缝插针地给他们讲流程和设备的使用方法，我们都是采取“一老带一新或两新”的方式在实际工作中对他们进行培训。
So at first, apart from explaining the process and how to use the equipment, we trained them in the actual work in a "new or new way."
孙明沁为支援同志讲解电子体温计使用方法在前往停机坪的车上，我反复检查仪器设备有无故障，所携带的单证表格是否准确无误是否够量，也在和调来的同事重复上机后的操作流程。
On my way to the tarmac, I repeatedly checked whether the equipment was faulty, whether the supporting documents and forms were accurate and sufficient, and repeated the operation procedure after the transfer.
来到远机位，看见该航班缓缓靠近桥位，远机舷梯迅速搭准舱门，下车后暴雨瞬间打湿了我们的防护面屏，一度让我们看不清前方的道路。
When we arrived at the long-distance seat, we saw the flight slowly approaching the bridge, the long-distance gangway quickly picked up the hatch, and then the rainstorm immediately wet our shield, once let us not see the road ahead.
我本能地甩了一下头，凭借着经验登上舷梯，现场确认了机上的信息后，航空公司示意航班机组打开舱门。
Instinctively I shook my head, got on the gangway empirically, checked the information on board and signaled the flight crew to open the door.
与航空公司乘务长确认申报情况，交接旅客名单，锁定机上待排查人员具体方位后，我们出现在机上所有旅客的面前。
After confirming the declaration with the airline steward, handing over the passenger manifest and locking in the exact position of the person waiting to be cleared, we appeared in front of all the passengers on board.
海关关员准备登临航空器开展监管虽然平时我们都会有登临检疫的工作，但频率不会像近期这么高。
Customs officers are preparing to board the aircraft for surveillance Although we usually have boarding and quarantine work, the frequency will not be as high as in the recent past.
所以，很多旅客都没见过全身防护服的海关关员。
Therefore, many passengers have not seen the full body protective clothing customs officers.
我们一开始上飞机的时候，还有旅客会拿手机拍。
When we first get on the plane, there are also passengers who take cell phone rackets.
有的是出于好奇，而有的可能会拿来发个微博，把我们的正常工作加工成不必要的“恐慌”。
Some out of curiosity, some may use a micro blog, our normal work into unnecessary "panic."
所以，我们都会和旅客耐心解释清楚，请他们收好手机。
Therefore, we will explain patiently with the passengers, ask them to put away their mobile phones.
到后面，这种情况就越来越少了。
In the latter case, the situation becomes less and less so.
基本上大家都是坐在原来的位置，耐心地等我们开展工作。
Basically, people are sitting in their seats, patiently waiting for us to get down to work.
当时，各个航空公司在有空位的情况下都会将这些团组尽可能安排在飞机的最后几排，一来是方便我们排查，二来也是与其他旅客隔开距离。
At that time, airlines would arrange these groups as far as possible in the last rows of the aircraft, if available, both for ease of inspection and to keep them away from other passengers.
我和同事便艰难地穿过狭小的过道往机尾走去，途经旅客的脸上透露着各种情绪。
My colleagues and I trudged down the narrow aisle to the back of the plane, revealing emotions on the faces of passengers.
待检查的旅客自然很紧张，但非重点疫情地区的旅客内心其实也很复杂。
The passengers to be checked are naturally nervous, but the passengers in the non-priority epidemic areas are actually very complicated.
海关关员在航空器内检查旅客身份信息这架航班还算顺利，体温都正常。
The customs officer checked the identity of the passengers on board the aircraft. The flight was smooth and its temperature was all right.
我们对26个人逐一进行身份确认，体温检测，流行病学调查，以及医学排查。
We did an individual identity check, a body temperature test, an epidemiological investigation, and a medical screening of 26 people.
“请问您是几月几日离开湖北省的？”“请问您14天内有没有居住或者去过湖北省？”“请问您身边有没有发热或者乏力干咳等其他呼吸道症状？”“您的温度偏高，我将为您复测，请暂时取下您的口罩，张嘴抬舌、压舌闭口。
What day did you leave Hubei Province in what monthDo you live or have you been to Hubei Province in 14 daysDo you have any other respiratory symptoms such as fever or dry cough at your side
”……我们一度被口罩闷得喘不过气起来，靠着调整呼吸频率来降低耗氧量。
... "We were suffocated by the mask for a while, reducing oxygen consumption by adjusting the frequency of our breathing.
30分钟后全部排查完毕，我们告诉航空公司，机上其他旅客可以放行。
After 30 minutes have been cleared up, we told the airline, the other passengers on board can be released.
正在此时，前方的旅客居然集体起身。
Just then, the passengers in front of them got up collectively.
我下意识地一个紧张。
I was subconsciously nervous.
“我们可以鼓掌吗？”在一名旅客的带头下机上响起了热烈的掌声，久久未息。
"Can we clap?" There was a prolonged round of applause as a passenger headed off the plane.
看着机上的气氛由凝重到放松，那一刻我整个人沉浸在被认同和幸福感中，感觉到了一线工作的必要性，我们的到来消除了机上乘客原本内心的恐慌，让他们能愉快并安心地回家。
Watching the atmosphere of the plane from solemn to relaxed, I immersed in the moment of identity and happiness, feel the need to work first, our arrival to eliminate the original passengers on board, so that they can be happy and secure home.
戴了一天的防护口罩，孙明沁的脸上满是勒痕实际上，从大年夜到2月初，我们值机处和旅检处这两个位于口岸的海关一线部门都经历着这样高强度的工作。
Wearing a day-long face mask, Sun Mingqin's face was covered with strangulation Indeed, from New Year's Eve till early February, our two front-line customs departments at the port of call and the Travel Inspection Office experienced such intense work.
那段时间主要是重点疫情地区来的团组比较多。
At that time, the groups mainly came from the key epidemic areas.
就我自己来说，最高峰的那几天，真的是一分钟都不能休息。
As far as I am concerned, the highest peak of those days is really not a minute to rest.
脑子整个都是蒙的，完全不能思考其他任何事情。
The brain is all masked and completely unable to think of anything else.
因为不喝水，不上厕所，只能逮着机会扒上几口饭，完全是靠反反复复过检疫流程才能给自己“打鸡血”，保持清醒。
Do not drink water, do not go to the toilet, can only seize a few mouthfuls of rice, rely on repeated quarantine procedures to give themselves "chicken blood", stay awake.
那段日子，每天从交接班开始，电话铃声便持续不断。
In those days, the telephone rang continuously from the beginning of the shift.
“喂？海关吗？这里是XX航空，我们从东京回来的航班上有8名重点旅客，预到时间是00:55。
This is XX Airlines, and we have eight key passengers on our flight back from Tokyo. The expected time is 00: 55.
”我们处的接线员快速在本子上做着记录，一天下来本子上密密麻麻写满了航班号。
Our operator quickly wrote down the notes, which were filled with flight numbers at the end of the day.
我结束了24小时的工作，下班回到家，基本上需要在家休息很久，才能缓过来。
I finished 24 hours of work, came home from work, and basically needed a long rest at home to recover.
虽然很累，但在我们工作的过程中，整个流程越来越顺，旅客的配合度也越来越高。
Although very tired, but in the course of our work, the whole process is more and more smooth, the degree of passenger cooperation is more and more high.
而这些天随着航班量的下降，重点地区来的主要是散客为主，以及我们调整了排班，整个工作强度较之前有所缓解。
These days, with the decline in the number of flights, the main focus areas are mainly retail customers, and we have adjusted scheduling, the overall intensity of the work has been somewhat less.
通过我们的有效排查，在我们的转诊送指定医院、转运送指定隔离点的旅客中，其实后来经过发布的是有确诊病例的。
Through our effective screening, of the passengers who were referred to designated hospitals and transferred to designated isolation points, there were confirmed cases that were subsequently issued.
而除了我刚才提到的全体鼓掌的时刻，还有许多令我感动的细节。
In addition to the applause I have just mentioned for all of you, there are many other details that move me.
我记得在测温过程中，一名旅客说道，我们一路上特别小心，连喷嚏都不敢打，每天测温两次，就怕给别人添麻烦。
I remember, during the temperature measurement, one passenger said that we were so careful that we didn't sneeze. We took two temperature measurements every day for fear of causing trouble to others.
还有几个六七岁的小朋友。
And a couple of six- or seven-year-olds.
他们这个团里因为有发烧的同行者。
They have a fever in their regiment.
其他人是要作为密切接触者送往指定地点隔离观察的。
Others were transported as close contacts to designated sites for isolated observation.
你会发现，有时候大人的焦虑情绪，小孩也是会受到感染的。
You will find that sometimes the anxiety of adults, children can also be infected.
他们见到我们第一句话居然是，“阿姨，上海很安全是吗？”然后又会说，“这次都没能好好玩，有些失望，但想到现在这个情况，也只能算了，以后再去。
They would say, "Auntie, Shanghai is safe, isn't it?" And then they would say, "It wasn't fun this time, a bit disappointing, but I can't think of anything else but just forget about the situation and go back later.
”我想说，疫情当前，不光是我们一线工作人员，而是所有人都在努力。
I want to say that the epidemic is not just happening to our front-line workers, but to all of us.
