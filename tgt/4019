直播带货真假难辨，但捐出去的那1.5亿确实是真金白银。
Live delivery is hard to tell, but the $150 million donated is real gold and silver.
。
.
最近这段时间，国内爆发的新型肺炎疫情牵动着很多人的心，不管从新闻公开的报道，还是相关部门公布的疫情情况，都能够很直观的感受到武汉的医用物资十分紧张。
Recently, the outbreak of a new type of pneumonia in China touched the hearts of many people, whether from the open news reports, or the relevant departments released the situation, can be very intuitive to feel Wuhan very tense medical supplies.
有不少企业带头捐款、捐物，一些明星通过自己成立的基金会筹集着善款，能力有限的普通人也通过各种渠道献出一份心意。
Many enterprises take the lead in donating donations, some stars raise money through their own foundation, and ordinary people with limited ability contribute their hearts through various channels.
。
.
捐款相关的新闻一度占满了各个平台的热搜，评论里掺杂了很多情绪，这其中有因善款未能合理分配而产生的愤怒，也有为每个淳朴善良的瞬间而发自内心的感动。
Donations-related news once filled platforms with fervor, mixed with emotions ranging from anger over the misallocation of good money to heartfelt touching for every simple moment of kindness.
。
.
在众多捐款消息中，“辛有志捐出一亿五千万”足够吸引眼球，毕竟国内不少一线互联网公司都没能捐到这个数字，而更令人感到好奇的是，辛有志是谁？。
Among the many donations, "Xin is willing to donate 150 million" enough to attract attention, after all, a number of China's first-tier Internet companies have not contributed to this number, and more intriguingly, who Xin?
辛有志在快手有3000多万粉丝，去年淘宝官方公布的“电商达人年度卖货榜单”中显示，他在所有主播中排名第一。
Zinn, who has more than 30 million fans on the fast track, finished last year with Taobao's official annual list of TV commercials showing him number one of all broadcasters.
虽然与在淘宝直播的李佳琦同属于顶级流量的带货主播，但在快手平台之外，他的影响力并不如李佳琦。
Although with Taobao live Li Jia Qi is the top traffic with the carrier multicast, but outside the fast platform, he is not as influential as Li Jiaqi.
。
.
从微博的粉丝量可以直观的看出这种差距，李佳琦在微博有1000多万粉丝，而辛有志仅有74万，刚好是李佳琦的零头。
Weibo fans can be intuitive to see this gap, Li Jiaqi in Weibo has more than 10 million fans, but Xinzhizhi only 740,000, just a fraction of Li Jiaqi.
这也是为什么，当“辛有志捐出一亿五千万”的消息出现在热搜时，很多网友对这个名字感到陌生。
That's why many netizens are unfamiliar with the name when news of Xin's willingness to donate $150 million surfaced in the heat search.
。
.
其实辛有志在过去的2019年里没少露过面，从一些热搜中都能找到他的身影。
In fact, Xin is determined in the past 2019 not less exposed, from a number of hot search can be found in his shadow.
只不过他在微博上并没有李佳琦那样的辨识度，媒体在发布相关消息时，大多将辛有志的姓名省略，用“网红”代替。
However, he did not have the same Weibo identification, the media in the release of relevant information, the majority of Xin aspirant name omitted, with the "net red" instead.
。
.
比如去年8月18日，辛有志在北京奥体中心请来42位明星办了一场婚礼，胡海泉当司仪、张柏芝送礼物、成龙压轴出场，声势很浩大，当时还上了微博热搜，但话题是“网红结婚花5千万请42位明星”。
For example, on Aug. 18 last year, Xin Zhi invited 42 stars to a wedding at the Olympic Stadium in Beijing. Hu Haiquan was the master of ceremonies, Cecilia Cheung presented gifts and Jackie Chan made a big show.
。
.
如果你对这个婚礼没有印象的话，可能还看过一段成龙被伴舞意外飞踹的短视频，这个小插曲就是发生在辛有志的婚礼上。
If you had no idea about the wedding, you might have seen a short video of Jackie Chan being kicked accidentally by a dance partner at the wedding.
。
.
在更早前，郭富城的一组大眼睛、尖下巴的美颜直播照上了热搜，几乎没人留意到坐在一旁帮忙推销商品的主播，而那个主播正是辛有志。
Earlier, a group of Guo Fucheng's big-eyed, sharp-jawed beauty caught the heat, and hardly anyone noticed the anchorman sitting by to help sell his wares.
。
.
辛有志的经历和气质与快手这片土壤相处的十分融洽。
Xinzhi has the experience and temperament and the quick hand this soil to get along very well.
他在3000万粉丝的大号简介中称自己是“农民的儿子”“百姓主播”，他的励志、鸡汤故事被粉丝们传颂，但电商主播和微商色彩的身份也让不少人在网上声讨“还我血汗钱”。
His inspirational, chicken-soup story has become a hit with fans as he describes himself as the "son of the farmer" and "anchor of the people" in a huge profile of 30 million fans. But his inspirational and chicken-soup stories have become popular with fans, but the presence of TV anchormen and micromarketers has led many online to denounce "paying me back."
。
.
辛有志在直播间和媒体前，不止一次讲过他的成长故事。
Xin is determined to tell his growth story more than once, both on the air and in front of the media.
。
.
成龙与辛有志。
Jackie Chan and Zheng Zhi.
他出生于黑龙江通河，小时候家里很穷，父亲靠着借来的一千块钱才结了婚，一家人住在一间仓库中，晚上躺在床上时，可以透过仓库顶上的漏洞看星星。
He was born on the Heilongjiang River. When he was a child, his father was very poor. He married with a thousand dollars borrowed.
。
.
辛有志在新浪娱乐的采访中提到自己因成绩差，早早辍了学。
Xin Yizhi mentioned in an interview with Sina Entertainment that he dropped out early because of poor grades.
白天跟着父亲上山采野菜，晚上拉网捕鱼，家里的经济条件逐渐好了起来，盖起了房子，顺带在村中开了个小商店。
During the day he followed his father to the mountains to pick wild vegetables, and at night he caught fish with his net.
。
.
十五岁那年，他靠自己赚的钱买了一台摩托罗拉手机，看到同村长大的好友从外地打工回来，也想着去村外看看，跟父亲说他要去哈尔滨打工，“想要在二十岁的时候能开一台电视广告中看到的现代伊兰特”。
At the age of fifteen, he bought a Motorola cell phone with his own money. He saw friends growing up in the village working outside the village. He wanted to go outside the village and tell his father he was going to work in Harbin.
。
.
事实证明他并不适合给别人打工。
It turned out that he was not fit to work for others.
他在哈尔滨找了一家海鲜店打工，那是他第一次接触海鲜，也是从那时起才发现自己海鲜过敏，吃了一顿工作餐后上吐下泻，草草结束了第一份工作。
He found a seafood store job in Harbin, his first exposure to seafood, and he found himself allergic to seafood, spitting out after a working meal and finishing his first job in a hurry.
。
.
再之后他去了山东济南学挖掘机，半年时间花费了两万多，他却回来跟父亲说每天十个小时坐不住，回到家中重新干起了老本行。
Then he went to Jinan in Shandong Province to study excavators, spent more than 20, 000 half a year, he came back to tell his father that 10 hours a day can not sit down, back home to start a new business.
好在家中的小商店越做越好，山野菜也畅销，每年的效益还不错。
Fortunately, the small shops at home do better, wild vegetables also sell well, the annual benefits are not bad.
。
.
待在家里久了，辛有志还是闲不住，拿着家人给的三万块钱去通河县城做起了小生意。
Stay at home for a long time, Xin is determined or idle, with the family gave 30, 000 yuan to Tonghe County to start a small business.
从商场门口摆地摊做起，他越做越大，买了一辆面包车，开了一家名为“辛式果业”的水果超市。
Starting from a market stall, he went from strength to strength, buying a van and opening a fruit supermarket called Xinshi Fruit.
。
.
成功人士的经历也大多俗套，一帆风顺的过程中总要经历些坎坷。
The successful person's experience is also mostly cliche, the smooth sailing process always experiences some bumps.
在县城中他结识了一些新朋友，白天玩台球，晚上去酒吧，水果店的生意逐渐荒废下来。
In the county he made some new friends, played billiards during the day and went to the pub at night.
等到惊醒过来时，开水果店的银行贷款以及滞销损失的水果，让他欠下了六十多万。
By the time he woke up, he was owed more than 600,000 dollars in bank loans and unsaleable fruit.
。
.
他听说出国打工两年就能赚二十万，为了还债，拿了家里最后的7万块，办了留学签证，坐着飞机去了日本。
He heard that he could earn 200,000 yuan by working abroad for two years. In order to pay off his debts, he took the last 70,000 yuan in his family, obtained a student visa and flew to Japan.
。
.
冲着赚钱还债的辛有志在日本发现了商机。
Aspiring to make money and pay off debts found business opportunities in Japan.
当时中国留学生喜欢倒卖日本当地的花王纸尿裤，通过卖给中间商，从而换取每包五块钱左右的利润。
At that time, Chinese students liked to resell Japanese kaleidoscope diapers and sell them to middlemen in exchange for a profit of about five dollars per bag.
辛有志从早上到深夜，到处寻找售卖花王纸尿裤的商店，一天的收入能有3000块，他打电话给父亲：“60万的债，很快能还上。
Sun, who was eager to go from morning to night looking for a store selling King's diapers, made $3,000 a day, called his father and said, "Six hundred thousand dollars in debt, I'll pay it back soon.
”。
"
辛有志逐渐在日本站稳了脚跟，最初寻货时骑的自行车，更换成了一辆汽车，甚至专门租赁仓库存放货物，直接卖给国内的经销商。
Aspiring to establish himself in Japan gradually, the original search bike, replaced by a car, or even a rental warehouse to store goods, sold directly to domestic dealers.
。
.
辛有志的生意越做越大，他开始召集朋友和当地的留学生，但仓库最终被日本警方查封，理由是他非法雇佣留学生。
As his ambitious business grew, he began to gather friends and local students, but the warehouse was eventually closed by the Japanese police on the grounds that he had illegally hired foreign students.
。
.
在日本有了案底的辛有志回了国，他的手里依旧掌握着进货渠道和客户，在国内开公司做淘宝店。
In Japan, Xin who has a record to return to the country, his hands still hold the channel and customers, in the domestic company to do Taobao shop.
与此同时，快手也成了国内各个县城中的热门应用，虽然当时快手以及其他短视频平台都尚未开通直播卖货的商务功能，但他从那时起就想到了“如果有一天拥有了足够多的粉丝，就可以直接去跟用户接触。
Meanwhile, fast hands became a hot app in every county in the country, and while the fast-moving and other short-video platforms weren't yet available to sell goods live, he has since thought "if you have enough fans one day, you can go straight to the user."
”。
"
他给头部主播送礼物，在快手的直播间中刷满了存在感，不少观众开始关注他。
He sent gifts to the head master and filled the quick-hand studio with a sense of presence. Many viewers began to pay attention to him.
他以讲故事的形式分享这些年的创业心得，时不时送出自己淘宝店中的产品，日积月累，产生了一批黏性很强的观众。
He shared his years of entrepreneurship in the form of a story-telling story, occasionally giving out products from his Taobao store. Over the years, he has created a sticky audience.
。
.
直到各个平台都打通了直播卖货的功能后，辛有志与那些响当当的网红主播一样，单场直播的销售额以千万甚至亿来计算，在那场用重金砸出来的婚礼结束后，他开起了直播，当晚的销售额有1.3亿元。
By the time the platforms were able to sell live, Zinn was willing to spend tens or billions of dollars on a single live broadcast, like the ringing webmasters. After the big-ticket wedding, he broadcast the broadcast live, with sales of 130 million yuan that night.
。
.
站在风口的辛有志把握着时代的机遇，收割着财富的这些年，不断打着规则的擦边球，这也是有人厌恶辛有志的原因之一。
Standing at the mouth of the wind is determined to grasp the opportunities of the times, harvest the wealth of these years, constantly playing the rules of the edge of the ball, which is one of the reasons why some people hate Xinzhi.
。
.
辛有志在日本艰辛的创业经历确实很精彩，但归根结底是游走在违法的边缘。
Xin has the ambition to work hard in Japan's entrepreneurial experience is indeed very exciting, but in the final analysis is wandering on the edge of the law.
2014年，日本共同社报道了一起案件：。
In 2014, Kyodo reported one case:
日本兵库县警方外事课19日以违反《出入境管理及难民认定法》的嫌疑逮捕了该县明石市大久保町的台湾餐馆中国籍老板辛有志。
The Foreign Affairs Group of the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan has arrested the Chinese owner of a Taiwanese restaurant in Akashi, Akashi, on suspicion of violating the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act.
他涉嫌委托他人大量购买纸尿裤并支付报酬，助长了“非法”劳动。
He is suspected of encouraging "illegal" labour by entrusting large quantities of diapers and paying them for them.
。
.
日本警方在调查时没收了账簿，发现辛有志一年时间里卖出了总计1.4亿日元（当时约合人民币725万元）的纸尿裤。
The Japanese police confiscated books during the investigation and found that Xin had sold a total of 140 million yen (7.25 million yuan) worth of diapers in a year.
。
.
尽管如此，辛有志还是在日本获得了第一桶金，他回国后借助短视频平台、电商直播的兴起，做起了自己的产品“辛有志严选”。
Despite this, Xin was determined to get the first barrel of gold in Japan, he returned home with short video platform, the rise of live commercial television, started his own products "Xinzhi serious election."
自产自销给他带了丰厚的利润，但产品的质量也成了人们关注的焦点。
Producing and selling to him has brought him rich profits, but the quality of the product has also become the focus of attention.
快手上有位主播专门做了一期视频，质疑他的洗面奶，只是打着氨基酸旗号的大皂基。
One anchorman made a video questioning his shampoo, which was just a big saponin under the banner of amino acid.
。
.
带货主播推销的产品质量一直不让人放心，此前李佳琦在直播中推荐了一款不粘锅，在演示煎鸡蛋的环节时，鸡蛋却粘在了锅底，被网友称作是“直播翻车”。
With the quality of the product sold by the owner has been reassuring, Li Jia Qi in the broadcast recommended a non-stick pot, in the demonstration of fried eggs, but the eggs stick to the bottom of the pot, which netizens called "live overturning."
一些网友对辛有志直播时推荐的产品也有同样担忧，觉得他自称“国外售价2000的产品，国内只卖200”，是在侮辱观众的智商。
Some netizens expressed the same concern about the product that Xin recommended when he wanted to broadcast live. They thought he was insulting the intelligence quotient of the audience by claiming that he sold 2000 products abroad and only 200 at home.
。
.
除了对主播身份的不信任，辛有志还沾上了“微商头子”的称号。
In addition to the identity of the anchor distrustful, Xin is also committed to the "micro-business leader" title.
辛有志曾澄清过自己跟微商没关系，也没有研究过微商。
Xin has made it clear that he has nothing to do with micro-business, nor has he studied microquotient.
实际上他如今的销售方式确实与层层分级、类似传销模式的微商没多大关系，但北京奥体中心婚礼上的新娘、辛有志的妻子初瑞雪，却是一个如假包换的微商头子。
In fact, his marketing today does not have much to do with the hierarchical, pyramid-like micro-quotient, but the bride and aspiring wife of the Beijing Olympic Center, Xin Ruixue, is a fake micro-business leader.
。
.
初瑞雪也是个快手红人，有2000多万的粉丝，在她的快手主页背景墙上，有很多她与明星的合照。
Chu is also a big shot, with more than 20 million fans, and there are plenty of pictures of her with the stars on her home page background.
这是当年微商惯用的手法，甚至于奥巴马都曾下岗再就业，在中国以25万元一次的价格与微商们握手合影。
That was the usual way microbusinessmen used to do it. Even Mr Obama was laid off and re-employed, shaking hands with microbusinessmen for a quarter of a million yuan in China.
。
.
初瑞雪擅长使用微商惯用的奖励形式，大张旗鼓的邀请代理参加会议，用23辆朗逸、22辆宝马和8辆玛莎拉蒂豪车作为奖品。
Chu is adept at using the usual micro-quotient award form, inviting agents to the conference with 23 Langyi, 22 BMW and 8 Maserati Hao vehicles as prizes.
不少代理到处宣传自己喜提豪车的消息，引来了广州市工商局调查，结果发现只有21辆朗逸、3辆宝马、1辆玛莎拉蒂是“交付使用权”，其余的车只是充场面。
A number of agents everywhere advertised their favorite luxury cars, attracted the Guangzhou Bureau of Industry and Commerce investigation, found that only 21 Langyi, 3 BMW, 1 Maserati is "delivery of the right to use," the rest of the car is just for the occasion.
。
.
辛有志一方面有着数以千万的忠实粉丝，另一方面又带着电商主播和微商关联的原罪，这使得他一直有不小的争议。
Xin's determination to have tens of millions of fans on the one hand, and the original sin of being associated with a live anchor and microphone, on the other, has always been controversial.
这种争议放到了如今这次1亿现金、5千万物资的慈善事件上，便使得他又多了个诈捐的嫌疑。
The dispute over the $100 million in cash and $50 million in charity has added to the suspicion of fraud.
。
.
在武汉市慈善总会不断公布捐款数额期间，这种争议被逐渐放大。
The controversy was amplified during the period when the Wuhan General Association of Philanthropy kept announcing the amount of donations.
。
.
1月26日，武汉慈善总会发布了《市慈善总会关于新型肺炎防控捐赠款物公告第1期》，其中辛有志以公司的名义捐出了1000万元，有网友认为辛有志在玩文字游戏，1亿现金如今变成了1000万。
On January 26, Wuhan Philanthropy Association issued the "Municipal Charity Association Notice on New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Donations No. 1," in which Xin Yizhi donated 10 million yuan in the name of the company.
。
.
随着公告的不断更新，直到1月28日第3期公告的公布，辛有志累计捐赠了5000万现金，但1月29日发布的第4期名单上，辛有志的公司并未出现。
With the announcement of the renewal of the announcement, until January 28 issue of the announcement, Zheng Yingzhi cumulative donation of 50 million cash, but the January 29 release of the fourth issue of the list, Xin aspirant companies did not appear.
。
.
不少网友质问他“1.5亿何时到账”，嘲讽其“为了热度欺骗国家，不要脸”。
Many netizens questioned him "150 million when to account", ridicule its "in order to deceive the country heat, shame".
而辛有志严选的相关负责人则对外称，之所以现金没有到账，是因为银行转账限制。
Xin is determined to select the relevant officials said that the cash did not arrive because of restrictions on bank transfers.
就像辛有志公司所言，在武汉慈善总会随后公布的第5期和第6期捐赠公告中，辛有志先后又捐赠了4000万和1000万，加上之前的5000万，共计1亿元，兑现了此前的承诺。
In the announcement of the 5th and 6th issues of the Wuhan Philanthropy Association, Xin pledged to donate 40 million yuan and 10 million yuan, together with 50 million yuan, according to the company.
。
.
同时，那五千万的物资也通过微博视频的形式进行公示，辛有志工作室通过官方微博对外宣称“十万只口罩由江苏仓库发往武汉”。
At the same time, the 50 million materials were also posted through microblog format, Xin Yizhi studio announced through the official micro-blog that "100,000 masks sent from Jiangsu warehouse to Wuhan."
。
.
原本被黑粉占领的微博评论，一时间又挤满了辛有志的死忠粉。
Originally occupied by the black powder Weibo comments, for a while filled with Zheng Zhizhong loyal powder.
。
.
去年，辛有志举办了那场昂贵的婚礼后，有媒体问他举办这场演唱会形式的婚礼是否别有所图。
Last year, after Xin had the ambition to host the expensive wedding, some media asked him if the concert-style wedding was not intended to be different.
他的回答很干脆：“当然有所图，我的所图就是让自己的粉丝认可我，让我自己的用户在我的渠道里，对我跟别人是不一样的认知。
His answer was simple: "Of course there's something to it. What I'm trying to do is get my fans to recognize me and let my own users know me differently from others in my channel.
大家说演唱会后卖了1.3亿，但我每场直播都这样，我不需要靠做活动去做这个东西，只是希望做了活动后能让更多的品牌注意到这件事，跟我有更多合作。
People said they sold 130 million dollars after the concert, but I did it on every live show. I didn't need to do anything to do it. I just wanted more brands to notice and cooperate with me after the event.
”。
"
他甚至还毫不犹豫的承认这场声势浩大的婚礼，本质是一次公关行为。
He did not even hesitate to admit that the wedding was a public relations exercise.
。
.
辛有志是个复杂的存在，围绕他的是与非或许要归结于他是个精明的商人。
Xin Yingzhi is a complex existence, surrounded by right and wrong may be attributed to his shrewd businessman.
逐利是他的本性，他的商品可能有好有坏，有真有假，他的捐款除了善心之外也可能别有所图，但这一切的争议并不足以忽视他花出去的那1.5亿是真金白银。
Profit is his nature, and his merchandise may be good or bad, true or false, and his donations may be well-intentioned, but all this controversy is not enough to ignore the fact that the $150 million he spends is real gold and silver.
