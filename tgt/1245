"If a pregnant mother is unlucky enough to get infected, stay in a good state of mind, eat well, believe your baby will be fine, and believe that she will recover," said Xue Sasha, an intern.
”2月12日下午，澎湃新闻联系到许佳（化名）时，她如是说道。
"said Xu Jia, an alias, who was contacted by the surging news on the afternoon of February 12.
许佳的检测报告显示双肺感染。

She was nine months pregnant and worried more about her new crown pneumonia and about having her baby infected through her mother.
27日，她去医院做了检查，结果让她十分崩溃。
On the 27th, she went to the hospital for a check-up and she collapsed.
医生称，CT显示她双肺感染，属于新冠肺炎高度疑似患者，建议她立即剖腹产。
The doctor said the CT showed that she had two lung infections and was highly suspected of New Crown Pneumonia and recommended an immediate cesarean section.

1月28日，许佳转至武汉市普仁医院隔离病房治疗。

那几天，许佳的丈夫也开始发低烧，随后被医院以“疑似病人”收治。
In those days, Xu Jia's husband also began to have a low fever, and was later admitted to hospital as a "suspected patient."
经过医护人员近半个月的精心治疗，两人身体逐渐康复，核酸检测均呈阴性。
After nearly half a month of intensive treatment by medical staff, the two men gradually recovered and tested negative for nucleic acid.
2月10日，两人双双康复出院。

受访者供图【许佳口述】“不幸中的万幸”：宝宝是阴性我叫许佳，今年26岁，家住武汉市。
The interviewee provided a picture of "good luck in misfortune": My baby is negative. My name is Xu Jia. I am 26 years old.
1月23日，我开始发烧，最高烧到37.5摄氏度，还伴有咳嗽、乏力、食欲不振。
On January 23, I developed a fever that reached a peak of 37.5 degrees Celsius, with coughing, fatigue and loss of appetite.
我当时担心自己感染了新冠病毒，更担心通过母体传染给腹中宝宝。
I was worried that I was infected with the new crown virus, and I was more concerned about mother-to-child transmission.
我就去了武汉一家妇幼医院检查，医生称是普通感冒，给我开了些药服用。
I went to Wuhan a mother and child hospital to check, the doctor said it was a common cold, gave me some medicine to take.
吃药不仅未见效，我的体温还持续升高，一度烧至38摄氏度，咳嗽也愈发严重。
Not only did the medicine not work, my temperature continued to rise, reaching 38 degrees Celsius, and coughing got worse.
我感觉不太对劲，27日，我去武汉大学中南医院重新检查。
I feel not quite right, 27, I went to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital to re-examine.
CT片子显示我双肺已经感染，医生称我为“高度疑似新冠肺炎患者”，还让我做了核酸检测。
CT scans showed that my lungs were infected, and doctors called me "highly suspicious of a new crown pneumonia," and asked me for a nucleic acid test.
听到医生说我是高度疑似患者，我非常崩溃，心里一直想孩子千万不能有事。
Hearing the doctor say that I was highly suspicious, I collapsed, thinking that the child must be all right.
医院也担心孩子被感染，紧急为我安排了当晚8点的剖腹产手术。
The hospital, also worried about the baby's infection, arranged an emergency Caesarean section at 8: 00 that night.
手术顺利，当天，医院就给宝宝做了核酸检测。
The operation went smoothly and the baby was tested for nucleic acid the same day.
等待核酸检测结果的两天，真的非常煎熬。
Two days waiting for the nucleic acid test results, really suffering.
29日，结果终于出来了，我是阳性，幸运的是，宝宝是阴性。
29, the result finally came out, I am positive, luckily, the baby is negative.
得知这个结果，我长吁了一口气，我自己感染已经不算什么了，孩子没事是不幸中的万幸。
I heaved a sigh of relief when I learned that my infection was nothing. It was a blessing in disguise.
产后第二天，我转入新冠肺炎治疗的定点医院武汉市普仁医院的隔离病房治疗。
The day after the birth, I was transferred to the designated hospital for treatment of new crown pneumonia in Wuhan isolation ward.
“老公在病房照顾我被感染”孩子出生后，先在医院留观了几天，后来被家人接回老家照顾。
"Husband in the ward to take care of me infected" after the birth of the child, first in the hospital stay for a few days, then family back home to take care of.
网上有评论说孕妇的免疫力低，一旦感染，病情加重得快。
There are online comments that pregnant women have low immunity, once infected, the disease aggravates quickly.
家人很担心我对抗不了新冠病毒。
My family is worried that I can't fight the new crown virus.
住进普仁医院的隔离病房后，老公考虑到我刚生完孩子，又感染新冠病毒，遭受身体和心理上双重压力，怕我吃不消，他就向医院申请要进病房照顾我。
After I was admitted to the isolation ward of Puren Hospital, my husband applied to the hospital to take care of me, considering that I had just given birth and contracted the new crown virus.
医院本来怕他感染不允许他进病房，但我老公一直坚持，医院才破格同意。
The hospital was afraid that he would not be admitted to the ward because of his infection, but my husband insisted until the hospital agreed.
就在我转入普仁医院的那几天，我老公开始发低烧。
Just a few days after I was transferred to Puren Hospital, my husband began to have a low fever.
看到新闻上说新冠肺炎传染性很强，他28日去我家附近的一家医院拍了CT，结果显示双肺有点感染。
Seeing the news that the new crown pneumonia is very infectious, he went to a hospital near my home to take a CT scan, the results show that there is a small infection of the lungs.
他随后在普仁医院做了核酸检测，阴性。
He was subsequently tested for nucleic acid at Puerne Hospital, negative.
但医生仍要求我老公以“疑似病人”隔离治疗。
But the doctors still asked my husband to isolate him with "suspected patients."
老公也疑似感染后，我心里很内疚。
My husband is also suspected to be infected, I feel very guilty.
之前，他为了照顾我，在病房里的阳台上搭个折叠床睡觉。
Before, he took care of me and put up a folding bed on the balcony of the ward.
我猜想，他可能是因为照顾我没休息好，免疫力降低才感染的。
I guess he probably got it because he didn't take care of me and his immunity was weakened.
虽然老公也住院了，但他还安慰我说他不怕。
Even though my husband was in hospital, he comforted me by telling me he wasn't afraid.
说实话，我能康复得这么快，多亏了老公的陪伴，他陪我聊天、转移我的注意力。
To tell the truth, I can recover so quickly, thanks to my husband's company, he accompanied me to chat, divert my attention.
要是只有我一个人，我估计早就崩溃了。
If I were alone, I would have crumbled.
“医护人员都很照顾我们”因为我刚生完孩子，情况特殊，所以医护人员在对我的治疗和护理上，尤其注意。
"The paramedics take care of us." Because I just had a baby, the situation is special, so the medical staff in my treatment and care, pay special attention.
护士每天会按时来给我量体温和血氧饱和度。
The nurse would come to take my temperature and oxygen saturation on time every day.
起初，我每天要输12瓶药水，从早上9点输到晚上7点。
At first, I had to fill 12 bottles of potion every day, from 9am to 7pm.
后来我身体好转，药水减到7瓶。
Then I got better and the potion was reduced to seven bottles.
我腹部有剖腹产留下的刀口，护士每隔两三天就给我换一次药。
I had a cut from a Caesarean section in my abdomen, and the nurse changed my medication every two or three days.
病区的护士黄银让我很感动，我行动不便，她主动扶我上厕所。
The nurse in the sick area, Huang Yin, moved me. I couldn't move. She offered to help me to the toilet.
我和老公隔离无法出医院，她主动把联系方式给我，帮我们购买生活用品。
My husband and I can not leave the hospital isolation, she took the initiative to contact me to help us buy supplies.
医院的伙食也非常好。
The food in the hospital was also very good.
这里的饭菜清淡，适合病人吃，偶尔也会发牛奶、提高免疫力的奶粉给病人。
Here the food is light, suitable for patients to eat, occasionally milk, immune-boosting milk powder to patients.
有一次，食堂多出两份饭，护士就拿给我和老公，让我们多吃点。
Once, there were two more meals in the canteen. The nurse took them to my husband and me to eat more.
现在出院了，还有点想念医院的蒸蛋。
I'm out of the hospital now, and I miss the steamed eggs.
完全康复时要回家抱抱宝宝在医护人员近半个月的精心照料下，我和丈夫的身体逐渐好转。
When I fully recover, I want to go home and hug my baby. After nearly half a month of intensive care by medical staff, my husband and I are getting better.
2月9日左右，我们做了各项检查，也分别做了两次核酸检测，结果均是阴性。
Around February 9, we had tests and two separate nucleic acid tests, all negative.
主治医生评估我们的身体状况，结合CT及核酸结果，告诉我们可以出院了。
The attending physician assessed our condition, combined with CT and nucleic acid results, and told us that we could be discharged.
现在我和丈夫在家隔离观察，体温正常，我偶尔还有点咳嗽、胸闷，但身体整体状态不错，隔离后需要去医院复查。
Now my husband and I are in isolation, my temperature is normal, I occasionally cough, chest tightness, but the overall state of good health, isolation after the need to go to the hospital.
经过这段时间的治疗，我认为新冠肺炎没有大家想得那么可怕，最重要的一点就是要提高自身免疫力。
After this period of treatment, I think the new crown pneumonia is not as terrible as everyone thought, the most important point is to improve their immunity.
我还想对孕妈妈们说，如果不幸感染了新冠病毒，要保持好心态，吃好睡好，要相信宝宝一定会没事，也要相信自己会康复。
I would also like to say to pregnant mothers, if unfortunately infected with the new crown virus, to maintain a good mind, eat a good sleep, believe that the baby will be okay, but also believe that they will recover.
宝宝出生后，我和老公一直不在身边。
After the baby was born, my husband and I were away.
等我们完全康复了，我要赶紧回老家抱抱宝贝。
When we're all right, I'm gonna go home and hug the baby.
