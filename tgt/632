感觉他长大了，希望他会理解我的行为，也希望我的行为能引发他对未来的思考，学习是为了什么，将来想要成为怎样的人。
I hope that he will understand my behavior and that my actions will lead him to think about the future, what he is learning about and what he wants to be in the future.
记者 | 应　琛“过年前夕，武汉爆发了‘新型冠状病毒’，妈妈爸爸在讨论之后决定过年不出去旅游了，我表示很痛苦。
Reporters & # 124; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & nbsp; & # 45
后来妈妈自愿去支援武汉，我心想，全上海这么多护士，她基本去不了。
Later, my mother volunteered to support Wuhan, I thought, all over Shanghai so many nurses, she can not go.
但她接到通知要走了，年夜饭才吃了几口菜，这个决定也太快了。
But she was told to leave and ate only a few mouthfuls at New Year's Eve, and it was too soon.
但现在我能够接受妈妈的做法，因为她去武汉是去救一条条鲜红的生命……”受访者供图这是12岁的魏诚给身处武汉救援一线的妈妈写的一封信。
But now I can accept her mother's practice, because she went to Wuhan to save a red life... "Interviewee: This is 12-year-old Wei Cheng to Wuhan rescue line to the mother wrote a letter.
虽然很想念妈妈，但魏诚说，妈妈在武汉支援，他应该“长大一点”，懂事一点，在家好好学习，做一些力所能及的家务。
Although I miss my mother very much, Wei Cheng said that his mother in Wuhan support, he should "grow up a little bit", sensible, good study at home, do some housework according to his ability.
不过，最后魏诚还是露出了“孩子气”的一面，他在信中写道：“这样妈妈回来后，才能高高兴兴地带我出去玩。
At last, however, he showed his childish side, writing to him: "Only then can my mother come back and take me out happily.
”魏诚的妈妈冯亮是上海市胸科医院胸外专业病房的护士长，作为上海首批支援武汉医疗队的成员，如今的她在武汉金银潭医院北三病区，救治一些危重症的病人。
Wei Cheng's mother, Feng Liang, is the head nurse in the extrathoracic ward of the Shanghai Chest Hospital and was one of the first members of Shanghai's medical team to support Wuhan.
接受《新民周刊》采访时，冯亮的声音带着明显的疲惫。
In an interview with Xinmin Weekly, Feng Liang's voice was obviously tired.
她告诉记者，自己还没来得及看儿子的信，“今天虽然休息，但去帮忙同事接收了一批援助物资，刚刚忙完”。
She told reporters she had not had time to read her son's letter, "although today's rest, but to help colleagues received a batch of aid, just finished."
没有犹豫，因为武汉需要我们冯亮是在小年夜的下午四点半，看到群里征集援助武汉志愿者的信息。
There is no hesitation, because Wuhan needs us Feng Liang in the afternoon of 4: 30, see the group to help Wuhan volunteers information.
“我当时知道武汉因为这次疫情已经封城了，等于到了一个挺严重的状态，肯定缺大量的医生护士。
"I knew Wuhan had been closed down because of the outbreak and was in a rather serious state. There must be a shortage of doctors and nurses.
”冯亮的第一反应就是“我要去”，她立即征询了身边老公的意见，“我老公当时可能还不清楚疫情的具体程度，就让我去了”。
Feng Liang's first reaction was "I'm going," and she immediately asked her husband, "My husband probably didn't know the exact extent of the outbreak, so let me go.
从接到通知到截止报名只有短短半个小时，而当时医院已经处于放假的状态，冯亮觉得有人可能没有及时看到信息，她预感自己会被选上。
Only half an hour from the date of notification to the deadline for registration, and the hospital was already on holiday, Feng Liang felt that someone might not be able to see the information in time, and she had a hunch that she would be selected.
于是当晚，她就去超市买了一些速冻食物囤着。
That night, she went to the supermarket to buy some frozen food, hoarding.
她又分别去了妈妈和姨妈家，给他们送了一些准备的年夜饭菜和红包，并交代了一下情况。
She went to her mother's and aunt's respectively, gave them some prepared dinner and red envelopes, and told them the situation.
果然，第二天，冯亮就接到了领导的电话，让她准备一下，但具体出发时间未定。
Sure enough, the next day, Feng Liang received a call from the leader, asking her to prepare, but the exact time of departure has not been determined.
她赶紧收拾了行李。
She hurriedly packed her bags.
晚上6点多，原本定好在饭店吃年夜饭的一家人才刚到齐，冯亮就又接到了马上要出发的电话。
At 6: 00 pm, the family who had been scheduled to eat Chinese New Year's Eve dinner in the restaurant had just arrived. Feng Liang received another call, which was about to leave.
简单打过招呼后，她匆匆吃了两口冷菜，便赶回家中。
After a brief greeting, she ate a couple of cold dishes and hurried home.
受访者供图当晚，由136名医护人员组成的上海首批医疗队正式从虹桥机场出发。
During the night, the first medical teams from Shanghai, comprising 136 medical personnel, started from Hongqiao Airport.
2003年非典时，冯亮还是个刚刚参加工作近一年的小护士，并没有机会参与到一线的救援工作。
When SARS occurred in 2003, Feng Liang was a junior nurse who had just joined the work for nearly a year and had no opportunity to participate in front-line rescue work.
但因为是第一次经历这么重大的疫情，她至今仍保留着当时医院发的一个厚厚的棉布口罩，“而这次我有机会可以去了，作为医护人员，就是本能的反应，没有犹豫过。
But because it was the first time she had experienced such a major outbreak, she still has a thick cotton mask from the hospital at the time.
尤其是看到武汉的同行很辛苦，觉得他们需要我们”。
Especially to see Wuhan colleagues very hard, feel that they need us. "
冯亮的老公倒是有些“后悔”了。
Feng Liang's husband is a bit "regret".
“大年夜他就问我能不能不要去。
"On New Year's Eve he asked me if I could go.
”冯亮说，其实老公只是担心她，全家人都非常支持她的决定，“老公还跟我保证，我在前线支援，他搞好家里的后勤保障，照顾好两个孩子，让我没有后顾之忧”。
"My husband assured me that I was on the frontline, that he would provide the logistical support for the family and take care of the two children so that I wouldn't have to worry about anything," Feng said.
我们坚持一下，绝不降低护理标准到达武汉宾馆全部安顿好已是1月25日早上5点。
We insist that in no way lower the standards of care to arrive at Wuhan Hotel all settled down has been January 25 at 5 a.m.
当天冯亮被排到了晚班，原本是晚上12点交接班，但因为到岗第一天需要熟悉流程和环境，晚上10点，冯亮和同班的同事就到了医院。
Feng Liang was assigned to the evening shift, which was supposed to be at 12 pm, but due to the need to familiarize himself with the process and environment on his first day of work, Feng Liang and his classmates arrived at the hospital at 10: 00 pm.
本地的护士简单地介绍了病区的情况和操作规范，换上防护服的冯亮就正式接手了。
The local nurse briefly introduced the situation and operation standard of the disease area. Feng Liang, who changed into a protective suit, took over.
冯亮告诉记者，来武汉之前就已经听说了医院有超负荷工作的情况，“像给我们指导的护士，白天也在新建的病区帮忙，晚上又和我们一起上了夜班，等于是没有休息”。
Feng Liang told reporters that before coming to Wuhan, he had heard about the overload at the hospital. "Like the nurse who directed us, he helped us in the newly-built sick area during the day and worked night shifts with us at night.
起初，冯亮他们是按照上海的方式是采用三班倒，但后来大家觉得，这样的疲劳战不能长久，就对排班进行了调整。
Initially, Feng Liang followed the Shanghai pattern of triple shifting, but later it was felt that the fatigue would not last and the shift was adjusted.
“我们这里暂时是6个小时一班，分成4班，每班进到病房直接护理病人的有8个人。
"We are on a six-hour shift, divided into four shifts, with eight people coming in each shift to take direct care of the patients.
外围的话晚上有两个，白天保证三四个。
Two at night, three or four during the day.
”冯亮说，“后来领导建议能不能换成4个小时一班，怕我们在里面时间太长。
Feng Liang said: "Later the leader suggested that we could change to a four-hour shift for fear that we would spend too much time inside.
但问题是物资其实还是比较紧张的，如果增加班次等于要多16套防护装备。
But the problem is that the material is still relatively tense, if the increase in the number of shifts equal to 16 additional sets of protective equipment.
因为我们不可能减少每班的人数，不然护理质量肯定就达不到上海对护理病人的质量的要求。
Because we can not reduce the number of people per class, otherwise the quality of care will certainly not meet Shanghai's requirements for the quality of care for patients.
”冯亮告诉记者，危重病房里没有护工，病人所有的治疗和吃喝拉撒都是由护士来承担，很多病人还伴有腹泻的症状，“我不可能一边帮病人做治疗，一边再给他倒扁马桶，这样也不符合无菌的原则”。
"Feng Liang told reporters that there were no nurses in the critically ill room and that all treatment, food and rasa were provided by nurses. Many patients also had diarrheal symptoms.
冯亮在病房穿着厚重的防护服　受访者供图虽然在冯亮负责的病区，物资并没有网传的那么紧缺，更没有到了需要医护人员自己diy护具的地步，“那些都是谣言，如果没有正规的防护服，医院也不会让我们进病房的”，但其实物资还是相对有限的。
Feng Liang in the ward wearing heavy protective clothing interviewees Although in FengLiang responsible for the disease area, supplies are not as tight as the network, not to mention the need for medical personnel their own diy protective equipment, "those are rumors, without formal protective clothing, hospitals will not let us into the ward," but the material is still relatively limited.
“因为我们面对的病人病情比较重，进去的护理人员比较多，物资就会比其他地方消耗多一些。
"Because the patients we're dealing with are very sick, we have more paramedics in and more supplies are consumed than anywhere else.
”冯亮说，虽然中间可以从病房出来，但这样就浪费一套防护服了，“工作的六个小时，我们基本上是不喝水的，可以坚持不出病房”。
Feng Liang said that while it was possible to get out of the room in the middle, it was a waste of protective clothing. "We basically didn't drink water during the six hours we worked, so we couldn't get out of the room.
长时间戴着护目镜，在医护人员的鼻梁和面部留下了深深的压痕，甚至是压伤　图片来源于网络事实上，穿着厚实的防护服，戴着口罩、帽子、护目镜是非常闷热的。
Wear goggles for long periods of time, leaving deep indentations on the nose and face of paramedics, and even images of bruises coming from the Internet. In fact, wearing thick protective clothing, masks, hats, goggles is very sultry.
“光是穿脱就要一些时间，很多照片里医护人员脸上的压痕也都是经常会有的，我们叫它压创。
"It takes some time just to wear it out, and in many of the pictures there are lots of pressure marks on the faces of the paramedics, and we call it bruising.
”冯亮说，尤其是男孩子更容易出汗，“我们一个男同事，下了班，汗水是可以直接从鞋子里倒出来的”。
Boys in particular are more prone to sweating, says Feng. "One of our male colleagues, off the shift, sweats can be poured out of shoes."
也正是因为有了充分的防护，至今，上海医疗队所在的病区并无一例医护人员感染的情况。
Because of the adequate protection, so far, the Shanghai medical team is located in the disease area there is not a single case of infection by medical staff.
而一切辛苦都是值得的，冯亮说，每当看着危重病区的患者有好转转出，是他们最欣慰的时刻，“就是在心里觉得我们的付出还是起到了一定的作用”。
And all the hard work is worth it, said Feng Liang, every time the patients in the critical area to see a good turn out, is their most gratifying moment, "it is in the heart feel that our pay or played a role.
不愿和家里通话，怕情绪绷不住来武汉一个多星期的时间里，冯亮说，只和家里打过一次视频电话，平时更多是通过文字和家里联系，“就是比较想小孩，打电话的话可能会有一点点情绪上的失控”。
FengLiang said that he had made only one video phone call with his family, and that he was more likely to communicate with his family via text messages. "It's just a little bit out of control if you want to talk to your children.
某天工作间隙，同班的男护士问冯亮回去后第一件事想做什么，她脱口而出：“抱着儿子狂亲一顿。
One day during the break, the male nurse in the class asked Feng Liang what he wanted to do the first thing he wanted to do.
”但转念一想，又不行，还得隔离一段时间。
"But then, on second thought, I couldn't, and had to be isolated for some time.
冯亮说，当时说到这里眼泪已经在眼眶里打转，“这个话题就没有继续下去，因为不能哭，护目镜会起雾，而且流眼泪的话，也可能会有污染。
"At that point, the tears began to well up in her eyes." The topic didn't go on, because we can't cry, the goggles get foggy, and tears can get dirty, "Feng said.
”冯亮的小儿子魏鸿也会做事了，给太太热饭，喂太太喝水　受访者供图后来冯亮在吃饭的时候，继续了这个话题，她问了那个男同事他回去第一件事要做什么。
Feng Liang's youngest son, Wei Hong, would do the same, warming up his wife and feeding her a drink. "Later Feng Liang continued the topic at dinner and asked the male colleague what he would do first thing on his way back.
“他回答我说想去吃火锅，因为吃火锅的时候是比较热闹的，就是一堆人围在一起，有吃年夜饭的感觉。
"He replied that he wanted to eat hot pot, because when eating hotpot is more lively, is a group of people together, there is the feeling of eating New Year's Eve.
其实我觉得他也是有点想家了。
Actually, I think he's a little homesick.
”说到此处，冯亮有些哽咽。
"Feng Liang sobbed as he spoke.
稳定了情绪之后，冯亮又聊回了工作。
After stabilizing the mood, Feng Liang chatted back to work.
她说，之后他们会研究出更合理的排班，来保证医护人员足够的休息，“只有我们休息好了，才能更好地护理病人”。
She said they would then work out a more reasonable schedule to ensure adequate rest for health-care workers. "Only if we rest well can we better care for the sick."
采访结束的当天，冯亮给记者发来了微信，她说儿子的信后来她看了，“感觉他长大了，希望他会理解我的行为，也希望我的行为能引发他对未来的思考，学习是为了什么，将来想要成为怎样的人”。
The day of the interview, Feng Liang sent a message to reporters, she said her son's letter later she read, "I feel he has grown up, I hope he will understand my behavior, but also hope that my behavior will trigger his thinking about the future, what learning is for, what kind of person he wants to be."
Play两个儿子录了视频让冯亮放心“有了这样的榜样，魏诚和魏鸿一定不会辜负你的期待。
"With such an example, Wei Cheng and Wei Hong will surely live up to your expectations," said Feng.
”记者给冯亮回了微信。
The reporter returned the letter to Feng Liang.
