你印象中的武汉是什么样的？这座位于华中地区的省会城市充满着生命力，夏天够热，热干面是他们最常见的美食，闲下来的老人们会聚在街头巷尾打牌，春节是他们最热闹的节日，有归乡的年轻人，有早早就置办年货的老人，有火红的对联和热情的拜年。
This capital city in central China is full of vitality, hot summer, hot and dry noodles are their most common food, idle old people will gather at the end of the streets and play cards, Spring Festival is their most popular holiday, there are young people back home, there are early purchase of New Year goods, red couplets and warm New Year.
2020 年春天，武汉人的春节是灰色的。
In spring 2020, Wuhan people's Spring Festival is gray.
新冠病毒的肆虐把他们原本的闲逸生活摔在地上打了个粉碎。
The onslaught of the new crown virus shattered their otherwise idle lives on the ground.
我们努力地找到了几个武汉人，他们跟我们讲述了他们从疫情开始至今的生活变化。
We managed to find a few Wuhan people who told us about the changes in their lives since the outbreak began.
他们是幸运儿，毕竟身处这座城市之中，「生死之外，皆是小事」。
They are lucky, after all, in this city, "life and death, all is a small matter."
接受我们采访的三个人截至目前都没有成为这次新冠病毒的携带者，他们幸运地以各种各样的方式逃过了这一劫。
None of the three people we interviewed have been carriers of the new crown virus so far, and they have been lucky enough to escape in a variety of ways.
他们当中有孕晚期的准妈妈，有不得不被隔离在工作城市一个人过节的武汉女孩，有回到老家便不得不隔离的北漂男孩。
Among them are expectant mothers-to-be, Wuhan girls who have to be quarantined in the city where they work, and boys who have to be quarantined when they return home.
他们见证了这一个月的城市变化，我们记录下他们的故事，也带大家看看一个武汉普通人在这个一波三折的春节里的不平凡生活。
They witnessed the city changes this month, we recorded their stories, but also take a look at the ordinary Wuhan people in this ups and downs of the Spring Festival extraordinary life.
三个人都与我们说过同样的话：「2020 年的春节，我可能一辈子都忘不掉。
All three said the same thing to us: "2020 Spring Festival, I will probably never forget.
」 被封城外的武汉人小李女武汉人、未感染29 岁深圳互联网公司员工深圳工作 3 个月，个人收入不详大年初七，武汉女孩小李就开始在她深圳的家里办工了。
Wuhan wuhan wuhan, wuhan woman, not infected 29-year-old shenzhen internet company staff work for 3 months, personal income unknown, wuhan girl xiao li began her home in shenzhen.
当大多数公司都在为这场瘟疫导致的停工叫苦不迭时，她所在的这家位于深圳，主打网络游戏的公司却迎来了最大的红利期：宅在家里的人太多，大多数人会选择靠网络游戏打发时光。
While most companies bemoan the pestilence-induced stoppage, her Shenzhen-based online-games company is enjoying its biggest dividend: too many people are staying at home and most people are choosing to spend their time online.
「只是因为北京上海深圳等大城市的人员流动性太大，我们去公司办公的时间还没法确定。
"Just because people are so mobile in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen, we can't be sure when we will go to the office.
」从计划的初七上班延长到 2 月 3 日上班，再变到 2 月 10 日上班，再到现在的「去公司办公的时间待定」，小李不得不在深圳的家里简单搭了一个办公位完成日常工作，可她却总是魂不守舍。
"From the planned 7 days to work on February 3, change to February 10 to work, and now" time to work in the company to be determined, "Xiao Li had to put up a simple office space at her home in Shenzhen to complete her daily duties, but she was always in a panic.
因为买不到口罩，如今小李只能把本应几小时一换的防护口罩在用后晒起来消毒，准备第二次使用。
Unable to buy a mask, Xiao Li can only use the mask, which should have been changed for a few hours, to dry and disinfect it for a second time.
可这样的事她不敢告诉自己远在武汉的父母在深圳街头，你随处都可以看到「来了就是深圳人」的横幅标语，这个年轻的城市人头攒动，热情洋溢，随时欢迎外来的人们来建设它。
But such things she did not dare to tell her parents in Wuhan in the streets of Shenzhen, you can see everywhere "Come is Shenzhen" banner, this young city people swarmed, enthusiastic, always welcome foreign people to build it.
武汉女孩小李才来这座城市 3 个月，租住在一间不大的房子里。
Wuhan girl Xiao Li came to the city for three months and rented in a small house.
90 后的她与男朋友同是武汉人，还没结婚，养了 2 只猫。
After 90, she and her boyfriend are Wuhan people, has not married, has two cats.
这座城市生活节奏快，工作机会多，两个年轻人又都不怕苦累加班，所以月薪都不错，跟大多数情侣一样，过着自给自足的小日子。
The city has a fast pace of life, lots of jobs and two young people who are not afraid to work long hours, so they make a good monthly salary and, like most couples, live self-sufficient lives.
小李原本算是最早嗅到一丝丝不寻常气息的人之一。
Xiao Li was one of the first to smell anything unusual.
12 月末，格外关注家乡信息的她在网上看到了一则关于华南海鲜市场发现不明肺炎患者的消息，她读完了全篇内容，并把这则报道转发给了在武汉的父母。
At the end of December, she read an article about the discovery of unknown pneumonia in the South China seafood market on the Internet. She read the whole story and forwarded it to her parents in Wuhan.
她转发的消息并没有引起家人的重视，因为从元旦开始一直到一月中下旬的时间，关于「武汉肺炎」的消息就突然人间蒸发一般不见了踪影，没有人再提起这件事。
The news she relayed did not attract the attention of her family, for from New Year's Day until late January, the news of Wuhan Pneumonia disappeared and no one mentioned it again.
「也许是假的吧……」当时的她心怀侥幸。
"Maybe it was a fake..." She was lucky.
为了回家过年，男朋友在 1 月 17 日一早就乘飞机回了武汉，小李则因为公司还有工作没有完成，要多在深圳留几天。
In order to go home for the New Year, my boyfriend flew back to Wuhan on January 17, while Xiao Li stayed in Shenzhen for a few more days because his company still had unfinished business.
就在男朋友回老家的当天，小李在新闻中看到日本出现了一个肺炎感染病例，患者是从武汉返回日本的。
On the day of his boyfriend's return home, Xiao Li saw on the news a case of pneumonia in Japan, the patient returned from Wuhan.
仅仅一天之后，她在朋友圈刷到自己在武汉某医院工作的朋友穿着全套防护服诊疗的图片。
Just a day later, she brushed pictures of her friends working in a Wuhan hospital in full protective clothing.
再隔一天，微博上开始出现了不少定位为武汉的求救信息。
The next day, Weibo began to appear a lot of positioning for the help of Wuhan information.
她连给父母发了几条消息，提醒他们出门务必戴口罩，做好防护。
She even sent several messages to her parents reminding them to wear masks and protect themselves when they went out.
小李问她已在家乡的男朋友武汉现在的情况怎么样，男朋友沉吟半晌，说：「今年我们怕是不能去归元寺数罗汉了。
Xiao Li asked her boyfriend in his hometown, Wuhan, how things are now. He said, "We are afraid we can't go to Guiyuan Temple to count Luohan this year.
」去归元寺数罗汉是传统武汉人的风俗习惯，这样的传统延续了一代又一代，年轻人至今也愿意在每年春节去热热闹闹的归元寺数罗汉，看自己未来一年的运势，图个大吉大利。
The tradition of going to Guiyuan Temple to count the Rohan is a tradition which has been carried on from generation to generation. The young people are still willing to go to Guiyuan Temple every year to count Luohan and see how lucky they are in the coming year.
「每年过年的归元寺总是人山人海，我不能想象一个不去数罗汉的春节，也很难想象归元寺冷冷清清的样子。
"Every year Guiyuan Temple is always crowded with people, I can not imagine a not counting Luohan Spring Festival, and it is difficult to imagine the desolate appearance of Guiyuan Temple.
」小李这样说：「当时我并不知道这件事情会如何发展，这是我们第一次遇到这种疾病，大多数人也都不知道这种肺炎究竟会严重到什么程度。
"I didn't know how it was going to happen," Li said. "It was the first time we had the disease and most people had no idea how serious it would be.
当时我还觉得男朋友说得夸张，我说等我回去，咱俩戴上口罩去归元寺就没事了。
I thought my boyfriend was exaggerating, and I said that when I got back, we would put on masks and go to the temple.
」那几天的口罩价格也让小李感到有些异样：「20 日，看到官方通报武汉发现了 17 例患者之后，我马上下单了一些医用口罩，准备回家的时候带回去。
The prices of the masks changed a little over the past few days. "On the 20th, I ordered some medical masks as soon as I saw the official announcement that Wuhan had discovered 17 cases.
21 日，官方通报一例患者死亡，我看到消息的时候是上午 10 点，我立马在京东买了两盒 N95 口罩，一盒填了武汉老家的地址，一盒寄到我现在住的深圳这里。
When I saw the news, I immediately bought two boxes of N95 masks in Jingdong. One box filled in the address of my hometown in Wuhan, and one box was sent to here in Shenzhen, where I now live.
」小李下单的时候，3M 口罩的价格是 135 元 50 枚，中午 12 点，同样数量的一盒口罩已经卖到了 180 多块。
The price of the 3M mask was 135 yuan and 50 yuan when Xiao Li ordered it. By 12 noon, the same number of masks had been sold to more than 180.
一小时后再点击货品，上面只显示三个字：已售空。
One hour later click on the item and it shows only three words: empty.
父母给小李发来的武汉家里口罩存货也是那天，爸爸在电话里跟她说：「要是害怕你今年就别回来了。
The same day my father told Xiao Li on the phone, "If you're afraid you won't come back this year," he told her.
」从没在异乡过过春节的她还没法狠心做这个决定。
"Having never lived in a foreign country for the Spring Festival, she couldn't help making the decision.
她继续在网上下单，抢到了一批护目镜寄给老家，「武汉的情况比深圳严重嘛，老人抵抗力又弱，肯定需要更多防护。
"Wuhan is worse than Shenzhen. The old people's resistance is weak and they certainly need more protection.
」这批护目镜直到今天也没能发货，就这样直挺挺地躺在小李的手机订单里，但她不敢取消。
The goggles, unable to deliver the goods to this day, lay upright in Xiao Li's cell phone order, but she dared not cancel it.
「21 日我下班有点晚，回家路上刷微博看到有很多呼吁武汉人今年春节不要回老家的声音，包括官方渠道。
"On the 21st, I got off work a little late. On my way home, I saw many voices, including official ones, calling on Wuhan people not to return home for the Spring Festival.
我就决定不给大家添麻烦，不回家了，我以为爸妈会不开心，劝我回去，我还特地问我爸要不要先跟奶奶说一声，怕她埋怨我。
I decided not to give you any trouble, do not go home, I thought my parents will not be happy, advised me to go back, and I asked my father to tell Grandma first, afraid she would blame me.
我爸当时的语气特别斩钉截铁，说不用说，你赶紧退票，别回家了。
My father's tone was very emphatic. Needless to say, don't go home with a refund.
我从未感觉自己是个如此恋家的人，还觉得自己很叛逆，总嫌弃父母唠叨，可我爸说你别回来了的时候，我眼泪一下子就下来了。
I never felt like such a homebody, I thought I was rebellious and always hated my parents' nagging, but when my dad said you shouldn't come back, my tears just came down.
」23 日凌晨，官方宣布灾情最严重的武汉封城，她真的回不去了。
"In the early morning hours of the 23rd, authorities announced that Wuhan, the worst hit city, would not be able to go back.
2020 年 1 月 24 日，除夕夜，武汉女孩小李在她深圳的出租屋里，独自一人迎来了人生中第一个哭着过的春节。
On January 24, 2020, Wuhan girl Xiao Li in her Shenzhen rental house, alone ushered in life's first crying Spring Festival.
除夕那天，小李一个人在深圳过，她点的星巴克咖啡上被店员写了：新年快乐「那几天我每天都哭，跟家里通电话哭，不通电话也哭。
On New Year's Eve, Xiao Li was alone in Shenzhen. The clerk wrote on the Starbucks Coffee she had ordered: "Happy New Year.
但我不敢让家里人看到，可眼泪就是止不住。
But I dare not let the family see, but the tears just can't stop.
」流泪是因为无法在灾难来临时陪伴父母的愧疚，是因为没有痛下决心早点回家的自责，是因为现在天各一方的无力，是为仍在上涨的患者数字感到崩溃，也是因为对于未来发展态势不确定的畏惧。
"Tears come from the guilt of not being able to accompany your parents when a disaster strikes, from the self-reproach of not deciding to go home earlier, from the powerlessness of each side now, from the collapse of the rising number of patients, from the fear of uncertainty about the future.
其实小李本来有机会让父母来深圳的。
In fact, Xiao Li had the opportunity to let his parents come to Shenzhen.
「20 日前后，我觉得态势不对，就跟我爸妈说，不然我给你们买机票，你们来深圳吧。
"About 20 days ago, I thought the situation is not right, just tell my parents, or I will buy you tickets, you come to Shenzhen.
可我爸说，奶奶自己在家没人照顾可不行。
But my dad said it wouldn't do for Grandma to be left alone at home.
这倒确实是个问题，就算我当时接来了爸爸妈妈，奶奶那么大年纪了肯定只能留在家里，现在疫情这么严重，她一个人肯定不行的，我们在深圳反而会更担心她。
This is a real problem, even if I took over my parents, grandmother's age must have to stay at home, now that the outbreak of such a serious, she can not be alone, we will be more worried about her in Shenzhen.
」今年陪小李过春节的，是一堆玩偶和两只猫如今这个家庭又面临新的挑战。
With Xiao Li celebrating the Spring Festival this year, a bunch of dolls and two cats are now facing new challenges for the family.
小李的父母都是公务员，单位提倡公务员必须在第一时间复工，冲在一线。
Xiao Li's parents are civil servants, the unit advocates that civil servants must return to work at the first time, rushed in the first line.
她在深圳远程揪心的事情就更多了：「武汉已经买不到防护服了，之后下单的酒精和消毒液根本不见发货，家里的口罩也在不停地消耗。
"Wuhan can no longer buy protective clothing, after the order of alcohol and disinfectant can not be delivered at all, the family mask is constantly consumed.
城市里还是每天都有人倒下，我不知道能怎么保护他们，家人中如果有一个人染病，我可能真的会疯掉。
People still fall every day in the city. I don't know how to protect them. If one of my family gets sick, I may go crazy.
」小李用「市井」和「坚韧」形容传统的武汉人：「比如他们自发组织的推开窗子各自喊出『武汉加油』这样的口号，这是他们当时唯一能做的。
"Xiao Li used the terms" market well "and" tenacity "to describe the traditional Wuhan people:" For example, they spontaneously organized to open windows and shouted slogans such as "Wuhan refueling," which was the only thing they could do.
别看我是武汉人，但我不在武汉，我也没有他们此时此刻的感同身受。
Although I am Wuhan, but I am not in Wuhan, I do not have their feelings at this moment.
经历这么大的灾难，他们一定需要一个渠道来舒缓自己的内心，喊出来可能会帮助他们发泄心中的压抑、恐惧和悲观。
After such a disaster, they must have a channel to soothe their inner feelings, and shouting might help them vent their depression, fear and pessimism.
」如今身在异乡的她只能随时用微信跟父母联系，多数时候是视频电话，叮嘱他们测体温，开窗通风，出门做好一切防护。
Now in a foreign country, she can only contact her parents by microphone, most of the time by video phone, telling them to take their temperature, air their windows and go out to do everything possible to protect themselves.
「这时候父母反而在宽慰我，告诉我一切都挺好，怕我担心。
"Instead, my parents were comforting me and telling me that everything was fine for fear that I should worry.
我就觉得特别对不起他们，这时候我应该站在他们面前，保护他们来着。
I feel especially sorry for them. I should be standing in front of them and protecting them.
」跟她频繁地落泪不同，父母在视频里倒是常对她笑，给她看当天晚上做的晚餐，让女儿放心，家里一切正常。
"Unlike her, who cried so often, her parents often laughed at her in the video, showing her the evening's dinner and reassuring her that everything was okay at home.
「只要武汉一解禁，我无论如何都会第一时间飞回去看他们，跟他们在一起。
"As soon as Wuhan is released, I will fly back to see them and stay with them at any time.
」说到这里，她又哭了。
"Then she began to cry again.
今年是小李 29 岁的人生中第一次在异乡过年，为了保持一点过年的仪式感，她特地买了一副对联贴在大门上。
In order to maintain a sense of ceremony, Xiao Li bought a pair of couplets and put them on the door for the first time.
跟往年的「新年大吉」和「恭喜发财」不同，今年她选的对联上写着：阖家欢乐。
Unlike previous New Year's Eve celebrations and "Congratulation," the couplet she chose this year read, "Happy Family.
