“人力短缺是最直接和最普遍的问题”2月18日晚18点15分，从安徽黄山北站开往杭州东的D5580车次准时出发。
"Manpower shortage is the most immediate and common problem." At 18: 15 pm on Feb. 18, train D5580 from Huangshan North Station in Anhui Province to Hangzhou East will depart on time.
这是一趟为杭州复工人员定制的“复工专列”，车上的543名乘客全都是返杭就业人员，他们是当前杭州企业急需的“宝贵资源”。
This is a custom-made "back to work train" for Hangzhou workers, the 543 passengers are all returned to Hangzhou employed people, they are now urgently needed by enterprises in Hangzhou "precious resources."
这已经是杭州启动的第三趟复工专列。
This is already the third time Hangzhou has started back to work train.
2月16日13时57分，全国铁路首趟定制务工人员返程专列从贵阳北站开出，近300名贵州籍外出务工人员从贵阳北站乘坐G4138次动车组列车前往杭州。
On February 16, at 1357 hours, the first special train for Chinese railway workers returned from Guiyang North Station, and nearly 300 Guizhou emigrants from Guiyang Station went to Hangzhou by train No. G4138.
第二趟专列G4391次于2月17日上午9点30分从成都东站驶出，专门为川籍务工人员返程而加开。
The second train, G4391, left from Chengdu East Station at 9.30 a.m. on February 17 and was specially opened for the return of Sichuan migrant workers.
杭州市经信局相关工作人员告诉《中国新闻周刊》，杭州当前疫情相对稳定，全市都在加快复工，经信局在走访企业过程中了解到，“人力短缺是最直接和最普遍的问题”。
Hangzhou is now relatively stable and the city is speeding up work, according to relevant staff of Hangzhou Economic Information Bureau. During a visit to the enterprise, the bureau learned that "manpower shortage is the most immediate and widespread problem."
为了加快员工返程，复工专列被提上了日程。
In order to speed up the return of staff, back to work train has been put on the agenda.
从2月16日开始，杭州以每天一辆列车的速度，从来杭就业人员集中的贵州、四川、安徽等部分省市开启免费专列。
Starting from February 16, Hangzhou will open free special trains at the rate of one train a day from Guizhou, Sichuan and Anhui provinces, where most of the employed are concentrated.
“包邮接人”模式从黄山北站到杭州东站，乘坐高铁平时只需要1小时52分钟。
From Huangshan North Station to Hangzhou East Station, it takes only 1 hour and 52 minutes to take the high-speed train.
然而，最近由于新型冠状病毒疫情的影响，全国部分列车停运，不少地区封村、封路、封区以抵抗疫情。
Recently, however, due to the impact of the new coronavirus epidemic, some of the country's trains were stopped, many areas closed villages, roads, sealed areas to resist the epidemic.
病毒被狙击的同时，员工难回，企业难开工。
While the virus is sniper, employees are difficult to return to, the enterprise difficult to start.
杭州此前为支持复工还出台了很多专项政策。
Hangzhou has also issued a number of special policies to support the resumption of work.
比如，2月12日，杭州就已经发布了降低企业融资成本、免收企业担保费、用减免企业房租等12条企业复工复产政策。
On February 12, Hangzhou, for example, announced a plan to reduce the cost of financing businesses, exempt businesses from paying premiums, and reduce or reduce corporate rents.
企业在获得实惠的同时，却面临着着无人干活的尴尬境地。
Enterprises in the access to benefits, but also face the embarrassing situation of no one to work.
杭州此次行动，主要由杭州市经信委和杭州市人社局两个部门来负责。
Hangzhou this action, mainly by Hangzhou Economic Letter Committee and Hangzhou people's bureau to be responsible for the two departments.
杭州市经信委告诉《中国新闻周刊》，经信委跟企业联系最紧密，企业这几天希望有多少员工到岗，把需求报上来，“我们统一汇总后，再排一排返工人员哪个出行时间最集中，最后才决定了开通16号贵阳这趟专列。
Hangzhou Economy Letter Committee told China News Weekly that the letter committee is the most closely connected with enterprises. How many employees do enterprises expect to be on duty these days and report the demand?
”之所以选择这些地区，是因为杭州的企业员工老家比较集中在贵州、四川等几个地区。
"The reason for choosing these areas is that Hangzhou's enterprise employees come from places such as Guizhou and Sichuan.
此外，像贵州黔东南州还是杭州对口支援的地区，黔东南州人社局配合杭州做了大量工作，黔东南州人社局将乘坐专列的复工人员信息发送给各区县人社局，对复工人员提供接站服务。
In addition, the Qiandongnan Prefecture, Guizhou, and the corresponding support area of Hangzhou have done a lot of work in collaboration with Hangzhou, and the Qiandongnan People's Bureau has sent the special information about returning workers to the district and county social bureau to provide pick-up service for the returning workers.
对于杭州经信委来说，这是一个工作量极大的任务。
For the Hangzhou Economic and Communications Commission, this is a very heavy workload.
为了协调安排这些人的出行计划，他们需要逐个打电话，通知务工人员，告知车次信息，询问他们能不能不赶得上专列，“他们大都在周边的区县，赶到车站需要时间，最后统计的是能够按时赶到又符合防疫条件的人员。
In order to coordinate their travel plans, they need to call the workers one by one, inform them of the train numbers and ask them if they can not catch the train. "They are mostly in the surrounding districts and counties.
”杭州经信委负责此次行动的工作人员只有5个人，而第一辆复工专列人数近300人，但实际打电话通知的人远超这个数量，“实际联系的人数差不多有1200人左右，有很多人来不了。
The Hangzhou Economic and Communications Commission had only five staff members in charge of the operation, and the first reinstated train numbered nearly 300, but the actual number of calls far exceeded that number. "The actual number of people contacted was about 1,200 and many could not be reached.
”杭州经信委一位工作人员感叹：“这其实是一个不得已的笨办法。
A staff member of the Hangzhou Economic and Communications Commission lamented: "This is in fact a clumsy way out of necessity.
”不过，已经有一些用工人数比较多的企业，开始直接去对接务工人员信息，再反馈给经信委，“这样能稍微减轻一点我们的工作压力。
However, there are already companies with large numbers of employees that have started docking workers' information directly and giving it back to the ECC, "which is a bit less stressful.
”此次复工专列，由杭州市政府统一协调和承担费用，乘坐复工专列人员的交通费用全免。
"The re-entry train, coordinated and paid for by the Hangzhou Municipal Government, will be free of charge.
从上车到下车，这些复工人员也能享受全程“定制服务”。
From boarding to getting off, these workers can also enjoy the entire "customized service."
从贵州各地赶来的务工人员，按时赶到车站后，凭身份证就能进站了。
Guizhou from all over the workers, on time arrived at the station, with identity cards can enter the station.
上海铁路局杭州站相关工作人员告诉《中国新闻周刊》，专列从始发站到终点站，沿途会在一些站点短暂停车，但不上下客。
Shanghai Railway Bureau Hangzhou Railway Station staff told China News Weekly that the train stops from the departure station to the terminus, stopping briefly at some stations along the way, but not loading or unloading passengers.
列车到站后，杭州市人社局和各区人社部门都会到站迎接。
After the train arrives at the station, Hangzhou people's social bureau and human society departments will meet at the station.
在高铁站，这些下车的乘客还收到了一个礼包——里面装着面包、牛奶等食物和口罩。
At the high-speed rail station, the disembarking passengers also received a package containing bread, milk and other food and masks.
此次复工专列主要针对两方面人员：一是企业原有节前返工人员，二是企业在外地新招聘人员。
The resumption of work train mainly for two aspects of personnel: first, the original enterprise before the rework, and second, enterprises in the field of new recruits.
乘坐专列返杭的员工须持有杭州健康绿码，且没有发烧、咳嗽、呼吸不畅等疑似新冠肺炎症状。
Returning to Hangzhou by train must hold Hangzhou healthy green code, and there is no fever, cough, shortness of breath and other suspected symptoms of new crown pneumonia.
而且，申请专列返杭的企业，须能够妥善解决员工的住宿问题。
Furthermore, enterprises applying for special trains to return to Hangzhou must be able to properly address the issue of staff accommodation.
健康码是杭州率先推出的基于数字化能力的健康评估证明，可作为疫情期间复工人员流动的通行凭证。
Health code is based on the digital ability of Hangzhou-based health assessment certificate, can be used to resume the movement of workers during the epidemic.
2月11日杭州市率先实施，领取绿码的人员凭码通行，领取红码和黄码的人员需按规定隔离并健康打卡，满足条件后将转为绿码。
Hangzhou City on February 11 to take the lead in the implementation of the green code with the code, the red and yellow code recipients must be segregated and health card, the conditions will be converted to green code.
专列审批从15天压缩到20小时2月15日，国务院联防联控机制举办的新闻发布会，国铁集团副总经理李文新介绍，原来预计春运节后的铁路客流是2.8亿人次，从2月11日起，铁路发送旅客已经连续4天低于100万人次，累计退票达到1.15亿张。
According to Li Wenxin, deputy general manager of the China Railway Group, railway passenger flow after the Spring Festival was expected to be 280 million. Since Feb. 11, railway passenger traffic has been running for less than one million consecutive days, with a total of 115 million refunds.
国铁集团为了解决企业复工难问题，首次公开提出开通专列的意见。
China Railway Group to solve the difficulties of enterprises back to work, the first time to open the opinion of the train.
李文新表示：“我们现在的客座能力最大的是800万一天，如果按照50%的客座率，至少能够满足日均400万人次出行，而目前旅客出行的需求在100万以内，对于输入和输出地比较集中的务工团体客流，我们还可以组织专列或者包车形式，确保有序错峰返程。
"We now have the biggest guest capacity of 8m days and if we can meet at least 4m trips per day with a 50 per cent passenger rate, the current demand for passengers is within 1m," Mr Li said. "We can also organise special trains or charters to ensure an orderly staggered return journey.
”上海分局杭州站相关工作人员告诉《中国新闻周刊》：“我们铁路公司是有运力的，只要对方有这个需求，完全可以配合来做这个事情。
"Our railway company is capable of doing this as long as there is a demand for it," the Shanghai branch office in Hangzhou told China News Weekly.
政府把需求报给我们，然后再通知和安排好复工人员，这需要信息双向畅通。
The government informs us of the requirements and then notifies and arranges for the reinstated workers, which requires a two-way flow of information.
”上述人员介绍，正常来说，春运等节假日加开列车，必须提前15天进行申报。
"Normally, Spring Festival couriers and other holidays must be announced 15 days in advance, the people said.
现在，整个流程压缩至不到20个小时。
The entire process is now compressed into less than 20 hours.
从杭州到贵州、四川，再到铁路部门，各方高效运作，促进了全国首辆复工专列的发车。
From Hangzhou to Guizhou, Sichuan and then to the railway sector, the parties operated efficiently, promoting the first train to start again.
为最大程度地避免疫情传播风险，此次杭州复工人员专制列车是在中国国家铁路集团的统筹协调下，跟中国铁路上海局、成都局多方制定的复工人员专列开行方案，完善旅客进站、候车、乘车、出站等环节的疫情防控和客运服务措施。
In order to minimize the risk of spreading the epidemic, this autocratic train for returning workers in Hangzhou is a multi-party plan with China Railway Shanghai Bureau and Chengdu Bureau, under the overall coordination of China National Railway Group.
在贵阳北站，特别设立了绿色通道指定专人引导务工人员进站，安排30余人共12台设备加强体温检测，并设置专门候车区让务工人员分散就坐。
In Guiyang North Station, a special designated person was set up to guide the green passage workers into the station, arrange a total of more than 30 people 12 equipment to enhance temperature testing, and set up special waiting areas for workers to sit scattered.
目前，苏州也紧跟杭州，准备加入到复工专列的行列中来。
At present, Suzhou also closely follows Hangzhou and is ready to join the ranks of reinstated workers.
首批次专列拟定安徽省六安市、河南省商丘市方向，后续返苏复工专列开通的班次和方向，将根据企业的需求信息进行调整。
The first special train is designed for the direction of Liuan city in Anhui Province and Shangqiu City in Henan Province.
不过，杭州市人社局一位工作人员也告诉《中国新闻周刊》：“复工专列这项工作比较庞杂，未来具体操作方式可能会有变化。
However, a staff member of Hangzhou Municipal People's Bureau also told China News Weekly: "The job of returning to work is quite complicated, and the mode of operation may change in the future.
”各地送出大礼包一手抓疫情防控，一手抓企业复工复产，是很多地方当前的紧迫任务。
"It is an urgent task in many places to give large gifts to prevent and control the epidemic and to resume production at the same time.
中国城市和小城镇改革发展中心首席经济学家李铁近日发文称：“建议各级政府的主官们要有敢于承担风险的意识，最大化的提高科学防控的方法和手段。
"It is recommended that government officials at all levels have the courage to take risks and maximize the ways and means to improve scientific control," Li Tie, chief economist at the Center for the Reform and Development of Cities and Small Towns in China, said in a statement
只有干部的恐惧心理降低了，社会的过度恐慌才有可能被缓解。
Only when the fear of cadres is reduced can the excessive panic of society be alleviated.
希望在疫情并不严重并已经达到了充分防控效果的城市，在提高防控能力和手段的同时，自主及时复工、开业，恢复正常经济和社会生活。
It is hoped that in cities where the epidemic is not serious and has achieved sufficient control and prevention effects, work will resume and begin operations in a timely manner and resume normal economic and social life, while improving the capacity and means for prevention and control.
”除了杭州，浙江各地都出台了很多针对复工人员的“大礼包”，用专机、专列、专车等各种方式接送复工人员。
In addition to Hangzhou, Zhejiang provinces have introduced many "big gift bags" for returning workers, using special planes, trains and buses to transport them.
