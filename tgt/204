I know exactly who sat at home, who played Mahjong, who was playing Mahjong, who came back from Wuhan, and who came back from Wuhan.
”电话中，袁少敏自信满满地对《棱镜》表示。
On the phone, Yuan Shaomin confidently told Prism.
袁少敏是湖北省孝感市陡岗镇袁湖村村支书。
Yuan Shaomin is a village branch of Xiaogan Town, Hubei Province.
孝感毗邻武汉，交通便捷且人员来往密切，而袁湖村距孝感城区仅3-4公里。
Filial piety is close to Wuhan, with convenient transportation and close contact with people, while Yuan Lake is only 3-4 kilometers away from Xiaoyan City.
因此，疫情防控难度和压力巨大。
Therefore, the prevention and control of the epidemic is difficult and stressful.
截至2月1日，孝感市累计报告新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊病例达749例，累计追踪密切接触者5428人，尚在接受医学观察5066人。
As of February 1, 2007, a total of 749 confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia have been reported in Xiaogan City.
据统计，袁湖村有1600位村民，从武汉返乡者有40人。
According to statistics, there are 1,600 villagers in Yuan Lake and 40 returnees from Wuhan.
不仅如此，村里不少人在孝感市区买房，频繁在村里和城区往返。
Not only that, many people in the village in Xiaogan District to buy a house, frequently in the village and urban areas.
“今天是封村第九天，我们村没有疑似和确诊病例。
"Today is the ninth day of the village. We have no suspected or confirmed cases.
但我们不能放松警惕。
But we cannot let our guard down.
”2月2日，袁少敏对《棱镜》介绍说。
Yuan Shaomin told Prism on February 2.
这样的结果在当下并不容易。
Such an outcome is not easy at the moment.
不仅是袁湖村，湖北乃至河南等多地的乡村都面临类似的局面：从武汉返乡人口众多，村民对疫情危害认识不足，人情大过天，使得这些乡村成为当前防疫工作的重点和难点。
Not only Yuan Hucun, Hubei and even Henan villages are faced with a similar situation: from Wuhan to return home a large number of people, villagers have insufficient awareness of the disease hazards, human relations, so that these villages become the current focus and difficult epidemic prevention work.
“从封村后的不理解，杂音不断和矛盾冲突不断，经过几天来的教育、劝说等方式，在这两天，村庄终于安静了不少。
"After days of education and persuasion, the village was finally quiet after a few days of incomprehension, constant murmur and conflict.
”袁少敏说。
"Yuan Shaomin said.
袁少敏会把每天的见闻感悟都发在朋友圈里。
Yuan Shao-min will be the daily experience in the circle of friends.
通过与袁少敏的交流和阅读他的防疫“日记”，可以一窥真实的乡土中国。
Through the exchange with Yuan Shaomin and reading his epidemic prevention "diary," you can have a glimpse of the real local China.
“今天是封村的第八天，成效慢慢显现，还希望大家保持安静，坚持七天。
"Today is the eighth day of the village, the results slowly show, but also hope that we remain quiet, adhere to seven days.
三个村干部一伤一病（一位在前天晚上给发热病人打开绿色通道时扭伤了脚），真的希望大家安静下来。
Three village cadres were injured and sick (one sprained his foot the night before yesterday when he opened a green passage for a feverish patient) and really wanted everyone to calm down.
”2月1日，袁少敏在朋友圈写道。
On February 1, Yuan Shaomin wrote in a circle of friends.
劝说14户取消“新香”袁少敏告诉《棱镜》，孝感与武汉人流、物流来往密切。
Fourteen families were persuaded to cancel "Xinxiang" Yuan Shaomin told "Prism", filial piety and Wuhan flow of people, logistics close.
村干部在新型肺炎疫情出现后就一直保持密切关注。
Village officials have been paying close attention since the emergence of the new pneumonia epidemic.
在确认新型肺炎人传人后，村里就密集宣传要戴口罩、勤洗手。
After confirming the transmission of the new pneumonia, the village has been promoting wearing masks and washing hands frequently.
1月23日起，村里要求近期从武汉回来或途径武汉返乡的村民第一时间到村卫生室登记，检测体温并随时接受电话访问。
On January 23, villagers returning from Wuhan or returning via Wuhan were asked to register at the village clinic immediately, check their temperature and be interviewed by telephone at any time.
同时建议大家能不出去就不出去，万不得已必须出去要戴好口罩。
At the same time, it is recommended that people can not go out, absolutely have to go out to wear masks.
袁湖村返乡人员接受体温检测孝感当地有“新香”的民俗，即在大年初一，亲朋好友和家族亲戚一起祭奠前一年去世的人，人员密集且复杂。
Yuan Hu returned to the village to receive temperature testing filial piety local "new incense" folk customs, that is, in the New Year's Day, relatives and friends and family relatives together to commemorate the death of the previous year, the staff is dense and complex.
此外，往年春节期间村里拜年串门频繁。
In addition, Spring Festival in the village during frequent visits.
按照本地民俗，初一大拜年，本村家家户户间都会相互拜年；之后初二给舅舅拜年，初三给岳父岳母拜年，初四给姑爷拜年，还有诸多婚宴、寿宴密集举行。
According to local folklore, every family in our village will pay a New Year call to each other.
在看重人情面子的乡村，这些活动交叉感染风险极大。
In the face-saving countryside, these activities are at great risk of cross-infection.
为减少人员流动和人员聚集，“新香”和拜年、婚嫁等活动都要取消。
In order to reduce the mobility and concentration of people, "new incense" and New Year, marriage and other activities have to be cancelled.
“新香”最为本地人看重。
"New fragrance" most local people value.
而袁少敏的第一站，就去了本家的兄弟家做工作。
Yuan Shaomin's first stop, on the home of the brothers to do work.
当时，本家兄弟已经置办好“新香”的食材，觉得取消了面子上很难过得去。
At that time, the brothers had bought "new incense" of the ingredients, feel that the loss of face is very difficult to live.
“不搞了少花钱少受累。
"" Less money, less trouble.
万一发生了传染责任谁担得起？”袁少敏劝道，“面子上要过不去，就说是村书记不让搞。
Who can afford to bear the burden of infection? Yuan Shao-min advised. "If you want to lose face, you should say that the village secretary won't do it.
”做好本家兄弟工作后，袁少敏和村代表动员本湾（袁湖村有7个湾）其他三家也取消了“新香”，在大家最在意的”面子“问题上，袁少敏都强调：“就说村书记不让搞！”随后，大家又去其他各湾动员，共取消了14户“新香”。
Yuan Shao-min and the village representative mobilized Benwan (Yuan Lake Village has 7 Bay) to cancel the "new incense." Yuan Shao-min stressed on the question of "face" which everyone cares most: "Tell the village secretary not to do it!
随后，村里向大家宣传不串门、不拜年就顺理成章。
Subsequently, the village to everyone do not visit the door, do not visit the New Year will be logical.
袁湖村共有4家取消了婚嫁活动，3家取消了祝寿活动，其他原本计划的活动选择放弃或推迟。
A total of four marriages were canceled, three were canceled and others were abandoned or postponed.
停止本村聚集还不够。
It is not enough to stop the village gathering.
袁少敏强调，袁湖村距城区仅有3-4公里，去周边乡镇仅有2-3公里，人流极其复杂，要想防控疫情蔓延必须“封村”。
Yuan Shaomin stressed that Yuan Lake Village is only 3-4 kilometers away from the city, only 2-3 kilometers to the surrounding townships, and the flow of people is extremely complicated.
“意识到疫情的严重性后，封村是大部分村民自发要求的。
"Realizing the severity of the outbreak, most villagers spontaneously asked for the closure.
”袁少敏介绍。
Yuan Shaomin introduced.
1月25日下午和晚上，袁湖村村民就自发用泥土或树枝将全村的8个路口封住，应急通道设在村主干道。
On the afternoon and evening of January 25, the villagers of Yuan Lake spontaneously sealed off eight intersections of the village with earth or branches. The emergency passageway was located on the main village road.
袁湖村在村口设立外来人口劝返点这一举措早于当地统一要求。
Yuan Hu village in the village to set up foreign population persuasion point this initiative earlier than the local reunification requirements.
孝感市于1月27日下发通知，要求各村自1月28日起对各村出入通道实施隔断，但要求交通网络、应急运输通道和必要生产物资运输不能断。
Filial piety issued a circular on 27 January, requiring villages to cut off access to villages as of 28 January, but requiring that transport networks, emergency transport corridors and essential production materials not be cut off.
来自朋友圈的怒斥“封村”也引发了争议。
Angry "village closures" from the circle of friends have also sparked controversy.
“刚开始有村民不理解，封村的时候就有逃跑的，有扯皮的，还有人动粗。
"At first some villagers did not understand, when the village was closed, there are running away, some rip skin, and some rough.
因为有一部分人对疫情认识还不够。
Because some people don't know enough about the epidemic.
”袁少敏表示。
Mr Yuan said.
汽车不能进村，有村民就改骑摩托车、电动车往返，加大油门冲过土堆，或者把车抬过路障；有村里的老人放心不下城里的孩子，今天要去送米，明天要去送油，不是想看媳妇就是想看孙子。
There were villagers who could not get into the village and rode motorcycles and electric cars to and from the village. There were old people in the village who were worried about the city children and wanted to send rice today and oil tomorrow, either to see their wives or to see their grandchildren.
拦路用的树干在晚上被人锯断，停在村口的汽车油管被拔掉。
The trunk of the road was cut at night, and the tubing at the entrance to the village was pulled out.
还有人骑车绕道荆棘丛生、堤高坡陡的危险道路往返。
Others cycle around thorny roads and steep steep embankments to and from dangerous roads.
袁湖村用土阻隔村口，铲车在后方为应急需求待命最后综合比较，还是土堆阻隔最有效。
Yuan Lake village with soil barrier village, forklift in the rear for emergency needs on standby final comprehensive comparison, or soil barrier is the most effective.
但袁少敏强调，施工铲车在村口的应急通道待命，以应对紧急情况和生活必需品运输。
But Yuan stressed that the construction forklift in the village at the mouth of the emergency passageway standby to respond to emergencies and transportation of necessities.
“我信了你们的邪，城里这么危险，一天新增加这么多病例，躲都躲不赢，你为什么还要往城里冲进冲出，从城里冲出冲回啊！”袁少敏在朋友圈怒斥。
"I believe in you evil, the city is so dangerous, one day so many new cases, hiding can not hide, why you rushed into and out of the city rushed back ah!" Yuan Shaomin angry friends.
“从这两天来看群众举报最强烈的就是西湾有一两家三五个人，总是进进出出，东湾也有一两家，特别反映的是有个’能豆娘们’每天都来来回回（至于是哪几个人，我在这里不点名）。
"The strongest report from the two days was that there were one or two three or five people in and out of the Bay, and one or two in the East Bay, reflecting in particular the fact that a nymph comes and goes every day (as to who I am not naming here).
群众反映，这些人每天没有事进进出出，不怪我没有提醒。
The masses say that these people go in and out every day, and I am not to blame.
”在袁湖村当了25年村委书记，带领全村从“穷窝子”成为全国乡村治理示范村，袁少敏在村民中讲话有一定分量。
Yuan Shao-min served as the village secretary for 25 years, leading the village from the "poor nest" to the national model village of village governance, where Yuan Shaomin spoke with some weight.
在他朋友圈里被提到，其震慑不亚于大喇叭广播。
It was mentioned in his circle of friends as much as the loudspeaker.
在本村的七个微信群内，他和村代表们也反复强调尽量少出门。
In the village's seven micro-letter groups, he and the village representatives also repeatedly stressed that as little as possible to go out.
“我当村书记这么久没骂过人，要么不说，一旦说的话就会比较严重。
"I haven't scolded anyone for so long as I was village secretary, or, if I didn't say it, it would be more serious.
大家知道我的脾气。
Everybody knows my temper.
我也是想让大家提高意识。
I also want to raise awareness.
”袁少敏表示。
Mr Yuan said.
村民理事会担当重任形势在1月28日开始扭转。
On January 28, the situation began to reverse as the villagers' council assumed its heavy responsibilities.
袁少敏告诉《棱镜》，1月27日当天，孝感市新增新型肺炎确诊病例73例，较此前大幅上升。
Yuan Shaomin told Prism, January 27, Xiaogan City, a new type of pneumonia confirmed 73 cases, a sharp increase over the previous.
此后村民们才更加意识到身边的疫情已如此严重，为了维护自身和村民的健康，自发相互监督。
Since then, villagers have become more aware that the epidemic around them has become so serious, in order to maintain their own health and that of villagers, spontaneous mutual supervision.
近日，全国多地乡村的防疫做法引发热议，有村庄用渣土封路的，有村干部镇守村口劝退外来访客的，还有拜年时亲姥爷不给开门的。
Recently, the practice of epidemic prevention in many villages across the country triggered a heated debate, with villages sealed with dirt, some village officials guarding the entrance of the village to persuade foreign visitors, and relatives do not open the door for the New Year.
有网友称手段“硬核”，也有网友指责这些做法不够人性化，不够文明，比较low。
Some netizens said the means "hard core", but also some netizens accused these practices are not humane, not civilized enough, compare low.
“有些人根本不懂基层。
"Some people don't know anything about grass roots.
”袁少敏有些郁闷评论道，“每个村的情况都不一样，大家都在摸索自己的工作方法。
Yuan Shaomin commented gloomily, "Every village is different and everyone is groping about for its own way of working.
”他表示，村干部没有权力约束村民，要做好疫情防控，只能由村民自己认识到疫情的严重性，自发形成联防联控。
He said village officials did not have the power to restrain villagers and that only villagers themselves, aware of the severity of the outbreak, could voluntarily form a joint control system.
“要调动群众参与乡村管理的积极性，把所有人都发动起来，自发去宣传、监督。
"To mobilize the masses to participate in the enthusiasm of village management, to mobilize all the people, spontaneous publicity, supervision.
”如果没有村民高度的自觉和自律，那么村干部入户走访每小时登记的数据都会不一样，而且比较危险。
Without a high degree of self-awareness and self-discipline on the part of the villagers, the hourly rate of entry visits by village officials would be different and more dangerous.
一位重庆涪陵地区的村支书也告诉《棱镜》，此次防疫要依靠村民自发监督。
Chongqing Fuling a village branch of the book also told "prism," this vaccination depends on the villagers spontaneous supervision.
当地一位村支书的儿子从武汉返乡没有报告，还出去主持工作。
The son of a local village branch returned home from Wuhan without report, but also went out to host the work.
最后被村民举报，与其密切接触的20多人被隔离。
They were eventually reported by the villagers and more than 20 people in close contact with them were isolated.
“乡镇上都不允许外村人往来，本村的也都提前通知别回来了。
'Villagers are not allowed to travel in the townships, and everyone in our village has been told not to return.
这都是村民自发要求的。
This was all spontaneously demanded by the villagers.
”袁少敏告诉《棱镜》，袁湖村很早之前就由村民组建了理事会。
Yuan Shaomin told Prism that the villagers had formed the council long ago.
在此次防疫工作中，理事会成员义务担起宣传员和监督员的责任。
In this vaccination campaign, the members of the Council volunteered to assume the responsibilities of propagandists and supervisors.
“今天是封村第八天，成效慢慢显现，还希望大家保持安静。
"Today is the eighth day of the village, the results slowly show, but also hope that we remain quiet.
坚持，坚持，坚持就是胜利。
Persistence, persistence and persistence are victories.
”2月1日晚，袁少敏在朋友圈写道。
Yuan Shaomin wrote in a circle of friends on the night of February 1.
经本人同意，《棱镜》节选了袁少敏的部分防疫“日记”：1月22日：目前防疫情最有效的办法是：宣传，宣传，再宣传 ，不想听也要宣传；喝水，喝水，多喝水，不想喝也要喝水；口罩，口罩，带口罩，有麻烦也要带口罩；洗手，洗手，多洗手，饭前便后要洗手。

1月23日：袁湖村的亲人们：为了你和家人的身体健康，也为了你周边相邻和亲戚朋友的身体健康，近段时间凡是从武汉回来或途径武汉回来的亲人们，请第一时间到村卫生室找詹少林院长登记，随时检测体温，接受电话访问。
Yuan Hu's relatives: For the sake of your health and that of your family, and for the sake of the health of your neighbors, relatives and friends around you, relatives who have returned from Wuhan recently should come to the village health office to register with Dean Zhan Shaolin at any time to check their temperature and give telephone interviews.
……建议这个春节拜年要谨慎，能不出去不要出去，特别不要进城或到人口密集的地方，万不得已必须出门的请带好口罩，平时多洗手，多喝水。

身体健康和生命比面子更值钱。
Health and life are worth more than face.
我郑重声明，即使是你非要串门拜年，我一概不接待，家里更没有人回拜。
I solemnly declare that I will not receive you even if you insist on visiting during the New Year.
不相互串门就是最好的祝福，是对健康的尊重，是对老人最大的孝。
Do not cross the door is the best blessing, is the respect for health, is the oldest filial piety.
1月26日：匆匆忙忙一晃就是一天，抽查重点对象测体温，走访返乡人员重点管控，重点做宣传，分头搞入户登记走访，将偷偷进村外来人员劝离 ……下午风大，太冷了，冻死了。
January 26: a day in a hurry, spot-check the key subjects temperature, visit returnees key control, focus on publicity, separate household registration visits, will sneak into the village outside people to persuade...... afternoon windy, too cold, frozen to death.
这个时候，千万别感冒。
Never catch a cold at this time.
1月27日：再次强调，请大家不要随意外出，外出了就不要回袁湖村的家，老实呆在各湾各家各住处，这就是对自己对大家的尊重，你的规矩行为就是对战胜此次疫情最大的贡献。
27 January: Once again, please do not go out at will, do not go back to Yuan Lake Village home, honest stay in the various Bay homes, this is to their own respect for everyone, your behavior is the greatest contribution to the fight against the epidemic.
1月28日：我真心就服了你们，也信了你们的邪，城里这么危险，一天新增加这么多病例，躲都躲不赢，你为什么还要往城里冲进冲出，从城里冲出冲回啊！请你要顾及其他的人啊。
January 28: I believed in you, and I believed in you. It was so dangerous in the city, with so many new cases in one day that you couldn't hide, why did you rush in and out of town and rush back out of the city!
……再次奉劝大家！拜托大家！不要出村，不要再在城里和村里往返穿梭，好好待在家里，待在村里，还熬十天，情况一定有好转，相信我们的国家一定会战胜这场疫情。
Please don't go out of the village, don't go back and forth between the city and the village, stay at home and stay in the village for ten days. Things will certainly improve and we are sure that our country will overcome this epidemic.
1月29日：今天像打仗的搞了一天，累得半死……如果每个人都能自律自觉，遵守规则，就没有这么累了。
January 29: Today is like a day of war, tired to death... If everyone can self-discipline and abide by the rules, they will not be so tired.
1月30日：调动群众一起战斗，通过群众做、群众看才是深入人心的最好宣传。
January 30: Mobilize the masses to fight together, through the masses to do, the best publicity is deeply rooted in the public.
单元越小，风险就越小，外来人员进湾入户（包括村干部）越少，传播的途径就越少，放手让群众干吧！少来些越俎代庖。
The smaller the unit, the less risk there is. The fewer outsiders come into the bay (including village officials), the less there are ways to spread it.
1月31日：今天我们打开绿色通道，按前期预案，派人集中采购煤气，桶装水，保障生活必需品供应。
January 31: Today we open the green channel, according to the pre-plan, send people to focus on the procurement of gas, water barrel, to ensure the supply of necessities.

LPG stations are not open for business, water stores in Wanggang are out of stock and certain parts of the city are closed to traffic and have to be returned empty.
没有煤气的，做饭烧水改烧煤烧柴，没有柴火炉子的用砖码，实在没有地方的去田埂上挖灶埋锅做饭，你们小时候经常干的事（当然这句话是玩笑）。
There is no gas, cooking water to burn coal and firewood, no wood stove brick, there is no place to dig cooker on the ridge to cook, you often do as a child (of course, joke).
没有桶装水就放勤快点烧自来水喝，喝烧开的水还安全些。
Do not have a bucket of water on the point of running water to drink, drink boiling water is still safer.
不妨体验一次传统的农村生活。
Try to experience a traditional country life.
没有米的，明天来办公室购买，我已经联系好了香润的吴稻长，他们基地有米销售。
