记者：陈鹏 来源：界面商学院（ID：Jmbizlab）“ 植信投资首席经济学家、中国首席经济学家论坛理事长连平认为，近期欧美股市的持续暴跌已表现出非常强烈的危机征兆，发生全球金融危机的风险越来越大。
Journalist: Interface Business School (ID: Jmbizlab) Principal Economist and Chairman of China's Chief Economist Forum Lianping believes the recent sharp drops in US and European stock markets have shown very strong signs of crisis and the risk of a global financial crisis is growing.
他认为，国内房地产政策要“因时而变”，真正落实“因城施策”，不能机械地将房地产政策调整理解为走房地产刺激经济的老路。
He believes that domestic real estate policy to "change from time to time," the implementation of "due to the city policy," can not automatically understand the real estate policy adjustment as a real estate to stimulate the economy.
”随着新冠肺炎疫情海外扩散，全球金融市场大幅震荡，投资者对发生新一轮全球金融危机的担忧不断上升。
As the outbreak spread overseas and global financial markets shook sharply, investor fears of a new round of global financial crisis mounted.
美联储罕见地在半个月的时间里两次大举降息，在此背景下，有关中国宏观政策应如何发力的声音渐大渐杂。
Against the backdrop of the Fed's rare two big rate cuts in half a month, voices are growing about how China's macroeconomic policy should work.
植信投资首席经济学家、中国首席经济学家论坛理事长连平认为，近期欧美股市的持续暴跌已表现出非常强烈的危机征兆，发生全球金融危机的风险越来越大。
Lianping, chief economist and chief economist of the China Chief Economist Forum, said the recent sharp declines in European and US stock markets had shown very strong signs of crisis and the risk of a global financial crisis was growing.
连平指出，投资品无差别的暴跌，说明市场的恐慌已经到了相当的程度，以至于大家都要紧紧捂住自己的钱袋子。
Lianping pointed out that the indiscriminate collapse of investment goods, indicating that the market panic has reached such a degree that everyone has to tightly cover their own money bags.
这很可能发展成金融危机的一个先决条件——流动性在短时间内迅速枯竭，导致各种债务无法正常清偿，最终令整个市场进入一个无序的状态。
This is likely to develop into a precondition for a financial crisis, in which liquidity rapidly dries up in a short time, causing debts to go bad and ending up in a disorderly fashion.
“接下来需要进一步观察，是不是可能会出现一大批金融机构倒闭，甚至于系统重要性的金融机构的倒闭，这将是发生金融危机的非常明确的信号。
"The next thing to see is whether there could be a wave of financial institution failures, even of systemic importance, which would be a very clear signal of a financial crisis."
”他说。
'he said.
连平表示，随着国内新冠疫情形势逐步缓解，中国经济出现一个小“V”型反弹的可能性很大。
Lianping said that with the domestic situation of the new crown gradually alleviated, China's economy appears a small "V" rebound is very likely.
但由于现在海外疫情迅速扩散，全球经济放缓、部分国家陷入衰退可能无法避免，这会给中国恢复正常经济增长的过程带来一些阻碍，这就需要监管层根据实际情况有针对性地采取一些措施，并适当调整一些目标。
But now that the epidemic is spreading rapidly abroad and a global economic slowdown and recession in some countries may be inevitable, this could create some obstacles to China's return to normal economic growth, which would require targeted regulatory action and appropriate targeting.
他提到，房地产政策要“因时而变”，真正全面落实“因城施策”，不能机械地将房地产政策调整理解为走房地产刺激经济的老路。
He mentioned that real estate policy should "change from time to time" and fully implement the "policy of the city," and should not be interpreted mechanically as a real estate policy adjustment to stimulate the economy.
“现在说到（有些城市）房地产调控政策松动，可能一些上级政府也有担心，怕大家认为这样做是为了刺激经济，引起市场上许多不同的评论。
"Speaking now about the loosening of [some cities] housing regulation, there may also be concerns on the part of some higher levels of government that it is perceived as an attempt to stimulate the economy and has given rise to many different comments in the market.
有这种担心是正常的，但我觉得实事求是才是政策的灵魂。
It is normal to worry about this, but I think seeking truth from facts is the soul of policy.
”连平说。
"said Lianping.
以下是采访实录界面新闻：您如何看待本周美联储再次紧急降息和重启量化宽松的举措？连平：应该说大的方向在市场预期之中，但是来得这么快，稍微超出市场预期。
What do you think of this week's emergency Fed rate cut and the relaunch of quantitative easing (QE)? Lian Ping: It's fair to say that the broad direction is in line with market expectations, but it came so quickly, slightly beyond market expectations.
当前的市场反应已经说明了问题，市场并没有因此受到很大的提振和鼓舞，相反，出现了较为明显的波动。
The current market reaction has shown that the market has not been greatly boosted and encouraged, on the contrary, there have been more obvious fluctuations.
我认为这主要是因为市场对美联储进一步的政策空间抱有很大疑虑。
I think this is mainly because markets have big doubts about the Fed's further policy space.
理论上，这些措施会有一定积极作用。
In theory, such measures would have a positive effect.
一是稳定市场信心，二是为市场流动性的平稳注入新能量，这也是非常重要的。
One is to stabilize market confidence and the other is to inject new energy into market liquidity smoothly, which is also very important.
因为对于整个金融体系来说，保持流动性的平稳运行至关重要，否则一旦流动性枯竭或者阶段性过度紧缩，就会带来金融危机。
For the financial system as a whole, it is essential to keep liquidity running smoothly, without which a financial crisis would ensue if liquidity dried up or if periods of excessive tightening were phased in.
但问题是，从中期来看，如果疫情进一步发展，美国经济遭受更多负面效应，经济压力还会进一步增大。
But the problem is that in the medium term, if the epidemic develops further and the US economy suffers more negative effects, the economic pressure will increase further.
这种情况下，未来政策还能做什么？应该说，是有一定空间，但空间不大了。
In this case, what can future policy do? Should say, there is certain space, but the space is not big.
界面新闻：您认为今年发生全球金融危机的风险有多高？连平：风险是越来越大。
Interface News: How high do you think the risk of a global financial crisis this year? Lianping: The risks are getting bigger.
危机状况目前还没有完全表现出来，但是已经有了非常强烈的征兆，就像股市出现这样持续的暴跌。
The crisis is not yet fully under way, but there are already very strong signs, like the continuing plunge in the stock market.
从美国股市来看，很短的时间内出现多次熔断，过去从来没有出现过，甚至在2008年金融危机中，也没有像目前这样的波动。
In the US stock market, there have been several meltdowns in a very short period of time, never before, not even during the 2008 financial crisis.
美国股市过去长期走牛，在各种因素的持续推动下，不断创出新高，越来越脱离基本面。
The US stock market has long been bullish, driven by a variety of factors, constantly hit new highs, increasingly divorced from fundamentals.
因此，现在这种规模大、程度深的调整，会给各类机构投资者带来很大的负面影响。
Therefore, such a large-scale, deep-going adjustment, will bring great negative impact on a variety of institutional investors.
为了应对这种巨大的冲击，政策确实应该出手来维持市场的平稳。
To cope with such a shock, policies should indeed be aimed at keeping markets stable.
但很可惜的是，发达国家，尤其是美国、欧洲一些主要国家的政策空间已经十分有限，没有更多的强有力的政策可以来应对。
Unfortunately, however, policy space in developed countries, particularly in the United States and some major European countries, is already limited and there are no more robust policies to address.
量化宽松已经推行了很多年，降息的话，现在利率还能降到哪去？很多国家都已经是负利率、零利率。
QE has been going on for years, and if interest rates were cut, where would they go now? Many countries already have negative rates and zero rates.
在这种情况下，大家对市场的波动就会感到更大的恐慌，更觉得未来前途难卜。
In this case, people will feel more panic about the volatility of the market, but also feel the future uncertain.
未来市场到底会运行到一个什么状况？大家觉得这个风险非常大。
What will happen to the market in the future? The risk is felt to be enormous.
所以我们看到，本来被认为是避险的资产，比如黄金，也出现了暴跌。
So we see a sharp drop in what was supposed to be a safe haven, such as gold.
这种无差别的暴跌，就说明市场的恐慌已经到了相当的程度，以至于大家都紧紧捂住自己的钱袋子。
This undifferentiated slump shows that the market panic has reached such an extent that everyone is clutching their purse strings.
这就很可能发展成金融危机的一个先决条件——流动性在很短的时间内迅速枯竭，进而使得各种债务无法正常清偿，最终导致整个市场进入一个无序的状态。
This is likely to develop into a precondition for a financial crisis in which liquidity is quickly dried up in a short period of time, leaving debts that cannot be liquidated properly and ultimately leading to a disorderly market.
接下来我们还需要进一步观察，看看是不是可能会出现一大批金融机构倒闭，甚至于系统重要性的金融机构的倒闭，这是发生金融危机的非常明确的信号。
Next, we need to look further to see whether there is a very clear signal of the financial crisis that a large number of financial institutions may fail, even systemically important ones.
另外，虽然现在对全球经济整体是否会陷入衰退还很难得出结论，但是，这种金融市场波动，尤其是疫情和油价下跌对全球经济的打击，接下来会非常明显地表现出来。
Moreover, while it is far from certain that the global economy as a whole will be in a recession, the impact of such financial market volatility, particularly the epidemic and falling oil prices, on the global economy is now very much in evidence.
一些国家，尤其是受疫情影响比较大的国家未来陷入衰退的可能性比较大，也就是经济负增长。
Some countries, especially those more affected by the epidemic, are more likely to fall into recession in the future, namely, negative economic growth.
欧洲的一些经济体接下来出现负增长的概率比较高，美国也很难排除在未来几个季度进入负增长的可能性。
Some European economies are more likely to experience negative growth next, and it is difficult for the US to rule out negative growth in the coming quarters.
这也使得全球经济衰退的阴影越来越大。
It also casts a growing shadow over the global recession.
当然了，因为发展中国家中间还有一些重要的经济体，比如中国、印度，可能还能维持一个不低的增速，即偏高一点的正增长，会对全球经济有所贡献。
Of course, because there are also important economies among developing countries, such as China and India, that are likely to maintain a significant rate of growth, that is, higher positive growth, which will contribute to the global economy.
界面新闻：3月以来，美国已经累计降息1.5个百分点，这会不会倒逼中国央行加大降息幅度？连平：在降息的问题上，不存在倒逼的压力。
Interface News: The US has cut interest rates by 1.5 percentage points since March. Will that force the People's Bank of China to cut interest rates more? Lianping: There is no pressure to reverse that.
它和加息不一样。
It's not like raising interest rates.
如果是加息，美国利率水平抬高之后，或者超出我国的利率水平，可能会引起资本尤其是短期资本外流，流向美元资产。
If interest rates are raised, the level of interest rates in the United States rises, or if they exceed the level of interest rates in our country, they may trigger capital outflows, especially short-term capital, to dollar assets.
但现在是倒过来的，美国利率水平很低，我们要高一些，因此从利差角度来说，美元资产不见得会吸引资金进入，从这一点来说没有倒逼作用。
But now it's the other way around, because US interest rates are low and we want to be higher, so dollar assets don't necessarily attract money from a spread point of view, which has no upside down.
不过，这确实是给了我们货币政策进一步向宽松方向调整的空间。
However, this does give us room for further monetary policy adjustments in the direction of easing.
接下来，我们要不要降息，关键是要看中国经济自身的需要以及政策的考量。
Next, whether we cut interest rates depends on the needs of the Chinese economy itself and policy considerations.
现在来看，总的政策方向是明确的，就是加大逆周期调节力度，货币政策应更加注重灵活适度，另一方面，在宏观杠杆率、企业部门债务水平仍比较高的情况下，不能搞“大水漫灌”，不宜大规模投放信贷。
The general policy direction is now clear: more countercyclical adjustment, more flexible monetary policies, and, at the same time, no more "flood irrigation" and no large-scale credit investment in the face of relatively high levels of macro-leverage and corporate sector debt.
但是，信贷和社融增速比前些年适当高一些，我觉得还是应该的。
But credit and social finance are growing at a slightly higher rate than in previous years, and I think we should.
货币政策现在总体是三重组合，即总量、结构和价格，未来在这三个方面还会有进一步的作为。
Monetary policy as a whole is now a triple combination of volume, structure and prices, on which further work will be done in the future.
所谓总量，就是流动性保持合理充裕，目前货币市场利率水平较低，流动性宽裕，没有什么大问题；第二，结构性政策已经在推行了，比如再贷款；第三，价格型政策其实也在推进，接下来可能会推进得更加频繁一些，就是说未来LPR（贷款市场报价利率）下调幅度会比去年明显加大，LPR、资产端的降息很有可能就在3月。
Second, structural policies are already in place, such as refinancing; thirdly, price-oriented policies are already being pursued, possibly more frequently, that is, future LPR (loan market quote rates) will be significantly higher than last year, and LPR and asset-side interest rate cuts are likely to be as early as March.
负债端的降息可能也会象征性地推进一些。
The interest rate cut on the indebted side may also be a symbolic boost.
尽管我个人不是很赞成调整存款基准利率，但如果未来CPI出现下行趋势，存款基准利率适当小幅度下调，这种可能性是不能排除的。
Although I am not personally in favor of a change in the benchmark deposit rate, this possibility cannot be ruled out if there is a downward trend in CPI and a modest downward revision of the benchmark deposit rate in the future.
当然，考虑到CPI阶段性偏高的情况，大幅度降息恐怕没有空间。
Of course, given the CPI phase high situation, I am afraid there is no room for a substantial rate cut.
界面新闻：您对于今年国内的经济运行如何预判？连平：国内疫情的影响其实正在逐步展现，1-2月份特别明显，3月以来，情况正在逐步改善。
Interface News: How do you predict the domestic economy this yearLianping: The impact of the epidemic is actually unfolding, particularly in January-February, and the situation has been gradually improving since March.
如果仅看国内疫情的影响，应该说在两季度以后出现一个小“V”型反弹的可能性比较大。
If only look at the impact of the domestic epidemic, it should be said that after the two quarters of a small "V" rebound is more likely.
但现在的问题是，在V型反弹的过程中，可能还会受到世界经济明显放缓、一部分国家衰退造成的冲击，给我们未来的反弹、恢复正常经济增长的过程带来一些阻碍，所以未来还需要根据实际经济运行情况，有针对性地采取一系列政策，同时也要适当调整我们有关的一些目标。
But the problem now is that the V-shaped rebound is likely to be accompanied by a marked slowdown in the world economy and a partial recession in some countries, which will create some obstacles to our future rebound and the process of restoring normal economic growth. Therefore, we need to adopt a series of targeted policies according to the actual economic performance, while also appropriately adjusting some of our relevant targets.
比如，在实现基本目标如脱贫、经济增长总目标的情况下，有些相关的政策目标，是不是可以做一些适当的调整或者有一些弹性？界面新闻：您对今年GDP增速有何预期？连平：我觉得不确定性比较大，所以政府对于2020年的经济增长目标是不是也可以给出一个区间？比如说5.5%-5.8%，可能相对更接近实际经济运行的变化，而且通过加大逆周期政策力度，是有可能实现的。
For example, in the context of achieving basic goals such as poverty alleviation and overall economic growth, are there some relevant policy objectives that can be appropriately adjusted or flexible? Interface News: What do you expect for GDP growth this yearLian Ping: I feel more uncertain, so is the government likely to give a range of 5.5% -5.8% for 2020.
当然，我们还要考虑实现这个目标跟保持就业平稳增长之间的关系。
Of course, we also need to consider the relationship between achieving this goal and maintaining steady employment growth.
如果就业能平稳增长，那这个增速目标应该说是我们能够接受的。
If employment can grow steadily, then this growth target should be acceptable to us.
因为经济增长背后最终还是就业。
Because behind the economic growth is finally employment.
界面新闻：对于刺激消费需求，您有何想法？不少人呼吁给低收入群体发消费券，您怎么看？连平：对于消费需求的提振，在复产过程中，需要平衡好防治疫情和推动消费者之间的平衡。
Interface News: What do you think about stimulating consumer demand? Many people are calling for the issue of vouchers to low-income groups. What do you think? Lianping: To boost consumer demand, we need to strike a balance between fighting the epidemic and promoting the balance between consumers.
对于人口比较聚集的地方，比如餐饮，需要在做好疫情防控的同时，有针对性地采取一些措施释放需求。
For places where the population is concentrated, such as catering, it is necessary to do a good job of disease prevention and control, while taking some targeted measures to release demand.
至于消费券，中国人口众多，人口差异也比较大，这样的做法需要考虑不同层次怎么发放？发多大规模？效果是不是好？都需要考量。
As for the consumption vouchers, China has a large population and a large population difference. How should such a practice be considered at different levels? How large is it? Is the effect good? Both need to be considered.
如果是“一刀切”，那刺激效应可能很有限。
If it is "one size fits all," the stimulus may be limited.
而且对于低收入阶层，消费券是不是一定会增加消费？这是一个问题。
And for lower-income people, is the consumption voucher bound to increase consumption? That's a question.
类似2008年“家电下乡”的措施是比较有效的，因为针对性比较强。
Similar to the 2008 "home appliances down to the countryside" measures are more effective, because the targeted is stronger.
但在农村生活消费已经上了一个档次之后，再要这样做的空间相对比较小。
However, after the consumption of rural life has been a level, there is relatively little room to do so.
从家电领域来说，该有的都有了，从汽车角度来看，中国汽车的保有量也已经很高了。
In the field of home appliances, there should be, from the perspective of cars, Chinese car ownership is already very high.
界面新闻：您怎么看待现在一些提议大规模基建、新基建，以及松绑房地产调控政策的声音?连平：目前情况下，政策进一步做些调整是应该的，但是在更加积极的同时，也要把握好度。
Interface News: What do you think of some of the current proposals for large-scale infrastructure projects, new infrastructure projects and the relaxation of real estate regulation? Lianping: under the present circumstances, further policy adjustments are desirable, but at the same time, you should grasp the benefits.
我们不赞成经济政策可以没有任何底线地“大水漫灌”或者过度采取一些措施，这样会带来后遗症，会对之后的经济造成许多新问题。
We do not agree that economic policy can be "flooded" without any bottom line or that excessive measures should be taken, which would have sequelae and create many new problems for the economy.
毫无疑问，基建作为投资的重要领域，应该是未来政策作用的重要方面。
There is no doubt that infrastructure, as an important area of investment, should be an important aspect of future policy roles.
因为在世界经济面临衰退压力的情况下，出口很难有大幅提升，甚至在原有水平上保持稳固；就消费来说，短期又很难有非常强有力的举措能够稳住经济。
With the world economy under recessionary pressure, exports are unlikely to rise significantly, or even remain stable at their previous levels; and, in the case of consumption, there are few very strong short-term measures to stabilize the economy.
同时，基建本身确实有需求，新型城镇化、区域经济一体化，以及许多新的经济领域都需要有一系列基础设施建设，我们的财政也有能力。
At the same time, there is a real need for infrastructure, new forms of urbanization, regional economic integration and a host of new areas of the economy that require a range of infrastructure, as well as our financial capacity.
既然是这样，推出政策带动基础设施建设，包括传统基建和“新基建”，我觉得应该是恰逢其时，但是也要把握好度。
Given this, I think it is time to introduce policies to drive infrastructure, including traditional infrastructure and "new infrastructure," but also to take advantage of it.
在房地产方面，我觉得目前主要问题在于相关政策如何“因时而变”，不要搞“一刀切”，真正全面落实“因城施策”。
As for real estate, I think the main issue is how to change the relevant policies from time to time, so as not to apply one-size-fits-all policy to fully implement the Incheng policy.
所谓“因时而变”，前些年由于全国房价上涨压力较大，绝大部分地方推出了许多限制需求的政策，现在情况已经发生了很大变化，很多地方由原来有大量需求转变为需求不足，房价有下行压力。
In the past few years, as a result of the pressure of rising house prices across the country and the introduction of many demand-limiting policies in most places, the situation has changed greatly. In many places there has been a shift from heavy demand to insufficient demand and downward pressure on house prices.
这种需求的变化需要政策也相应变化，而不能机械地理解为又把房地产作为刺激经济增长的手段。
This change in demand requires a corresponding change in policy, which cannot be understood mechanically as a means of stimulating economic growth.
在需求不足的情况下，很多城市还在那里搞所谓“四限”，本身就没有必要。
In a situation of insufficient demand, many cities still practice the so-called "four limits" there, which is not necessary in itself.
问题是，在目前的体制机制之下，很多地方明明有必要做一些调整，但是又非常谨慎，不去调整，左顾右盼，担心被扣上“用房地产刺激经济发展”的帽子。
The problem is that, under the current institutional mechanism, some adjustments are clearly necessary in many places, but with great care not to adjust and look left and right for fear of being labelled as "real estate to stimulate the economy."
我觉得在这方面还是要从实际出发，不同城市根据自身实际情况进行调整。
I think in this regard or from the practical point of view, different cities according to their actual situation to adjust.
现在看，国务院提出的房地产政策“因城施策”，并没有全面落实。
Now, the real estate policy put forward by the State Council has not been fully implemented.
界面新闻：最近一个比较有意思的现象是，个别地方提出了下调房贷首付比，但前脚刚发文，后脚又马上撤销。
Interface News: A more interesting recent phenomenon is that a few places have proposed a reduction in the down payment ratio, but the front foot has just issued a letter, the hind legs were immediately withdrawn.
这是否就是您前面提到的情况？连平：这个就是“一刀切”。
Is this the situation you mentioned earlier? Lianping: This is one size fits all.
在这个方面，我觉得相关政策需要更高层加以澄清。
In this regard, I feel that the relevant policy needs to be clarified at a higher level.
现在说到（有些城市）房地产调控政策松动，可能一些上级政府也有担心，怕大家认为这样做是为了刺激经济，引起市场上许多不同的评论。
Now, speaking of the loosening of property regulations, there may also be concerns among some higher-level governments that it is seen as an attempt to stimulate the economy, prompting many different comments in the market.
有这种担心是正常的，但我觉得实事求是才是政策的灵魂。
It is normal to worry about this, but I think seeking truth from facts is the soul of policy.
为了保障“因城施策”真正全面落实，需要有一个合理适当的评估机制，上级管理部门应该派出专业的机构进行评估。
In order to ensure the full implementation of the "Incheng policy," a reasonable and appropriate evaluation mechanism is needed.
比如，有城市提出房地产政策要发生什么变化，可以上报评估，而不是说上报以后就被“一刀切”。
For example, some cities have proposed changes to real estate policies that can be reported for assessment, rather than being reported as "one size fits all."
我们也相信，必定是有些城市的需求状况已经发生了明显变化，政策需要调整。
We also believe that it must be that the demand situation in some cities has changed significantly and that policies need to be adjusted.
