一场疫情，把不少企业的节奏打乱，旅游业首当其冲。
An epidemic has disrupted the pace of many enterprises, with tourism bearing the brunt of the epidemic.
两三天从高峰跌到低谷，不少企业主称无法作出反应。
Two or three days went from peak to trough, and many business owners said they could not respond.
有民宿老板为春节多买一个冰柜，购置大量鸡鸭、鲜奶；有企业从早到晚开会，讨论春节高峰的应对……这些忙碌的横切面都矗立在1月24日之前。
Some homeowners buy an extra refrigerator for the Spring Festival and buy lots of chickens, ducks and milk. Some companies hold meetings from morning to night to discuss the response to the Spring Festival rush.
之后，酒店、航班迎来大面积退单，有企业为此专门调度20多个员工专职退票，全部退完则需要一周。
Afterward, the hotel, the flight ushered in the large area return bill, has the enterprise specially dispatches 20 full-time refunds for this purpose, all returns needs one week.
以下是4个创业者的故事。
Here are the stories of four entrepreneurs.
他们身处旅游业链条的不同环节，各自讲述了疫情所带来的冲击和改变。
They are in different links of the tourism chain, telling their stories about the impact and changes brought about by the epidemic.
最后，他们都说到了希望，想着疫情早点结束，旅游业可能在“休克防御”后迎来一个井喷期。
Finally, they spoke of hope that, given the early end of the epidemic, the tourism industry might see a blowout period after "shock prevention."
文|龚菁琦编辑 |楚明运营 |肖睿“自掏100万给员工发工资”民宿创业者谢强我们在广东有3家民宿，20间房，原本1月15号左右都预定完了，从腊月二十八到年初六几乎都是满房。
Running & # 44; Gong & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; &
1月20日钟南山院士宣布人传人后，我有点忧心，很多顾客也忧虑，打电话过来问。
January 20 Academician Zhong Nan Shan announced that after the person-to-person, I was a bit worried, many customers also worried, called to ask.
开始大部分都说愿意改期，迟点再来，当然我们也无条件退改。
At first most of them said they would like to reschedule and come back later. Of course we quit unconditionally.
等到后面疫情越来越严重，特别是1月23日武汉要封城后，第二天是大年三十，变成大面积退款，所有人都在忙着协商、对接。
After the epidemic became more and more serious, especially on January 23, Wuhan to close the city, the next day is the New Year's Eve, into a large refund, everyone is busy negotiating, docking.
往年，春节客人特别多，厨房从早上6点开始备早餐，晚上可能还有烧烤、party，一个店10个人忙得团团转。
In previous years, Spring Festival guests are particularly numerous, the kitchen from 6 a.m. to prepare breakfast, evening may also have barbecue, party, a shop 10 people busy around.
这个年很特别，即使没有客人，我们反而更忙了。
It was a special year, and we were even busier without company.
两三天的形势变得太快，要马上作出反应，真来不及。
Two or three days went by so quickly that it was too late to react.
1月21号我们准备好所有的物料，冰柜不够，还新添了一台。
We have everything ready on January 21st. We don't have enough fridges and we've got a new one.
当地有个花灯节打算1月22号开，结果只开了2个小时就关掉，花也没卖，最后看到摊贩把一摞摞叠起的花砸烂，让人心疼。
There was a Lantern Festival planned for January 22, only to open two hours after the switch off, flowers were not sold, and finally saw stacks of stacks of flowers smashed, let people feel distressed.
▲鲜花卖不出去，又不易储存，摊贩只得把花砸烂。
Flowers can not be sold, and not easy to store, vendors have to smash flowers.
图/ 受访者提供1月20号还是满房，1月23号开始就基本上没客人。
Chart / Respondents reported full occupancy on January 20th and almost no guests from January 23rd onwards.
省内强制性要求停业，不能私自接待湖北籍客人，只能由政府指定地点接待。
It can not receive Hubei guests without permission. It can only be received at a place designated by the government.
有一个深圳的客人早入住，带着父母来的，是湖北籍，但一直住在深圳。
One of the guests from Shenzhen moved in early. He came with his parents. He is from Hubei, but he lives in Shenzhen all the time.
卫生院过来检测，确定没问题，才让他继续住。
The clinic came by to check to make sure there was nothing wrong with him.
谁知道年初一政府公告，只要是湖北籍的客户入住，都不允许再离开，就地隔离14天。
Who knows the New Year's Day announcement, as long as the Hubei nationality of customers are not allowed to leave, on-site isolation for 14 days.
中午12点来的通告，那客人下午2点刚好退房走。
The announcement came at twelve o'clock, and the guest checked out at 2 p.m.
现在损失蛮大，可能会有两三百万元。
Losses are quite high now, maybe two or three million dollars.
我们原本就靠春节、暑假还有国庆创收，现在相当于整个春节收入是零。
We used to rely on the Spring Festival, summer holidays and the National Day income generation, now equivalent to the entire Spring Festival revenue is zero.
前期大量的存货也废了，例如购入的100件鲜牛奶，只有10天有效期，如今只能要求员工年夜饭的时候用牛奶干杯。
Much of the stock from earlier periods, such as 100 pieces of fresh milk bought with a 10-day validity period, is now available for staff to drink milk during the Lunar New Year's Eve meal.
300只鸡鸭，就全当员工餐了。
300 chickens and ducks, it's all staff food.
工资更是头疼的一部分。
Wages are part of the headache.
每个月的10号会发工资，我和员工讲，1月份的工资会发到位，2月份可能按广东当地最低工资标准发放生活费，这也是广东省人社厅发布的一个指导意见，算下来是1500-2100元的样子。
The salary will be paid on the 10th every month. I told the employees that the salary will be paid in January and the living expenses may be paid according to the local minimum wage in February.
但以往春节算上加班，3倍工资，清洁岗阿姨都有5000多元。
But in the past Spring Festival count overtime, three times the salary, cleaning aunt Gang have more than 5000.
2月1号我开始打算实行上半个月休半个月的模式，一个门店原本10个人，只留5个人来轮岗，最低成本去维持，想着一旦能够恢复，还能马上到正常营业状态。
On February 1, I began to plan to take a half-month break from the previous half-month model, with 10 people in one shop leaving only five people on rotation at minimal cost, hoping to get back to normal business as soon as possible.
现在马上裁员也不行，重新培养人成本挺大。
It's not right now to lay off workers. It's costly to retrain people.
如果短期内三个月的话，还是能够撑得住，但如果持续半年甚至一年，确实挺糟糕。
If three months in the short term, it will hold, but if it lasts half a year or even a year, it's really bad.
我的上限是，自己账上掏100万发工资，大概能维持三四个月。
My upper limit is that I can pay a million bucks on my account for about three or four months.
年二十九、三十和初一是退单最高峰。
The twenty-ninth, thirtieth and first day of the year are the highest.
春晚，我哪有心思看，一堆祝福短信过来，新年快乐，一点都不快乐，我一概没回，真没心思，只想还要退多少？大年三十晚上一直都在沟通协调，有些客人要求马上退到账上，但款都在渠道商那儿，放假又转不出来，还有人称要投诉，打市长热线，315等等。
Chunwan, I have no mood to see, a bunch of blessing over the text messages, happy New Year, I am not happy, I have no thought, I really do not think how much to return?
也真的会有相关部门打电话来，态度从一开始的强势，说你一定要退，给一个方案，慢慢变得理解我们，实在是退款的太多，后面说尽量沟通，协商好。
There will really be a call from the relevant departments, attitude from the beginning of the strong, said you must return, to a program, slowly become to understand us, is really too much refund, said as much as possible to communicate, negotiate well.
一个晚上我都把自己关在房间打电话，没有告诉妻儿什么麻烦，孩子还小，不想让他们难受。
One night I shut myself up in my room and phoned my wife and children, who were too young to suffer.
处理完已经是凌晨1点，然后看了一场电影，《囧妈》，熬到3点让自己累了，睡觉。
It was 1: 00 in the morning, and then I watched a movie, "Damn Me," until 3: 00 to make myself tired and go to sleep.
也不是第一次创业，即便这种情况很少遇到，但也不至于一下子就把我们击倒，就像股市一样，不可能一直跌到崩盘，后面还是会涨起来。
Nor is it a first-time venture, and even if it rarely happens, it does not knock us down overnight. Like the stock market, it is unlikely to fall all the way to the crash and rise again.
这两天也有一些老客户说，实在受不了，在家里就要憋出病来，我和他开玩笑，你确定要来吗？你来要体检，要报备，我还可能要担处罚。
I'm joking with him. Are you sure you're coming? You're coming for a medical check-up, and I might have to pay for it.
他说没关系，我又说厨师都已经回家，他说，能煮碗面就很好。
'That's all right, 'I added.' The cooks have gone home, 'he said.' I can cook noodles very well.
大家被憋坏后，说不定有报复性的消费。
If everyone is pent up, there may be retaliatory spending.
我调侃他，你来了菜园子的菜倒是不用抢了，摘一箱，抱走。
I made fun of him, you came to the vegetable garden vegetables do not need to rob, pick a box, take away.
▲谢强民宿曾经的热闹场景。
Hsieh Qiang residential once lively scene.
图/ 受访者提供“上万家客栈集体停业”丽江客栈老板萱萱在丽江涑河古镇开客栈4年，过年是生意最好的时候，一共12间房，属于你有钱，我没房。
Zhang Xuan, owner of Lijiang Inn, opened an inn in Lijiang water-Su town for 4 years. The Spring Festival was the best time for business.
而在22号那天我们退了差不多20间房次，但另一面湖北客人没有地方住，有人在肯德基坐一晚。
On the 22nd, we returned almost 20 rooms, but on the other side of the street there was no room for guests. Someone sat in KFC overnight.
当时合伙人问我，如果有滞留在丽江的湖北客人，我们接不接？我说接，我是宜昌人，合伙人是武汉人。
At that time, the partners asked me, if there are stranded in Lijiang Hubei guests, we can not answer? I said, I Yichang people, the partners are Wuhan.
信息公布到平台后，大年三十、初一到初二接到八九百个电话。
Information published on the platform, about 30, the first day of the first two days to receive 8900 phone calls.
有在日本的，马来西亚的，在新加坡的，他们要回来，可是进不了武汉。
In Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, they want to come back, but they can't get into Wuhan.
丽江是1月25日也就是大年初一下的命令，封城，相当于所有客栈全部关，不接客，我们只能把后期的订单全部退完。
Lijiang is January 25, that is, the New Year's Day orders, the closure of the city, equivalent to all the inn, do not accept visitors, we can only return the late order.
无法接待湖北人，我们就组织一个群，和政府一起协商，定下安置酒店。
Unable to receive Hubei people, we organized a group, and the government together to negotiate, to settle the hotel.
操劳一圈，账算起来怎么都是亏的。
A lap of toil makes the account count as a loss.
这两个月，至少亏10万左右，人工3000元、水电3000元、房租一年25万等等，往年这个时期能够进账40万，还是非常有利润的。
In these two months, at least 100,000 loss, labor 3000 yuan, water and electricity 3000 yuan, rent a year 250,000, etc., in this period of the past year can be 400,000, or very profitable.
在丽江有1万多家客栈，总体算起来是一笔大数，若按每家亏10万，粗算是10亿。
There are more than 10,000 inns in Lijiang, which is a large sum overall. If you lose 100,000 per household, it is a billion.
安置酒店看上去有接待客人，但也是亏。
The hotel seemed to receive guests, but at a loss.
他们本来最便宜的房都是900块，被政府和我们每天磨，从900块磨到700块，从700块到400块，昨天晚上又磨下来100块。
The cheapest they could find were 900, grinded daily by the government and us, from 900 to 700, from 700 to 400, and polished off another 100 last night.
他们也不容易。
They weren't easy either.
可能是接触到客人、酒店和政府三种角色的难处，我对自己亏损的事倒看得更淡一点。
Perhaps it was the difficulty of reaching out to the three roles of guest, hotel and government, and I took the loss a little further.
那天在安置酒店看到留守的一线干部，天天跟人密切接触，只有一个单层的口罩。
That day in the placement of the hotel to see the left-behind cadres, daily close contact with people, only a single-storey mask.
而他们工作安排很好，湖北老乡每天水果都吃不完，各种慰问。
But their work arrangement is very good, Hubei Laoxiang every day fruit are unable to eat, various sympathy.
今年过年我没回家，老爸昨天还在问，今年没赚上钱，买物资的钱够不够？他很担心我。
I did not come home this New Year, my father yesterday still asked, this year did not earn enough money to buy supplies? He was worried about me.
现在丽江街上几乎没人，隔壁家回老家了，留下4条狗，我家也有一条狗，每天就喂狗，睡觉。
Lijiang Street is now almost empty, the next home home, leaving four dogs, my family also have a dog, every day feed the dog, sleep.
有时组织客栈的老板们包饺子，做卤鸡爪。
Sometimes the innkeeper is organized to make dumplings and make halogen chicken paws.
昨天我们给一个安置点送去卤鸡爪，今天帮助送口罩、鲜花饼。
Yesterday we sent halogen chicken paws to a settlement. Today we helped deliver masks and flowers.
往年这个时候从早忙到晚，送机、安排入住，当向导，晕晕乎乎的，现在做这些事，心反而很静。
This time of the year from early to late, to deliver planes, arrange to stay, as a guide, dizzy, now do these things, the heart is very quiet.
平常一年赚30万没问题，谁也不想钱在里面亏掉，今年大环境不好，淡然心态，莫去强求。
Usually a year to earn 300,000 no problem, no one wants to lose money in the inside, this year is not a good environment, indifferent mentality, do not force.
我准备好今年一年不挣钱，只要能保本就可以。
I'm ready to make no money this year as long as I can keep my money.
▲丽江古城景区暂停接待游客。
No visitors to the Old Town of Lijiang.
图/ 网络“很多同行到了生死关键”旅行平台CEO边帆1月中旬就有医生朋友告诉我武汉情况不太好，没想到和广东有关系。
2007-9-24 16: 19 [hide] "Many travel agents are critical to life and death." CEO Bian Fan had a doctor tell me in mid-January that Wuhan was not doing very well and had little to do with Guangdong.
从没什么信息，到信息突然爆发，以很猛烈的方式应对疫情，只有短短几天。
From the lack of information, to the sudden explosion of information, in a very violent way to deal with the epidemic, only a few days.
疫情最容易波及的是旅游业。
The epidemic is most likely to affect tourism.
以往的春节是旺季，一直会持续到正月十五，相对于平时来说都会涨价10%~20%，我们的房间平时是800多一间，可能涨个100来块钱。
Spring Festival used to be busy, will continue until the fifteenth day of the first month, relative to the usual increase of 10% ~ 20%, our room is usually more than 800, may rise 100 yuan.
但在大年三十那天，几乎全部都取消。
But on New Year's Eve, almost all of them were cancelled.
一个省内，政策各有松紧，像广东清远，要求景区、酒店关闭经营；惠州有一些民宿还是营业，因为旅游是惠州的一个支柱产业，上面只是说建议关停。
In one province, policies were relaxed, such as Qingyuan in Guangdong Province, requiring the closure of scenic areas and hotels; some residential accommodation in Huizhou was open because tourism was a pillar industry in Huizhou.
其实现实里也不得不关，有人把车进村的路堵上了，客人进不来，营业不了，索性就停掉。
In fact, the reality also had to close, someone into the village blocked the road, guests can not enter, can not open, simply stop.
民宿、酒店老板也不想去冒险，造成跟当地政府和居民关系紧张，可能没法维持以后的生意。
Residents and hoteliers do not want to take risks, creating tensions with local governments and residents that may not be able to sustain future business.
同行们都没有除夕。
None of the peers had New Year's Eve.
有一个团正好是大年初一去九寨沟，景区通知年三十晚上11点关闭，只能全部退款，游客没有损失，但旅行社每个人几百元的利润全泡汤。
One group just went to Jiuzhaigou on the first day of the new year. The scenic spot was closed at 11: 00 pm.
这还只是一个九寨沟，全国大部分景点都在那几天相继关闭。
It was only a Jiuzhaigou, and most of the country's scenic spots were closed in those days.
看到同行谈的感受是，想哭，真的想哭。
See peer talk feeling is, want to cry, really want to cry.
更多同行忙着和国外旅行社争取退款。
More colleagues are busy trying to get refunds from foreign travel agencies.
有同行做了40多人的迪拜团，疫情下中国游客无法入境。
A group of more than 40 people from the same community in Dubai has prevented Chinese tourists from entering the country during the outbreak.
迪拜旅行社给出两个方案，一是给出损失明细，和客人商量，接受就退剩下的钱；另外就是等疫情结束后，一年之内，客人走同样的行程不加价，也可以转让。
Dubai Travel Agency offers two options, one is to give a breakdown of the loss, discuss with the customer, accept the rest of the money; the other is to wait for the end of the epidemic, within a year, guests can take the same itinerary without a premium, or transfer it.
这给我处理当下平台退订有不少启发。
This gives me a lot of inspiration to deal with the withdrawal of the platform.
说起来，能处理好退单，是考验酒店、民宿、旅行社的生死关键。
Say, can handle the return bill well, is to test the hotel, residential, travel agency's life and death key.
一开始没那么严重时，我们公司尽量劝客人不要退。
When it was not so serious at first, our company tried to persuade the guests not to return it.
大面积要求退后，我们最好的解决方案就是免费改期，客人大部分都来自广东省，熟客很多，还有机会消耗这些资源。
The best solution for us is to change the dates for free. Most of the guests are from Guangdong Province, and there are many customers and opportunities to consume these resources.
休克式的防御，对整个旅游业影响很大。
Shock-style defense has a great impact on the tourism industry as a whole.
旅游是个非常综合的产业，吃、住、行、游、购、娱都算，牵涉了很长的链条。
Tourism is a very comprehensive industry, eat, live, travel, travel, purchase, entertainment, involving a long chain.
去年十一之后入住率就不太理想，本来春节卯足劲要赚钱。
After last year's 11 occupancy rate is not ideal, Spring Festival was full of energy to make money.
全部切断，处理不好，真怕很多人丢掉工作。
It's all cut off. I'm afraid a lot of people will lose their jobs.
但我看好今年五一，如果疫情能早点结束，提高内需的一个核心引擎还是旅游。
But I am optimistic that this May Day, if the epidemic can end sooner, a core engine to boost domestic demand or travel.

图/ 网络“这么大的窟窿，现金流很重要”北京包机平台公司CEO 邱华企业的现金流多重要，在这次疫情里体现得淋漓尽致，特别是我们这一行。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 116] / n. The cash flow of Qiu Hua, CEO of a Beijing-based charter platform, is very important, especially in our industry.
我们公司主业是做机票采购。
Our company is mainly engaged in air ticket purchasing.
做这个业务，首先要有国际航协的资质，预定还得有第三方担保。
To do this business, the first to have the International Air Transport Association qualifications, a third party is also scheduled to guarantee.
出票后，按一周两次支付钱给航协。
After the ticket is issued, pay to IATA twice a week.
包机是一个非常重资产的活儿。
Charter work is a very heavy asset.
比如包机去欧洲，一次就得投入一两百万，而我们业务量很大，几千万、上亿进去都是很正常的。
For example, charter flights to Europe, one or two million at a time, and our business volume, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars is very normal.
我算了一下这一次，担保押金近1个亿，加上支付给航空公司的钱，出去有近2亿元。
I calculated that this time the guarantee deposit was nearly $100 million, plus the money paid to the airline, leaving nearly $200 million.
出现疫情后，文旅部门宣布停止业务，1月24号发文从27号开始不接受新的团，27号以前的团可以正常的出行，从27号一直到3月底，可能都要取消，等于一整个季度的收益都受影响。
In the wake of the outbreak, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced that it would suspend operations. The new package would not be accepted from January 24th, and the previous batch would be able to travel normally from the 27th to the end of March.
钱退给客户，又没有新业务进来，每月要支出员工工资1000万，加上房租、税收一起大概1500万，一个季度亏在4500万元左右。
The money goes back to the customer and no new business comes in, and the monthly payroll costs of $10 million plus rent and taxes add up to about $15 million, leaving a quarterly deficit of about $45 million.
面对如此大的窟窿，现金流显得非常重要。
In the face of such a large hole, cash flow is very important.
我们去年资金储备还算比较充足，账上大概有1亿元左右。
Our capital reserve last year was fairly adequate, accounting for about 100 million yuan.
创业至今股东没有分过红，此外，年前正好收回一笔佣金，将近1亿元，大概算算，能撑半年。
Start-up so far shareholders have not been too red, in addition, just a year ago to recover a commission, nearly 100 million yuan, presumably, can last half a year.
过年这几天公司也没闲着，平时按正常的退票比例做人员安排，大概10多人负责就行。
In the past few days the company is not idle, usually in accordance with the normal proportion of refunds to do personnel arrangements, probably more than 10 people responsible.
退票量一上来，只能全公司会退票的人员集中在一起，二三十来人24小时待命处理。
On the return of tickets, only the whole company will refund the personnel together, some 20 or 30 people on standby 24 hours.
突然之间翻好几倍的退改，你眼睁睁地只能看着电脑上三个字——待处理，另一边还得心平气和地去和客户解释。
Suddenly you have to look at three words on the computer -- to be processed -- and explain them calmly to your customers.
最难退改的是境外业务，国内有免退改政策，航空公司会退给我们，但像美国、欧洲等，当地没有疫情爆发，也不会理解免费退改。
The hardest thing to undo is the overseas business, where there is a policy of exemption, airlines will give us back, but like the United States, Europe and so on, there is no outbreak of disease there, and will not understand the free withdrawal.
比如客户从北京飞到旧金山，这个机票也许能免费退改，但是在美国当地订的行程，资源方就不会退，而这些占业务的百分之二十。
For example, when a customer flies from Beijing to San Francisco, the ticket may be refunded free of charge, but resources do not return on locally booked trips in the United States, which account for 20 per cent of the business.
我一直很担忧上下游链条，我们都是一条线上的蚂蚱。
I've always been worried about the chain up and down, We're all grasshoppers on a line.
上游是客户在1月20号出行的账，已经飞了，钱还没回到我们这儿。
Upstream is the account for the trip on January 20th, which has already flown, and the money has not returned to us.
下游是航空公司的退款，很难保证所有航空公司的现金流都充分。
Downstream is the airline's refund, which makes it difficult to guarantee that all airlines have sufficient cash flow.
若发生系统性的崩溃，我们掏出去的押金和机票近2亿元，可能就回不来。
In the event of a systemic meltdown, we take out nearly $200 million in deposits and airline tickets and may not be able to return.
▲受疫情影响，近日来大批次航班被取消。
Influenced by the outbreak, a large number of flights have been cancelled in recent days.
图 / 网络这几天有时会非常恍惚、迷茫，一直在思考怎么面对接下来的事。
The graph / network can be very trance-like and confused these days, thinking about how to face the next thing.
比如能不能从政府那里获得一些支持，比如贷款、房租、税收方面。
For example, can you get some support from the government, such as loans, rent, taxes.
甚至想到如果说旅游行业停摆一年怎么办，我们要不要转做别的？昨天电话会议里还在讨论员工工资问题。
Even to think about what to do if the travel industry is suspended for a year, whether we should switch to something else? Yesterday's conference call was about staff salaries.
我没想过都按最低标准去发工资，700多人的团队，很多人有家庭，有房贷车贷。
I never thought about paying the minimum wage, a team of more than 700 people, many with families and mortgage loans.
而且这段时间，员工出去也不可能找到工作。
And during this time, it's impossible for employees to find a job outside.
最近有城市出台政策，让我们很敏感，说是家里有未成年人的可以一人在家照顾小孩，企业主支付正常工资。
Recently, some cities have introduced policies that make us sensitive that a person with a minor in the family can take care of the child alone and that the business owner pays normal wages.
在我看来，这个成本的锅等于让企业主背，现在最怕政策是要加负，而不是豁免。
In my view, this cost pot is tantamount to letting the business owners back, now the most afraid of the policy is to add burden, not immunity.
真怕啊，无法支撑到半年。
I'm afraid it won't last six months.
有时我想到最坏的结果是，优化人员，留下骨干。
Sometimes I think the worst-case scenario is to optimize the staff and leave the backbone.
再不然，重新创业。
Otherwise, start your own business again.
这个春节，员工群里红包都没怎么发，以前会发几十万，今年是祝贺还是不祝贺，反正都尴尬，只能给大家提士气。
This Spring Festival, the staff did not send a lot of red envelopes, will send hundreds of thousands of people, this year is a congratulations or not, anyway embarrassed, can only give everyone morale.
好在我还算是一个抱有积极期待的人。
Fortunately, I am still a positive expectation of the people.
我仔细研究了非典时期行业的情况，2003年是一个低谷，到2004年井喷，一些公司因此也乘风而上。
I looked closely at the SARS industry, which was at a low point in 2003, and by 2004 some companies were riding on the bandwagon.
而非典期间，国家会对部分行业实行税费减免等政策。
During SARS, the state will implement tax relief and other policies for some industries.
我总想练好内功很重要，利用空档把之前忽视的问题补上。
I always want to practice good internal work is very important, use slots to make up for previously neglected problems.
比如，员工素质技能培训，年前也没来得及做。
For example, the staff quality skills training, not even before the year before.
2月9号上班，先从这件事开始吧。
Feb. 9. Start with this thing.
