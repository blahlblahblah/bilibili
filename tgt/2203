23.02.2020本文字数：3266，阅读时长大约5.5分钟导读：这个原本答案写在机构设置方案里的简单问题，却成了数十万中国疾控人的灵魂拷问。
This simple question, written in institutional settings, has become the soul test of hundreds of thousands of Chinese disease controllers.
作者 | 第一财经马晓华面对突发公共卫生事件，我们的疾病预防控制部门能做什么？可做到怎样？这个原本答案写在机构设置方案里的简单问题，却成了数十万中国疾控人的灵魂拷问。
What can our disease prevention and control department do in the face of a public health emergency? What can be done? This simple question, written in the agency's design, has become the soul torture of hundreds of thousands of Chinese disease controllers.
更尴尬的是，这一拷问，在2003年SARS爆发时已经提出，17年后新冠肺炎疫情肆虐的今天，依然无人可答。
More awkwardly, the torture, which was proposed when the SARS outbreak erupted in 2003, remains unanswered 17 years later.
这次疫情发生后，有人翻出去年全国两会期间，全国政协委员、中国疾控中心（CDC）主任高福对一众媒体说的话：“SARS类事件不会再有了。
"SARS will not happen again," Gao Fu, a member of the CPPCC and director of the China CDC, told a gathering of media during the National People's Congress last year.
因为我国的传染病防控体系已经建设得很好，病毒来了我们可以挡住它。
Because our infectious disease control system is well established, we can stop the virus when it comes.
”没想到，“打脸”来得如此之快。
"I didn't think it would come so soon.
从2019年12月12日收到新冠肺炎的第一个病例，到2月22日24时，全国累计报告确诊病例76936例，累计死亡病例2442例(数据来自国家卫健委网站)。
The first case of pneumonia was received on 12 December 2019, and by 2400 hours on 22 February, a cumulative total of 76,936 confirmed cases and 2,442 cumulative deaths had been reported nationwide (data from the National Board of Health website).
不能否认包括疾控部门在内各环节的努力和取得的成效，但这次疫情从预警到防控，都存在诸多欠缺，也是不争的事实。
We cannot deny the efforts and achievements of all links, including the disease control departments, but there are many deficiencies in this epidemic from early warning to prevention and control, which is an indisputable fact.
在接受第一财经采访时，原中国疾控中心副主任杨功焕甚至认为，“中国疾控”的功能定位不清，又面临人才不足等困难，这些决定了它难以在应对突发公共卫生事件时发挥应有的作用。
In an interview with First Finance, Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the China CDC, even argued that the unclear function of CDC and the shortage of qualified personnel make it difficult for CDC to play its due role in responding to public health emergencies.
那么，这一尴尬又是怎样形成的？该如何破解？没有牙齿的大猫？早在1982年，当时的卫生部决定成立中国预防医学中心，后于1983年改称中国预防医学科学院。
So how did this embarrassment come about? How to crack it? The toothless big cat? As early as 1982, the then Ministry of Health decided to establish the China Preventive Medicine Center, which was renamed the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine in 1983.
中国预防医学中心的成立，标志着中国建立了从国家预防医学中心到省、地、县级卫生防疫站，再到乡镇卫生院和街道医院、村卫生室，以及各级各类专科防治站，共同组成的国家疾病预防控制体系。
The establishment of the China Preventive Medicine Centre marks the establishment of a national disease prevention and control system, which includes the State Preventive Medicine Centre, provincial, prefectural and county-level sanitary epidemic prevention stations, township hospitals, street hospitals and village health clinics, as well as specialized prevention and control stations at all levels.
2002年1月23日，中国预防医学科学院正式更名为中国疾病预防控制中心。
On January 23, 2002, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine was renamed the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
同时成立的还有中国卫生监督中心。
The China Health Supervision Center was also established.
这意味着中国新型的疾病预防控制体系逐步形成。
This means that China's new disease prevention and control system is gradually taking shape.
这个时候的中国公共卫生系统由各级医疗行政部门、医院、疾病预防与控制机构、卫生监督机构等组成。
At this time, China's public health system consists of all levels of medical administration, hospitals, disease prevention and control agencies, and health supervision institutions.
第二年(2003年)就爆发了SARS，中国的新发传染病防控体系随之开始建构，疾控体系也由此被重视。
SARS broke out the following year (2003), China's new infectious disease prevention and control system began to be built, the disease control system was also attached importance.
当时提出了3年内建立健全疾病预防控制体系的要求，各级疾控中心的财政投入迅速增加，疾控中心硬件条件大幅改善。
At that time, three years to establish a sound disease prevention and control system requirements, CDC financial input at all levels rapidly increased, CDC hardware conditions greatly improved.
截止到2004年末，全国各地的疾控中心（防疫站）共有3586个，加上预防保健中心，在编人员约21万人。
By the end of 2004, there were 3,586 disease control centers (CDC) nationwide, plus preventive health centers with a staff of about 210,000.
此后10年，疾控体系的人员编制没有实质性变化。
There was no substantial change in the staffing of the CDC system over the next 10 years.
杨功焕认为，即便再加上粗略估算大致相等的临时员工，中国每万人对应疾控部门的人数，也是很低的。
Even with roughly equal numbers of temporary workers, the number of people in China's disease-control department is low for every 10,000 people, Mr. Yang says.
同时，各级疾控部门还存在专业人才匮乏、全能型人才比例不足的人才“假饱和”现象。
At the same time, disease control departments at all levels still have a shortage of professional personnel, the proportion of all-round talent "pseudo-saturation" phenomenon.
而许多地方的疾控中心、卫生监督机构，面临人员待遇、机构属性、发展前景的困惑，骨干人员流失现象愈演愈烈，有的县疾控中心已经十多年没有录用专业人员，疾控队伍正在面临空心化危险。
However, in many places, the CDC and the health supervision institutions are faced with confusion over the treatment of personnel, their attributes and their development prospects.
在这一局面下，四级国家卫生防疫体系日益脆弱，而原有的三级基层医疗预防保健网也在逐步瓦解，“重医轻防、重有偿轻无偿、重收益多轻收益少”的现象突出，疾病预防体系之虚弱，大有退步至SARS之前水平的趋势。
In this situation, the four-level national health and epidemic prevention system is becoming increasingly fragile, and the existing three-tier primary health-care and preventive health-care network is gradually disintegrating.
另有值得一提的是，疾控部门其实是没有牙齿的大猫，它在遇到突发公共卫生事件时，是不能直接发布疫情通报的。
It is also worth mentioning that the CDC is a big toothless cat, it is not able to directly announce the outbreak in the event of public health emergencies.
为什么？杨功焕解释，是因为中国的疾控机构不属于行政部门，而是事业单位，所以没有权力来发布疫情信息。
Why? Mr Yang explains that China's CDC is not an agency of the executive branch, but an institution, so it has no power to disseminate information about the epidemic.
去年4月22日，十三届全国人大常委会第十次会议分组审议《关于医师队伍管理情况和执业医师法实施情况的报告》时，全国人大常委会副委员长陈竺就提出，要高度重视疾病预防控制体系职能在事业单位改革中被弱化的风险，尽快明晰各级疾控中心功能定位。
On April 22 last year, the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress examined the Report on the Administration of Physicians and the Implementation of the Law on Medical Practitioners, Vice Chairman Chen Zhu of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress said that great importance should be attached to the risk of weakening the functions of disease prevention and control systems in public institutions.
改革之辩尽管预防为主是新中国成立以来我国卫生和健康工作始终不变的方针，但长期以来，重医疗轻公卫的倾向，一直没有能够得到纠正，个中缘由让人唏嘘。
Debate on Reform Although prevention has always been the policy of health and health work in China since the founding of New China, the tendency of giving priority to medical care over public health has not been corrected for a long time.
上述全国人大常委审议的《报告》指出，自2018年新一轮机构改革以来，一些省份对包括疾控中心在内的各类事业单位进行优化整合，个别省份大部分地级市及所有县级疾控中心实行与其他事业单位整合的模式，部分归属国家卫生健康委领导，部分由政府直接领导，打破了过去自上而下的疾控服务体系链条。
The report, considered by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, noted that since the 2018 round of institutional reform, some provinces have optimized the integration of various institutions, including the CDC, with most prefectural cities and all county-level CDC models of integration with other public institutions, partly under the leadership of the NCHC and partly directly under the government, breaking the previous chain of top-down CDC systems.
此外，行政事业性收费政策取消后，一些地方政府尚没有建立对疾控长期稳定的投入保障机制，疾控机构人员薪酬明显低于同级公立医院，导致人才流失严重。
In addition, after the abolition of the administrative institutional fee policy, some local governments have not yet established an input safeguard mechanism for the long-term stability of disease control.
之前兜底的“三级医疗预防保健网”基本上不复存在，取而代之的是“三级医疗卫生服务网”，淡化了其预防保健职能。
The primary health-care network, formerly known as the Tertiary Health Care Network, has been replaced by the Tertiary Health Care Network, diluting its preventive health-care functions.
一些业内人士认为，这种做法是非常值得商榷的。
Some industry insiders believe that the practice is highly debatable.
这些改革，实际上主要是由医疗领域的专家建议的，而这些专家“没有一个能把疾控说清楚”。
These reforms were, in fact, recommended mainly by experts in the medical field, who "do not have a clear idea of what to do with the disease."
杨功焕认为，把公共卫生、疾控、医疗等都放在一起，自然就混乱了。
Yang thinks, put public health, disease control, medical treatment etc. together, natural chaos.
尤其是传染病的预防控制，与慢病防控、职业卫生、营养卫生，都是不太一样的，不能放在一起。
In particular, the prevention and control of infectious diseases, with chronic disease prevention and control, occupational health, nutrition and hygiene, are not the same, cannot be put together.
在新发传染病和已知传染病疫情不断发生且无国界的今天，如何及时发现和预警，及早采取行动，是现阶段疾病预防控制的重大任务和挑战。
In today's world of emerging infectious diseases and known infectious diseases, how to detect, warn and take early actions in a timely manner is a major task and challenge for disease prevention and control at this stage.
在经历SARS惨痛教训后，中国加大了对传染病防控体系的建设，将重大传染病防治专项作为“十一五”以来的16个重大科技专项之一，并列入《国家中长期科学和技术发展纲要》。
In the wake of the SARS tragedy, China has strengthened its system for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, making the prevention and control of major infectious diseases one of the 16 major scientific and technological projects since the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period, and has included it in the National Program for Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development.
浙江大学汇集力量建设了传染病诊治国家重点实验室。
Zhejiang University has built a national key laboratory for infectious disease diagnosis and treatment.
然而，实际上，传染病防控这块工作，还是与公共卫生放在一起的。
In practice, however, the prevention and control of infectious diseases is linked to public health.
杨功焕建议，将传染病防控与慢病防控、大卫生等分离出来，要有一个传染病防控的核心队伍，同时跟医院、社区卫生服务中心，以及研究所、大学形成网络。
Yang suggested separating infectious disease control from chronic diseases, general hygiene and so on, and having a core team of infectious disease prevention and control, as well as networking with hospitals, community health service centers, research institutes and universities.
因为传染病的病原学研究、检测手段研究，包括流行病学的一些深度研究模型，需要有基础的研究支持和信息支持。
Because the etiology of infectious diseases, detection means of research, including some in-depth epidemiological research models, need basic research support and information support.
而一旦发生传染病疫情，它还会涉及到医疗资源调配、物资调动、后勤保障等。
Once the outbreak of infectious diseases, it will also involve the deployment of medical resources, material transfer, logistics and so on.
所以，“它需要被放到行政系统里去，是个行政部门”。
So, "it needs to be put in the administrative system, it's an executive branch."
“把专业技术人员的工作和政府的行政管理完全分开，这样做是有些不合理的。
"It is not reasonable to separate the work of professional and technical personnel from the administration of government.
如果参照其他国家，会发现没有这样二元的做法。
If one looks at other countries, one finds that there is no such duality.
美国疾控中心只有国家一级，在州以下它就是卫生局，所有的疾控任务都是卫生局的人在做。
CDC is only national, and below the state level it is the health department, and all disease control tasks are done by health officials.
”杨功焕接着表示，“我们应该把疾控工作详细分解，把一些部门合并到卫生局，这样的话，卫生局就不仅是一个行政管理部门，就像公安局也会有很多刑侦技术人员一样。
"We should break down the disease control work in detail and merge some departments into the Health Bureau so that it is not just an administrative department, just as the Public Security Bureau has a lot of forensic technicians," he added.
”综合大考尽管我国已建立从国家到县级的自上而下四级疾病防控网络体系,建成了全球规模最大、覆盖面最广的传染病网络直报系统，但在突发疫情面前，依然颇显被动。
Although China has established a top-down four-tier disease prevention and control network system from the national to the county level, and has built the world's largest and most extensive direct reporting system for infectious diseases, it remains passive in the face of sudden outbreaks.
主要原因除了前文所述之外，还有卫生应急指挥决策体系运转效率较低的因素。
In addition to the foregoing, there are factors that contribute to the inefficient functioning of the health emergency command and decision-making system.
杨功焕认为，公共卫生突发事件的应对，一定是要协同所有支持系统和力量的，但从此次新冠肺炎疫情之初的应对来看，显然是有问题的。
Yang believed that the response to public health emergencies must be coordinated with all support systems and forces, but from the initial response to the outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia, is clearly problematic.
回顾国内历年发生的重特大突发公共卫生事件，无论是疫情还是自然灾害，都能发现卫生应急指挥决策体系的不足。
We can find the deficiency of the decision-making system of health emergency command and decision-making by reviewing the major public health emergencies that have occurred in China in recent years, whether outbreaks occur or natural disasters.
中国在突发公共卫生事件的处理上，往往只是建立一个临时性的突发疫情应急指挥中心，让从各相关部门临时抽调的人员进行部署落实。
In dealing with public health emergencies, China often only establishes a temporary emergency command center for sudden outbreaks of disease, allowing personnel temporarily seconded from relevant departments to be deployed.
由于各个部门的工作机制不同，难以同步，势必导致协调不畅，直接影响应急决策和处置的效率。
It is difficult to keep pace with the different working mechanisms of different departments, which will lead to poor coordination and directly affect the efficiency of emergency decision-making and disposal.
此次新冠肺炎疫情之初的各地表现，也再次凸显各地在应急指挥决策系统建设方面的进度不一和水平参差不齐。
This outbreak of new crown pneumonia at the beginning of the performance, but also highlights once again in the emergency command and decision-making system in the construction of uneven progress and level.
除此之外，另有专家认为，应急资金投入不足，风险意识不够强，也是应急能力不足的重要原因。
In addition, other experts believe that emergency funding is insufficient, risk awareness is not strong enough, is also an important reason for inadequate emergency response capacity.
公共卫生服务被认为是一项由政府向全体居民提供的社会公益性事业，对各类疾病预防和控制具有重要作用。
Public health service is regarded as a public welfare undertaking provided by the government to the whole population and plays an important role in the prevention and control of various diseases.
政府对公共卫生应急资金投入的充足与否，在一定程度上影响着卫生应急管理机制的建立与完善，也对促进基本医疗卫生服务均等化起着关键作用。
The adequacy of the government's emergency funding for public health to a certain extent affects the establishment and improvement of the health emergency management mechanism and plays a key role in promoting the equalization of basic medical and health services.
有统计数据显示，2010～2016年中国公共卫生总投入虽逐年增加，但占卫生总费用的比重却几乎未变；2003～2013年间中国城乡人均卫生费用相差4倍，同时部分省份的投入结构不合理(引自论文《中国卫生应急管理发展现状及面临挑战》，作者屈腾佼等，2019年8月)。
Statistics show that total public health spending in China increased year by year from 2010 to 2016, but its share of total health expenditure remained almost unchanged; between 2003 and 2013, the difference between urban and rural per capita health expenditure was four times greater, while the input structure in some provinces was unreasonable (cited in The Current Situation and Challenges of Health Emergency Management in China, Qu Tengkai et al., August 2019).
政府对于公共卫生投入的不足，必然影响到传染病监测预警、应急演练、宣传教育、应急物资储备等方面工作。
The inadequacy of government investment in public health inevitably affects the monitoring and early warning of infectious diseases, emergency drills, publicity and education, and the stockpiling of emergency supplies.
在一些财政保障能力欠缺的欠发达地区，这方面影响尤其明显。
The impact is particularly pronounced in less developed regions where financial security capacity is inadequate.
这次世所罕见的新冠肺炎疫情，既是一场科学和经济实力的大考，也是一场国家治理能力的大考。
This rare outbreak of New Crown Pneumonia is not only a major test of scientific and economic strength, but also a major test of national governance.
但愿我们从个人到各类组织机构，从疾控系统到其他政府部门，都能认真应考，考出好成绩。
Hopefully, we will be able to take the examinations seriously, from individuals to organizations and institutions, from the disease control system to other government departments.
