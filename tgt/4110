事态还在发展，一日多变，州、县、市都发了紧急状态令，3月18日，本地所有餐馆被要求关闭堂吃，一大批员工失业，生计成为问题，政府救济在途。
Events continued to unfold, with states, counties and cities issuing emergency orders, all local restaurants being ordered to close down on March 18, a large number of workers being laid off, livelihoods being in question and government relief on the way.
黎明之前将会有一段至暗时刻。
There will be a dark hour before dawn.
我们也只有就地卧倒，保护自己，共渡难关了。
We had to lie down on the spot, protect ourselves and tide over the difficulties together.
文 |胡　健我们所居住的美国南卡罗来纳州的查尔斯顿是一座历史老城，紧邻大西洋，水草丰美，先前也曾阔过。
Charleston, South Carolina, is an old historic city that borders the Atlantic Ocean and has had plenty of grass and water before.
《飘》时代曾与波士顿、纽约、费城齐名，并因其在南方，气候温暖，更适合农作物生长，种植园主财大气粗到可以向北方初兴的工业城市叫板。
The Gone With the Wind era, which was once synonymous with Boston, New York and Philadelphia, and because it was in the south, it had a warmer climate and was better suited to growing crops.
南北战争的第一枪就在这里发生，战火烧了四年，南方邦联战败。
It was here that the first shots of the Civil War were fired. Four years later the Confederacy was defeated.
查尔斯顿遭到屠城般的清洗，被大工业时代的班车甩下，停留在农耕社会，慢节奏，对外面的世界认知不多，容易满足，友善到傻白甜。
Charleston was slaughtered, thrown off the wagon of the great industrial age, stuck in a farming society, slow-paced, with little knowledge of the outside world, easy to satisfy, friendly to dumb sweet.
小城入选2020南方最易居城市的秀丽影像整整一个月，当我们每天捏着手机，云操心大洋彼岸新冠疫情，被大量中文信息浸染，心情焦虑的时候，这里风清云淡。
The city was chosen as the most livable city in the south of 2020 for a whole month. As we held mobile phones every day, clouds worried about the New Crown outbreak on the other side of the ocean, being inundated with Chinese messages and feeling anxious.
老百姓更关心下一届谁当总统，谁更代表他们的利益。
The people are more concerned about who will be the next president and who will represent their interests more.
2020年是选举年，查尔斯顿又一次成为历史舞台。
The year 2020 is an election year, and Charleston is once again on the scene.
2月25日，民主党把初选投票前最后一场七名候选人辩论会放在查尔斯顿学院。
On February 25, Democrats placed the last of seven candidates' debates before the primary election at Charleston College.
2月28日，谋求连任的共和党候选人特朗普也来北查尔斯顿集会演讲。
On February 28, Republican candidate Trump also made a speech at a rally in North Charleston.
2月28日，特朗普曾到北查尔斯顿演讲电视上看到大会堂里挤挤攘攘成千上万激动的支持者，已经自觉与人群保持距离的我们感叹：“这样太危险了！谁能保证其中没有带病毒者？”目测我们身边大多数人还是从选战中得知新冠病毒的。
On February 28, Trump visited North Charleston to see the bustle and bustle of his supporters in the General Assembly Hall, and we have consciously distanced ourselves from the crowd: "This is too dangerous! Who can guarantee that there are no infected people?"
因为两党都把逐渐显现的疫情作为攻击对方的弹药。
Because both parties use the unfolding epidemic as ammunition to attack each other.
民主党指责特朗普政府不作为。
Democrats accuse the Trump administration of inaction.
而特朗普曾坚称：新冠疫情风险很低很低，就像流感，流感每年还袭击美国几千万人，死数万人呢。
Trump, for his part, has insisted that the risk of a new crown epidemic is low, like the flu, which strikes tens of millions of Americans every year and kills tens of thousands of people.
再说，我们拥有世界上最伟大的专家在应对，多洗手吧！进入3月，美国确诊人数陡坡式增加。
Plus, we have some of the world's greatest experts on hand-washing. In March, the number of people diagnosed in the United States increased steeply.
人们发现“最伟大的专家”与总统特朗普调子不一样。
One finds that the "greatest expert" is not the same as President Trump.
疾控中心专家在接受电视采访时说：“疫情在美国蔓延已经不可避免，只是时间问题。
"It's just a matter of time before an outbreak is inevitable in the United States," CDC expert told television.
”3月9日，美股在连跌几天后出现几十年来的第一次熔断。
On March 9, US stocks suffered their first meltdown in decades after falling for several days.
资本家出身的特朗普可以轻视科学，但经济下行立刻让他变了脸色。
Trump, a capitalist by birth, could despise science, but the economic downturn immediately changed his face.
3月11日晚上，他正襟危坐在椭圆办公室，向全国发表电视讲话，主题是新冠疫情。
On the evening of 11 March, he was sitting in the Oval Office, delivering a televised address to the nation on the subject of the New Crown Epidemic.
在一个小时的讲话中，第一次不骂民主党，第一次像严肃的总统，并从这天起不再类比流感。
For the first time in an hour's speech, he did not scold the Democrats, for the first time as a serious president, and from that day on no analogy with flu.
特朗普发表电视讲话　图｜CNN截屏与他的讲话抢头条的还有更惊动普通美国人的消息：NBA暂停本赛季所有比赛。
The headline grabbing his speech by Trump's televised speech was accompanied by news that the NBA has suspended all competition this season.
美国有线广播电视网主持人叹道：美国人的生活从今晚开始改变了。
CNN anchorman laments: Life in America has changed since tonight.
可是，查尔斯顿人仍然后知后觉。
The Charleston people, however, are still backward-looking.
3月12日，我与本地出生长大的白人女子聊天。
On March 12, I was chatting with a white woman who had been born and raised in the area.
她24岁，本地大学毕业后在一家幼儿园当老师，平时喜欢追中国剧，以前跟我探讨过《甄嬛传》。
She was 24 years old and worked as a kindergarten teacher after her local university. She liked to play Chinese opera and had discussed Zhen Huan with me before.
我问：“你担心新冠疫情吗？” 每天换乘两趟公交车上班的她说：“我不担心，我洗手。
I asked, "Are you worried about a new crown?" She said, as she commutes to work twice a day: "I don't worry.
我也基本不旅行。
I hardly travel, either.
也许我男朋友会得，他的工作与外国人打交道。
Maybe my boyfriend will get his job dealing with foreigners.
如果他得了希望不要传染给我。
Don't give it to me if he's got hope.
”3月12日，我和一名白人女子在这里聊天　摄｜胡健虽然我满怀忧虑，但也不想危言耸听，于是引用了美国政府所给予的提示说：“你们年轻，得了也会很快痊愈的。
On March 12, I was talking with a white woman here, and although I was worried, I didn't want to sound alarmist, so I quoted a hint from the United States Government: "You are young, and you will soon recover.
”她说：“是的，我们会在医院得到很好的治疗对待。
"Yes, we will be treated very well in the hospital," she said.
”真是一颗平常心哦，看来是不知道大暴发时医疗资源有可能被挤兑。
What a common sense, it seems, is not to know that a run on medical resources is possible in a major outbreak.
我再问：“昨晚特朗普总统向全国的讲话看了吗？”“没有。
I asked again: "Did President Trump address the nation last night?" "No.
我不喜欢他！”“那下任总统候选人中你更倾向于谁？”“桑德斯。
I don't like him! Who do you prefer among the next presidential candidates? Sanders.
我已经两次投他了。
I've voted for him twice.
因为他当选将没有学贷。
Because he won't have a school loan.
”2月26日，桑德斯（右）在南卡罗来纳州默特尔海滩举行竞选活动“是啊，很多年轻人支持他。
On Feb. 26, Saunders (right) campaigned on Myrtle Beach, South Carolina "Yes, a lot of young people supported him.
听说现在美国大学生的学贷要到四十岁才能还清。
It is said that American college students can not repay their loans until they are forty years old.
”我说道。
'I said.
“要还到死去。
"To die.
因为毕业工作挣钱还要付房租、食物，至少五十年才能还清。
Because I have to pay rent, food and pay it back at least fifty years after graduation.
”“你不怕他把社会主义带到这里？”“不怕。
"You are not afraid that he will bring socialism here?
我喜欢社会主义，像加拿大一样，免费医疗。
I like socialism, like Canada, free medical care.
”无学贷，免费医疗，在相对贫穷落后的老南方，应付日常开销似比潜行的病毒更有危机感。
Loans, free health care, and in the relatively poor and backward old South, coping with daily expenses seems more dangerous than sneaking viruses.
再说，查尔斯顿确诊病例不高，至3月16日仅一例，轻度症状，被隔离在家。
Moreover, the number of confirmed cases in Charleston was low, with only one case on 16 March, mild symptoms and isolation at home.
有人用当地产的甜草编玫瑰、篮子等摆摊出售，很有老南方特色　摄｜胡健但流行病学专家的预测数字越来越吓人。
There are local sweet straw roses, baskets, etc. on sale, quite old southern, but epidemiologists are predicting increasingly scary numbers.
当地医院开通了网上问诊系统。
An online consultation system has been set up in local hospitals.
所有自感不适的人被要求先上指定网站登记信息，接受评估咨询，一般被医嘱在家休息喝水吃药。
All those who feel self-conscious are required to register for a designated website, receive assessment counselling, and are generally instructed to rest at home, drink water and take medication.
如果病史触发新冠预警，则进入下一程序，去搭建在市郊大型停车场上的帐篷点。
If a medical history triggers a Crown alert, go to the next step and set up a tent on a large parking lot on the outskirts of the city.
病人不需要下车，只是打开车窗露出头部，由身穿防护服的医务人员采样，然后回家等结果。
The patient did not need to get out of the car, but only to open the window and show his head, be sampled by medical personnel in protective clothing and go home.
如果阳性，也不一定入院治疗。
If they are positive, they are not necessarily hospitalized.
轻症患者被隔离在家，等自然康复。
Patients with mild illness are isolated at home, waiting for a natural recovery.
危重症才送医院，把有限的医疗资源让给最需要的人，最大程度挽救生命。
Critical cases are sent to hospitals, where limited medical resources are ceded to those most in need and lives are saved to the greatest extent possible.
设在大型停车场上的帐篷检测点　摄｜胡健全美疫情数字持续以几何级数往上跳。
+ 12 + + + + + + + + + + The figures for the US epidemic continue to jump geometrically, at a tent detection point on a large parking lot.
3月13日，“黑色星期五”，一个西俗中不吉利的日子，下午三点多，特朗普迫于局势，宣布美国进入新冠疫情暴发紧急状态。
On March 13, "Black Friday," an unlucky day in Western custom, Trump was forced by events to declare a state of emergency in the United States.
淡定的老南方也欠起身子。
The quiet old South also stooped.
3月15日下午4点，南卡州长顶不住压力，终于宣布所有学校停课。
At 4 p.m. on 15 March, Governor Nanka, under pressure, finally declared all schools closed.
在这之前已有19个州宣布关闭学校，南卡教师工会以保护教师的名义要求停课，联署签名数千人。
Nineteen states had already announced the closure of schools, and the Nanka Teachers' Union had suspended classes in the name of protecting teachers, co-signing thousands.
当天大半个美国关闭了学校。
The school was closed for most of the day.
关闭大学操作上相对简单，而中小学牵涉面就大了。
Closing universities is relatively easy, and schools are being referred to schools.
校车出动提供公共wifi网络，以便学生上网课12岁以下的孩子单独留在家里，法律方面有限制。
There are legal restrictions on the use of public wifi networks to allow children under the age of 12 to stay at home alone.
因此，家长也得跟着停工回家监护。
Therefore, the parents have to follow the work stoppage home supervision.
这里又牵涉到钱的问题，谁来承担？不去工作，就拿不到钱，而大多数美国家庭拿不出500美元以上的生活备用金，房贷、车贷等着付，生计立马成问题。
It's a question of money, who's going to take it? Without work, they can't get paid, and most American families can't afford to pay more than $500 in cash, and with mortgages and car loans waiting to be paid, livelihoods are at stake.
带薪休假？中小企业主也背不起呀。
Paid vacation? Small and medium-sized enterprises owners can not afford it.
网课也会让一部分学生掉队。
Online classes can also leave some students behind.
因为有些家庭根本没有电脑，没有网络。
Because some families do not have computers at all, no network.
最关键的是低收入家庭的孩子可能要饿肚子了。
Crucially, children in low-income families may go hungry.
这些孩子的免费早午餐本来是通过学校供应的，政府没有把这笔补贴给他们的父母，估计是怕被挪作他用，甚至被拿去买酒买毒品。
The children's free brunch was supposed to be provided through the school, and the Government did not give the allowance to their parents, presumably for fear of being diverted and even being taken to buy alcohol for drugs.
停课后贫困孩子的吃饭问题成为电视新闻直播间各路嘉宾的讨论话题。
The problem of feeding poor children after school suspension has become a topic of discussion among the guests in the TV news studio.
解决方案很快公布。
The solution will be announced soon.
学校继续提供免费早午餐，由校车送到沿线站点，家长也可以开车到指定学校领取。
Schools continue to provide free brunch, which is transported by school bus to stations along the route, and parents can drive to designated schools to collect them.
给孩子发放免费早午餐送餐现场没有口罩，事实上整个查尔斯顿地区几乎没有见到路人戴口罩。
Free brunch was given to children without face masks, and virtually no passers-by were seen wearing masks throughout Charleston.
商店里的口罩早在一月底就被热心华人买空，运去中国了。
The masks were bought by enthusiastic Chinese as early as the end of January and shipped to China.
现在库存供应医护人员都不够，政府与专家都建议健康民众不要戴口罩。
There is a shortage of health care workers in stock, and the government and experts are advising healthy people not to wear masks.
事态还在发展，一日多变，州、县、市都发了紧急状态令，3月18日，本地所有餐馆被要求关闭堂吃，19日，公共图书馆关闭，20日，公园关闭，一大批员工失业，生计成为问题，政府救济在途。
On March 18th, all local restaurants were ordered to close down the church. On March 19th, the public library was closed. On the 20th, the park was closed, a large number of employees lost their jobs, livelihood became a problem and government relief was on the way.
黎明之前将会有一段至暗时刻。
There will be a dark hour before dawn.
我们也只有就地卧倒，保护自己，共渡难关了。
We had to lie down on the spot, protect ourselves and tide over the difficulties together.
南卡州因失业而去申请领取失业保险的人增加了400%·专访｜坂本龙一：人类是稍微偏离自然轨道的、有点坏掉的猴子·不顾世卫组织纠正，“中国病毒”成特朗普口头禅，有阴谋！·火线｜帮新冠肺炎重病人“熬病程”——专访国家卫健委专家组成员管向东教授新民周刊所有平台稿件，未经正式授权一律不得转载、出版、改编或进行与新民周刊版权相关的其他行为，违者必究。
South Carolina has increased by 400% the number of people who have lost their jobs to claim unemployment insurance: Human beings are slightly off-track, slightly damaged monkeys. Despite WHO corrections, the "Chinese virus" has become Trump's pet talk and intrigue!
