阻断新型冠状病毒引起的肺炎疫情的传播，公共交通工具的消毒防疫尤为重要。
To block the spread of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, disinfection and epidemic prevention of public transport is particularly important.
记者|刘朝晖今天，是春节后上海复工的第二周工作日的开始。
Liu Chaohui today, the start of the second week of work in Shanghai after the Spring Festival.
从2月10日复工开始，已经有很多人重返工作岗位，同时返沪的人也越来越多，上海市内公共交通的人流也会越来越密集。
Since resuming work on February 10, many people have returned to work, and more and more people are returning to Shanghai. Public transport within Shanghai will also become more crowded.
在当前上海疫情防控工作依然处于紧张进行的时期，选择公共交通出行上下班是不是安全，是很多人心中的疑问。
At a time when prevention and control of the epidemic in Shanghai is still at an intense stage, many people wonder whether it is safe to travel to and from work by public transport.
阻断新型冠状病毒引起的肺炎疫情的传播，公共交通工具的消毒防疫尤为重要。
To block the spread of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus, disinfection and epidemic prevention of public transport is particularly important.
根据记者的实地探访和从地铁、公交、出租车三大行业获得的信息，上海公共交通行业已经对疫情防控进行了严密的部署，防控工作和消毒措施都有进一步的加强。
According to the journalists' on-the-spot visits and information from the subway, bus and taxi industries, the public transport industry in Shanghai has made strict arrangements for epidemic prevention and control, and control and disinfection measures have been further strengthened.
地铁：测温全路网覆盖早上8点，记者在3号线的上海火车站看到，在站外就设置了测温点，全身防护服的地铁工作人员严阵以待，对每一名进站的乘客都进行严格的体温测量。
At the Shanghai Railway Station on Line 3, a temperature measuring point was set up outside the station. The subway staff in full protective clothing stood ready to take a strict temperature check on every passenger entering the station.
现场工作人员说，根据市防控工作要求，一旦发现测温超过37.3℃的乘客，马上会立即呼叫当班站长，登记和上报乘客个人信息，实施分类管控，并转移乘客至隔离区进行体温复核，复核后拨打120至现场进行排查。
As soon as passengers with temperatures exceeding 37.3 degrees Celsius are found, the station master will be called immediately to register and report personal information, implement classification controls and transfer passengers to the area of separation for body temperature review, review and then dial 120 to the scene for screening, said site staff.
据了解，在1号线上海火车站站、上海南站站以及3号线上海火车站站、上海南站站，地铁方面均进行站外测温，车站通过调整部分出入口，实行单向通行，尽量避免乘客在室内聚集。
It is understood that the Shanghai Railway Station on Line 1, the Shanghai South Station on Line 3, the Shanghai Railway Station on Line 3 and the Shanghai South Station are all conducting temperature measurement outside the station.
工作人员在3号线上海火车站站对进站乘客进行测温为了确保轨道交通乘客出行安全，从2月12日起，上海地铁全网络（除11号线暂停运营三站外）共计412座站点均实施测温进站全覆盖。
In order to ensure the safety of rail transit passengers, a total of 412 stations on the Shanghai subway network (with the exception of line 11, which has been suspended for three stops) have been fully covered since February 12.
全网测温点共751个，其中，使用热成像仪224个点位，额温度计527个点位。
The total number of temperature measurement points is 751, of which 224 are thermal imagers and 527 are frontal thermometers.
而在近期节后返程客流逐日抵沪，本市机场、火车站等交通枢纽接待量日益提升的情况下，上海地铁在原有实施测温进站的基础上，由工作人员身穿专业防护服在轨交12座门户车站开展测温，为进站乘客进行体温筛查。
On the basis of the increase in the number of reception at the city's airports and railway stations, the Shanghai Metro is equipped with professional protective clothing to conduct temperature measurements at 12 portals at rail crossings and conduct temperature screening for inbound passengers on the basis of the existing implementation of temperature measurement stations.
目前上海地铁测温车站有两种“测温”方式，一种是“手持非接触式体温仪”，另一种是“非配合式热成像”体温测试系统。
At present, there are two ways to measure temperature in Shanghai metro stations, one is a hand-held non-contact thermometer and the other is an uncoordinated thermal imaging temperature test system.
使用“非配合式热成像”测温的车站，乘客无需停留，也不需工作人员上前执行测温操作，乘客在经过安检时便已同步进入测温范围，该系统即已对人员实施测温，工作人员通过屏幕便能直接获取体温值。
At the uncoordinated thermal imaging station, passengers do not have to stop or go to the front of the station to perform the temperature measurement. Passengers are synchronized into the temperature range when passing through the security check. The system has been used to measure the temperature of the staff, and the temperature value can be obtained directly from the screen.
测温如有超过标准值，将有警示音提醒工作人员。
Warnings will be sounded to alert staff if temperature measurements exceed the standard values.
地铁站内的“非配合式热成像”体温测试系统上海地铁方面表示，根据规定，测温车站每一小时都会对测温设备进行消毒。
According to the regulations, temperature measuring stations are disinfected every hour of the year, said Shanghai Metro, which runs a non-co-ordinated thermal imaging system.
从2月10日复工开始，地铁方面已经从每日对列车消毒一次，增加到每次高峰结束回库必须再封闭消毒。
Starting with the resumption of work on February 10, the subway has been disinfected once a day from the train, to the end of each peak must be re-closed and disinfected.
车站消毒频次增加到每天四次，乘客密切触碰的部位做到一小时一擦拭。
The frequency of station disinfection was increased to four times a day, with passengers touching the area tightly for an hour to clean it.
通风系统采取全新风工况，通风管路与滤网一周两次清洗消毒。
Ventilation system adopts all-new air condition, ventilation duct and filter net are cleaned and disinfected twice a week.
此外，遇到乘客突发疾病以及疑似、确诊病例信息通报立即采取加强站车彻底消毒措施。
In addition, in the event of a passenger sudden illness and suspected, confirmed case information to take immediate measures to strengthen the station vehicle thorough disinfection measures.
上海地铁工作人员在对地铁车厢进行消毒正值疫情期间，对于整个轨道交通路网来说客流量并不大，我们也提醒大家乘坐地铁时牢记上海地铁所倡导的五字诀：“全程戴口罩、进站测体温、人流避拥挤、出行请错峰、限流请配合。
Shanghai Metro staff are disinfecting metro carriages during the epidemic period. Passenger flow to the rail network is small. We also remind you to remember the five-word keys advocated by the Shanghai Metro: "Wear a mask, take temperature in the station, avoid congestion, travel peak, limit current.
”五字诀记于心，从而最大程度地确保地铁出行的安全。
Five-word keys are kept in mind to ensure the safety of subway trips to the maximum extent possible.
公交：重点线路每日消毒三次针对本市返程和复工客流高峰的到来，上海公交方面也严格执行疫情防控规范操作，实施了全天候、全过程、全覆盖“三全”管理，在做好运能调配的同时，切实加强了公交车辆消毒通风、枢纽站点乘客测温工作。

Key line of bus implementation three times a day disinfection reporters found that Jiushi bus to increase the public transport disinfection efforts, but also added a large electric sprayer on a number of public transport routes for pilot promotion.
据介绍，这种“新式武器”可以喷洒细小的新型消毒剂雾化颗粒，消毒因子能很好地悬浮在空气中，对有害微生物进行持续有效消杀，与原先人工喷洒模式相比，不仅加快消毒速度，提高消毒效率及安全系数，而且车内消毒覆盖面大大提高，无刺激味，减少乘客不适感。
According to the report, the "new weapon" can be sprayed with fine new disinfectant aerosol particles, disinfection factors can be well suspended in the air, and harmful micro-organisms can be effectively eliminated continuously.
公交人员使用大型电动喷雾器消毒在进行喷洒消毒的同时，公交工作人员还对车门把手、拉手、座椅靠背等关键接触部位，通过“擦拭法”利用新型消毒剂彻底除菌与清洁。

公交车厢擦拭消毒不留死角在公交枢纽设置的发热乘客临时安置点，张贴着明显识别标识和疾控中心的联系方式，并备有座椅、隔离设施与消毒用品等，由接受过专业培训专人管理。
Public transport carriages are cleaned and disinfected, no dead-end in the bus hub set up in the temporary accommodation of hot passengers, posted clearly identified signs and CDC contact information, equipped with seats, isolation facilities and disinfection supplies, etc. by specially trained personnel.
临时安置点避开了公交司乘调人员所在区域，距离乘客聚集的客流通道至少2米开外，以避免发热乘客经过时发生交叉感染。
Temporary settlements avoid areas where bus attendants are stationed and are located at least 2 metres away from passenger passageways in order to avoid cross-infection when passengers with fever pass by.
久事公交方面介绍，他们在各枢纽站发车点布置了1200块“上车戴口罩，防护你我他”的温馨提示标牌，友情提醒乘客做好自身防护工作。

The reporter understands that as early as the Spring Festival, Volkswagen has stepped up its management of entrances and exits before the Spring Festival, strengthening management and protection in key areas such as office areas and motorcades, focusing on ensuring disinfection and cleaning of vehicles and temperature testing of drivers.
在乘客需求量较大的“二场三站（上海2大机场3个火车站）”，大众出租租赁质检队还全员出动，全副武装，为候车的出租车进行“一车一清依次消毒”，引导乘客到已消毒的车辆上。
At the "two-stop-three-stop" (three railway stations at Shanghai's two largest airports), where passengers are in great demand, the VW rental quality inspection team has been fully deployed, fully armed, to "clean the waiting taxis one by one" and guide passengers to the disinfected vehicles.
