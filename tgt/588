编者按：这是一对父子。
Editor's Note: This is a father and son.
父亲赵华明是铁路上海客运段京沪车队的列车长。
His father Zhao Huaming was the conductor of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Passenger Section.
17年前非典时期，他跑1461/1462次京沪绿皮车。
Seventeen years ago, during the SARS period, he ran 1461 / 1462 Beijing-Shanghai green leather cars.
今年新型冠状病毒疫情之际，他仍出乘，跑临客，去重庆。
This year, when the new coronavirus epidemic, he is still out in the passenger run to Chongqing.
与17年前不同的是，当年在读小学的儿子赵程，如今已是上海瑞金医院北院的一名护士，目前正在武汉第三人民医院光谷院区参与新冠病毒肺炎重症患者的抢救工作。
Unlike 17 years ago, Zhao Cheng, who was a primary school student and is now a nurse in the northern courtyard of the Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai, is participating in the rescue work of patients with severe coronary pneumonia in the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan Third People's Hospital.
在家里喜添丁，宝宝还不满半岁时，新爷爷和新爸爸冲上了前线……口述 | 赵华明、赵　程整理 | 姜浩峰赵程和同事们出征武汉　图 |央视截屏赵华明：出乘，不惜租房与小孙孙隔离作为上海客运段职工，我长期在京沪车队工作。
At home, when Tim was at home and the baby was less than half a year old, the new grandfather and dad rushed to the front... Oral & # 45; Zhao Huaoming and his colleagues on a trip to Wuhan.
2003年非典时期，我跑北京。
I ran to Beijing during the SARS period in 2003.
那时候1461/1462次是没有空调的绿皮车。
At that time, 1461 / 1462 was a green leather car without air conditioning.
服务在一线，直面过疫情，那时的我还不是列车长，一直也没有退缩。
Service in the front line, face to face with the epidemic, then I was not the conductor, has not flinched.
现在我作为列车长，在疫情面前，就更应该带头做好榜样，做好列车的疫情防控工作，保障旅客的安全舒适出行。
Now as conductor, in the face of the epidemic situation, we should take the lead to do a good job in the prevention and control of the epidemic train, to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers travel.
这是我最大的责任。
This is my biggest responsibility.
我相信，经过我们的努力，一定能战胜疫情。
I believe that through our efforts, we will be able to overcome the epidemic.
2003年非典时期，铁路上海客运段职工做好出乘前防护工作　摄影 |张锦渭今年节后春运，赵华明列车长要求车班做好防护回看今年春节前，我值乘上海到成都的临客时，就感觉可能有较大疫情。
Before the Spring Festival this year, Zhao Huaming, the conductor, asked his shift to take precautions. Before the Spring Festival this year, when I was on my way to Chengdu as a passenger, I felt a possible major outbreak of the disease.
当时车队已经比较认真对待，段里、车队干部往返添乘，更是发了N95口罩和防护服以备不时之需。
At that time, the convoy has been more serious, the cadre of the convoy to and from the multiplication, but also N95 masks and protective clothing for use in case of need.
还发了体温表。
And a thermometer.
当时我测出过一个发热病人。
I picked up a feverish patient.
这人从杭州上车，当我测出此人在发烧时，立即采取了隔离措施。
The man got on the train from Hangzhou, and when I found out that the man had a fever, I immediately took measures to isolate him.
然后与新余站值班员联系，将这位旅客交给了新余站。
Then contact with the new station duty officer, the passenger handed over to Xinyu station.
列车继续运行，到半夜我手机上看到新闻说，新余出现一名新冠肺炎患者。
The train continued to run until midnight when I saw news on my cell phone that a new crowed pneumonia patient had appeared in Xinyu.
真是吓了一大跳。
It was a real shock.
设想，这么一来，整趟车的旅客、我们整个车班列车员、检车、乘警，包括实习生，一共40人都要隔离14天。
Imagine, then, that the entire train, our entire train crew, the police, including the interns, would be quarantined for 14 days.
当年非典时期，我们同跑北京车的同事就有被隔离的。
During the SARS period, our colleagues who ran in Beijing with us were isolated.
我们车班有个女实习生，和我儿子同名同姓，也叫赵程，是常州铁道高职的学生，“00后”，刚刚20岁，南京人。
Our class has a female intern, and my son of the same name, also known as Zhao Cheng, Changzhou railway students, "after 00," just 20 years old, Nanjing.
将心比心，如果出现什么情况，她父母能不着急吗？我马上打电话给新余站确认，还好新增病人不是我送到站方的那位，这才松口气。
If anything should happen, could her parents not worry? I called Xinyu station right away to confirm that the new patient was not the one I had sent to the station.
赵华明为乘客测量体温大年夜凌晨，临客到成都站。
Zhao Huaoming took the passenger's body temperature in the early morning.
大约3点15分，我接到家里电话。
At about 3: 15, I got a call from home.
妻子跟我说，儿子即将出发去武汉。
My wife told me that my son was leaving for Wuhan.
我儿子今年25岁，是瑞金医院北院的一名护士。
My son, 25, is a nurse in the North Hospital of Ruijin Hospital.
儿媳妇是他同事，也是护士。
His daughter-in-law is his colleague and nurse.
家里刚添了一个小孙孙，半岁还不到。
The family has just given birth to a little grandchild, half a year old.
说老实话，我有点着急。
To tell you the truth, I'm a little worried.
家里是这个情况，而疫情什么情况，我在外跑车又经历过非典，大致知道一些。
This is the case at home, and what the epidemic situation is, I have experienced SARS outside the sports car, roughly know something.
但定心想想，我还是支持儿子逆行武汉。
But I think, I still support my son retrograde Wuhan.
一方面，我知道，他毕业两年来，一直在医院ICU重症监护室当护士，这时候就该他这样的年轻人冲到第一线；另一方面，我感觉，医院的防护设备总要强过我们铁路单位，只要自己按照规章制度操作，应该能保证安全。
On the one hand, I knew that he had been working as a nurse in the ICU intensive care unit of the hospital for two years after graduation. On the other hand, I felt that the protective equipment of the hospital was better than that of our railway unit.
儿子在家待命几天后，于年初三前往武汉。
My son waited at home for a few days before leaving for Wuhan on the third day.
此后，我每天都会和他视频联线。
After that, I would have a video link with him every day.
譬如今天他是0点到4点的班，我就会在他下班后和他聊一下。
He works from 0 to 4 o'clock today, for example, and I'll talk to him after work.
赵华明为到上海的旅客进行APP登记个人信息在单位，我是老职工，又是入党积极分子，更经历过非典，我主动向车队提出，请给我加派任务。
Zhao Huaming for the visitors to Shanghai APP registration of personal information in the unit, I am an old worker, is an active party member, more than experienced SARS, I volunteered to the convoy, please give me additional assignments.
节后，我又出乘。
And after the feast I multiplied.
这次临客是重庆到上海。
This visit is from Chongqing to Shanghai.
因为疫情的缘故，旅客不多。
There are not many passengers because of the epidemic.
我们严格执行规章制度，对每一位旅客都做好量体温、APP登记信息等工作。
We strictly carry out the rules and regulations and take temperature and APP registration information for every passenger.
这次我跑完重庆，还要跟车到徐州。
This time I run through Chongqing and follow the bus to Xuzhou.
为了保证家人的安全，特别是保证小孙孙的安全，我租了间房准备自我隔离。
In order to ensure the safety of my family, especially my grandchildren, I rented a room for self-segregation.
房子是网上找的，离自己家附近的地铁一站路的距离，中介费600元，房租每月2000元，都是网上支付的，一下子借了半年。
The house is found online, the distance from their own home near the subway station road, the intermediary fee 600 yuan, rent of 2000 yuan per month, are paid online, all at once borrowed half a year.
因为网上中介的原因，我和中介、房东都没见面。
Because of the online intermediary, I and the intermediary, the landlord did not meet.
房东本人是福建南平人，目前不在上海，自称一时半会也不回上海。
The landlord is a native of Nanping, Fujian Province. He is not in Shanghai at present.
我觉得这也算一种缘分。
I think this is a kind of fate.
1991年我曾在南平当兵，当时准备台海若有事是要上前线的。
In 1991, when I was a soldier in Nanping, I was ready to go to the front if I had anything to do.
现在遇到情况，我想，该冲到第一线还是要往前冲……赵程：新冠肺炎重症患者更需心理护理我接到医院电话征求意见时，老婆就在身边。
Now, I think it's time to rush to the front or to go ahead... Zhao Cheng: New Crown Pneumonia patients need more psychological care I got a call from the hospital asking for advice, my wife was there.
她也是我们瑞金医院北院的护士，我们是夫妻，也是同事。
She is also a nurse in the north courtyard of our Ruijin Hospital. We are husband and wife and co-workers.
一句话说——什么情况，她懂的。
In a word, she understood what it was like.
我妈妈也支持我前去武汉支援，只是希望我在外照顾好自己。
My mother also supported me to Wuhan support, just hope that I take good care of myself outside.
就是家里添丁，我家小宝宝才不到6个月大。
My baby is less than 6 months old.
我爸爸是列车长，妈妈还没退休。
My father is a conductor and my mother is not yet retired.
好在我老婆娘家人同样很支持我去武汉，可以靠他们重点照顾宝宝。
Fortunately, my wife and family also very much support me to Wuhan, can rely on them to focus on baby care.
医院方面也很关心我家。
The hospital is also very concerned about my family.
我老婆现在上常日班。
My wife is on a regular day shift.
赵程在穿防护服前留影我是1月28日出发的。
Zhao Cheng took a picture before wearing protective clothing. I left on January 28th.
到达的武汉第三人民医院光谷院区，本来是个综合医院，现在改造成传染病医院。
Wuhan Third People's Hospital, Guanggu courtyard area, was originally a general hospital, now transformed into a hospital for infectious diseases.
我们这批参加武汉抗疫的，瑞金医院北院有四个护士，两男两女，和其他医院的同事混编工作。
This group of Wuhan anti-epidemic, Ruijin Hospital north hospital has four nurses, two men and two women, and other hospital colleagues mixed work.
比起第一批进武汉的同事当时的情况来，我们目前的排班是工作4小时，休息16小时。
Our current shift is four hours and 16 hours off, as was the case with our first colleagues in Wuhan.
之前那批一开始连续工作时间很长，甚至有穿着纸尿裤上班的。
The previous batch started out working long hours and even wore diapers to work.
我们目前的排班，也是综合考虑了人手，以及穿着隔离服无法吃饭、上厕所等情况。
Our current shift schedule also takes into account the combination of manpower and the inability to eat or use the toilet in isolated clothing.
医生用值班手机拍摄的赵程（右）和他同事，由于穿了防护服相认困难，大家都将自己的名字写在防护服上休班时，我们在医院附近酒店住宿，两个人一间。
Zhao Cheng (right) and his colleagues, photographed by the doctor on duty cell phone, found it difficult to recognize each other in protective clothing. When their names were off duty, we stayed at a hotel near the hospital, one for two.
酒店距离医院步行大约20分钟，不过我们一般都坐班车。
The hotel is about 20 minutes' walk from the hospital, but we usually take a bus.
酒店餐厅24小时供餐。
24-hour meals at the hotel cafeteria.
我们有时候也在餐厅吃饭。
We sometimes eat in a restaurant.
因为餐厅严格消毒，加上人员不多，不必担心在餐厅感染。
Because the restaurant is strictly sanitized and the staff is small, there is no need to worry about infection in the restaurant.
另外，也有外面商家知道我们是援鄂医疗队，给我们发货送吃的。
In addition, there are also outside businessmen know that we are a medical team to Hubei, to deliver food to us.
具体说说工作吧。
Tell me more about the job.
我从学校毕业后，就在瑞金北院的重症监护室工作，遇到过许多危重病人。
After graduating from school, I worked in the intensive care unit of Ruijin North Hospital and met many critically ill people.
他们大多生命垂危，许多人是昏迷状态。
Most of them are in critical condition and many are in a coma.
而在武汉接触到的新冠病毒肺炎重症患者，大多数并不是这样的。
However, most of the severe cases of Newcastle virus pneumonia encountered in Wuhan are not.
他们清醒的多。
They're much more sober.
从护理的角度看，我感觉新冠病毒肺炎重症患者更需要心理护理。
From a nursing point of view, I feel more need of psychological care in patients with severe coronary pneumonia.
他们喘息困难，焦虑。
They are gasping for breath and anxiety.
这些方面，我们尤其要关注，也要总结出护理经验来。
We should pay special attention to these aspects and summarize the nursing experience.
在武汉第三人民医院光谷院区护理病人的赵程17年前非典肆虐。
Zhao Cheng, who cared for patients in the Guanggu courtyard of Wuhan's Third People's Hospital, raged 17 years ago.
那时候，我还在南翔小学读2年级。
At that time, I was still in Nanxiang Primary School in the second grade.
现在记得的事，就是上学时校门口要量体温。
The thing I remember now is to take my temperature at the school gate.
我爸爸那时候跑北京车。
My father was running a Beijing car at that time.
非典的经验如今他用上了。
He now uses the SARS experience.
总的来说，希望大家共同努力，赢得这场非胜不可的抗疫阻击战。
On the whole, I hope you will work together to win the inevitable battle against the plague.
