跳广场舞、练瑜伽、打太极、复习备考……每天我们都能从社交媒体上了解到武汉“方舱医院”内患者们的日常生活。
Jump square dance, yoga, tai chi, review test preparation... Every day we can learn from social media in Wuhan "square cabin hospital" the daily life of patients.
这些看似平常的活动，却为紧张的抗疫工作带来了一丝活力与鼓舞。
These seemingly ordinary activities, but for the intense anti-epidemic work to bring a trace of vitality and inspiration.
2月3日晚，武汉市宣布将在武汉国际会展中心、洪山体育馆、武汉客厅各建一所“方舱医院”，用来收治新冠肺炎患者。
On the evening of February 3, Wuhan city announced that it would build a "square cabin hospital" in Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center, Hongshan Stadium and Wuhan living room to treat patients with Newcastle Pneumonia.
之后，随着确诊患者的增加，在第一批“方舱医院”投入使用后，大大小小的“方舱医院”又相继开建。
Since then, with the increase in the number of confirmed patients, in the first "cabin hospital" after the opening, large and small "square cabin hospitals" have been built.
据悉，目前武汉已全面启用12家方舱医院，全市方舱医院计划床位已超过2万张。
It is reported that at present Wuhan has fully opened 12 square cabin hospitals, the city's plan has more than 20, 000 beds.
何为方舱医院？“方舱”并不是医院的名字，而是一种模块化的野战卫生装备。
What is a square cabin hospital? "square cabin" is not the name of the hospital, but a modular field health equipment.
野战医院大家并不陌生，主要应用于战争时期救治伤员，而“方舱医院”就是由一个个可移动的方舱组成的野战医院。
Field hospitals are no strangers. They are mainly used to treat the wounded in wartime, and "Fang Cao Hospital" is a field hospital composed of movable square cabins.
我们可以把方舱看作一个个乐高积木，有些用来做手术、照X光、灭菌、存放药品和医疗器械等，这些被称作功能方舱。
We can think of the cabins as Lego blocks, some for surgery, X-rays, sterilization, storage of medicines and medical devices, which are called functional cabinets.
还有一些用来为功能方舱供电、供水等，保障它们的正常运作，这些就是技术保障方舱。
Others are used to power functional cabins, supply water, etc., to ensure their normal operation, these are the technical guarantee module.
而将功能方舱与技术保障方舱相连接的就是通道方舱。
It is the channel compartment that connects the functional module to the technical support module.
再加上用来安置伤病员的帐篷以及用来运输的车辆等，就组成了一所完整的“方舱医院”。
This, together with tents for the sick and the wounded and the vehicles used for transportation, made up a complete "cabin hospital."
从方舱医院的组成方式，我们就可以看出，与传统的以帐篷为主的野战医院相比，方舱医院要更加灵活、机动，医疗条件也更加完善，更能适应战时需要。
As can be seen from the way the cabin hospital is organized, it is more flexible, mobile and medically better adapted to wartime needs than the traditional tent-based field hospital.
因此，从20世纪60年代美国率先开始研究和应用医用方舱开始，英、德、法等国也相继展开研究。
Therefore, since the United States began to research and apply the medical module in the 1960s, Britain, Germany, France and other countries have also started to study.
到了90年代，我军也开始了对医用方舱的研究与应用，虽然起步相对较晚，但发展迅速。
In the 1990s, our army also began to study and apply the medical module, although it started relatively late, but it developed rapidly.
第一代方舱医院系统装备还只是基本具备医院诊治功能，病房单元可展开100张床位，昼夜完成75例手术。
The first-generation cabin hospital system is still equipped with only basic hospital functions, ward units can spread out 100 beds, day and night complete 75 operations.
发展到第二代展开床位已达150～200张，昼夜通过伤病员可达300～400人，还增加了远程会诊、核生化防护等功能，设备更加先进、组合也更加灵活，大大提高了救治能力。
By the end of the second generation, the number of beds has grown from 150 to 200, with 300 to 400 patients passing through day and night. Remote consultation, nuclear, chemical and biological protection have also been added.
当然，医用方舱系统的升级换代仍在继续。
Of course, the upgrade of the medical capsule system continues.
第三代方舱医院系统的论证设计在信息化水平、技术保障、人员配置等方面都有显著提升。
The demonstration design of the third-generation cabin hospital system has been improved in the level of information, technical support, staffing and so on.
曾用于地震救援方舱医院虽然起源于战时，但并不仅仅用于军方作战，也会在抢险救灾等紧急救援行动中使用。
Although it originated in wartime, the hospital was not only used in military operations, but also used in emergency rescue operations such as emergency rescue and disaster relief.
在汶川地震、玉树地震救援时，方舱医院就发挥了至关重要的作用。
Wenchuan earthquake, Yushu earthquake relief, the Fang cabin hospital played a crucial role.
抢险救灾，时间就是生命。
Disaster relief, time is life.
方舱医院机动灵活、便于组装的特点在此时就发挥了优势。
Flexible and easy-to-assemble features of the cabin hospital play an important role at this time.
我们以X线方舱为例，它是功能方舱的一种，主要用来诊断患者的病情。
We take the X-ray capsule as an example of a functional capsule that is used to diagnose the patient's condition.
在汶川地震发生后的紧急救援期间，12台方舱以及附属的卫生帐篷从进入场地、展开到连接，再到设备布置、管线安装、最后开始接诊患者，仅用了一个半小时。
During the emergency relief operation following the Wenchuan earthquake, it took only an hour and a half for 12 cabins and associated sanitation tents to reach the site, unfold and connect, then furnish the equipment, install the pipeline and finally begin to treat the patients.
当然，组建得再快，医疗功能跟不上也不行。
Of course, no matter how fast it is organized, health-care functions cannot keep pace.
那么，方舱医院的医疗水平如何呢？所谓麻雀虽小，五脏俱全。
Well, what is the standard of medical care in the Fang Cao Hospital?
别看方舱医院都是临时搭建，但里边的器材非常齐全。
Although the Fangkang Hospital is a temporary structure, but the equipment inside is very complete.
X线方舱布局平面图▼组建完备的方舱医院，其医疗水平更是不容忽视。
= 'class1' > The medical level of the comprehensive plan for the plan of the X-ray module should not be ignored.
据悉，方舱医院展开后就相当于一所二甲医院。
It is reported that after the opening of the cabin hospital equivalent to a second-A hospital.
在青海玉树地震发生后的150多天医疗救助中，方舱医院累计接诊3万余名患者，收治2400余人，完成了1400多例手术。
During the 150-day medical aid period following the Yushu earthquake in Qinghai, the Fang Cao Hospital treated more than 30,000 patients, treated more than 2,400 people and completed more than 1,400 operations.
此次疫情中为何启用方舱医院？对方舱医院有了大致的了解之后，我们再说回此次疫情中武汉建造的几所方舱医院。
After knowing more about the other side of the cabin hospital, we can speak about the hospitals built in Wuhan during the outbreak.
据中国工程院副院长、中国医学科学院院长王辰对媒体记者介绍，这种大规模的“方舱医院”不同于战时或抗震救灾时启用的野战移动类医院。
According to Wang Chen, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the Chinese Academy of Medicine, this large-scale "square cabin hospital" is different from the field mobile hospitals used in wartime or in earthquake relief.
以往没有采用过，是我国公共卫生防控与医疗的一个重大举措。
It has not been used before and is an important measure of public health control and medical treatment in China.
事实上，此次武汉建造的几所“方舱医院”与传统意义上的“方舱医院”略有不同，更多的是运用了方舱医院的内核。
In fact, the Wuhan construction of several "square cabin hospitals" and the traditional sense of the "square cabin hospital" slightly different, more the use of the cabin hospital kernel.
从新闻报道中我们可以看到，目前投入使用或正在建设的方舱医院大多是对已有的体育馆、会展中心等空旷场地较多的公共设施进行改造。
As can be seen from the news reports, most of the square-cabin hospitals currently in use or under construction are public facilities with more open spaces such as existing stadiums, convention and exhibition centers.
武汉体育中心方舱医院▼图片来源：微博@新华视点大家都知道，传染源的隔离对控制疫情发展至关重要，而方舱医院的改造速度很快，最少只需要24小时就可以完成改建，可以在短时间内达到隔离传染源、救治病患的目的。
Why don't you tell us why? Why don't you tell us why? Why don't you tell us why? Why don't you tell us why we're going to tell you why we're going to tell you about it.
另外，不同于传统病房，方舱医院内的病房是开放式的，病患又集中在统一的场地，这更有利于医护人员照看患者、开展工作。
In addition, unlike traditional wards, the wards in the cabin hospital are open and patients are concentrated in a single area, which makes it easier for medical staff to take care of patients and carry out their work.
从方舱医院的病人上传到社交网站上的视频来看，医护人员每天要对病人进行多次测量，记录病人的情况和数据，集中收治让医护人员可以快速、高效地完成这些工作。
Video posted on social networking sites from patients at the cabin hospital shows health-care workers measuring patients multiple times a day, recording patients' profiles and data, and centralizing treatment so that health-care workers can perform these tasks quickly and efficiently.
图片来源：视频截图丨微博@人民网而空旷的场地也让医护人员可以第一时间发现患者的变化，一旦出现病情恶化的现象，能够及时实施救治，或是送往定点医院治疗。
Source: Video screenings into the open spaces of the website also allow health-care professionals to spot changes in patients in the first place and, in the event of a deterioration, to treat them in time or send them to a designated hospital for treatment.
当然，很多人也会担心，病人的集中收治是否会引起交叉感染。
Of course, many people will also worry about whether the concentration of patients will cause cross-infection.
事实上，方舱医院中收治的都是已经确诊的轻症患者，一般情况下不会出现交叉感染的问题。
In fact, the hospital in the square cabin is admitted to patients who have been diagnosed with light illness, generally do not have cross-infection problems.
当然，王辰在接受媒体记者采访时也表示，方舱医院的条件确实不如正规医院完备，但对轻症患者来说基本足够，主要还是解决扩大收治容量、隔离传染源等问题。
Of course, Wang Chen in an interview with the media also said that the conditions of the cabin hospital is not as complete as the regular hospital, but for light patients is basically adequate, mainly to address the expansion of treatment capacity, isolation of the source of infection and other issues.
图片来源：视频截图丨微博@央视新闻他还坦言，在当前状况下，建方舱医院虽非至善之法，但在没有更完善的方法出现的情况下，就是关键时期解决收治矛盾的现实之策。
Source: Video screenings, through video into Twitter @ CCTV News, also confesses that building a cabin hospital, while not the best way to do so in the absence of a better way to do so, is a realistic way to resolve conflicts in the crucial period.
希望如网友所愿，方舱医院可以早日闭院。
