疫情之下的我们。
We are under an epidemic.
拂一个山坡                      。
Feed a hillside.
拂一个山坡。
Feed a hillside.
我们无意关注潮流趋势，也不屈从市场偏好，我们深信“需求是可以被挖掘和创造的”，通过设计高品质产品并且搜罗世界各地鲜为人知的新奇好物，为人们的生活品质带来全方位的提升，更要为他们的生活带来不间断的惊喜！。
We do not want to focus on trends or succumb to market preferences. We are convinced that "needs can be excavated and created." Through the design of high-quality products and the collection of little-known novelties from all over the world, the quality of life of people will be enhanced in all directions, and their lives will be pleasantly surprised!
这题来自Voicer，他们采访了包括我们在内的6位创意行业内不同分支的同侪，分享了这次疫情对他们的影响以及他们相应的思考和应对策略。
Voicer, who interviewed six colleagues in different branches of the creative industry, including us, shared the impact of the epidemic on them and their thinking and coping strategies.
深度专访：疫情之下的创意从业者，你们还好吗？而在这个心情极其复杂的超长春节里，我们继续接棒和更多的设计行业公司以及几个端头聊了聊近期疫情之下的状态与计划。
In-depth interview: Creative workers under the epidemic, how are you? In this extremely complex mood of the Spring Festival, we continue to receive batons and more design industry companies and several end-users to talk about the state and plans under the recent epidemic.
也许未来的生活与事业还将面临一段时间的考验。
Perhaps the future of life and career will face a period of test.
但，一切都要继续。
But all must continue.
接受事实，沉着冷静，积极，无畏，并坚信，无论什么样的选择，都是好的选择。
Accept the facts, calm, positive, fearless, and firmly believe that whatever you choose is a good choice.
立入禁止于2015年重组，由设计取向完全不同的创意人组成，他们从事平面设计、插图、交互界面、出版、策划展览……几乎涵盖了平面设计的所能接触到的方方面面，具有极强的跨域性。
The entry ban was reconstituted in 2015, and is composed of creative people with completely different design orientations, who work in graphic design, illustration, interactive interface, publishing, planning exhibitions... covering almost every aspect of graphic design that is accessible and highly cross-cutting.
尽管工作室已出现工龄15年以上的“老人”，但立入禁止依旧是个极其年轻的团队。
Although the studio has been working for more than 15 years "old people," the ban is still a very young team.
自述：刘治治& 迷盒设计的三个端头：设计师、客户和供应商都受到了影响比较巧合的是我们团队中有几个设计师是湖北籍的，相对幸运的是其中一位设计师原计划回武汉过年临时改道去了湖北的另一座城市宜昌。
Self-report: Liu Zhi-ping; Three Endpoints at Ru's Box Design: Designers, Clients and Vendors are all affected. Coincidentally, several of our designers are Hubei. Fortunately, one of our designers had planned to go back to Wuhan for the Spring Festival holiday and to Yichang, another city in Hubei Province.
而其他成员大都来自天南地北，回北京是一件比较困难的事，就算是突破重重封锁回来了，也需要在家禁闭14天。
Most of the other members are from the north and south of China, and returning to Beijing is a difficult task. Even if you break through the blockade, you will have to spend 14 days at home.
而今年开年我们的项目大多进入品牌维护细节化阶段，有的甚至需要去现场，设计这件事在线上其实并不能充分沟通，我们尝试过远程办公的形式且开过几次视频会议，更多成为了伙伴们的云见面方式。
But this year, most of our projects into the details of brand maintenance phase, some even need to go to the scene, the design of this matter on-line can not fully communicate, we have tried the form of telecommuting and held several videoconferences, more become the partners of the cloud meet.
在工作上其实并没有办法实时反馈，沟通效率比较低，目前主要工作还是由在北京的同事们完成。
In fact, there is no real-time feedback in the work, communication efficiency is relatively low, the main work is still done by colleagues in Beijing.
买手店Pence视觉系统设计其实很多时候不是我们选择什么行业的客户，而是取决于什么行业比较欣欣向荣。
Purchasing a Pence visual system is often not a choice of customers, but depends on which industry is thriving.
巧合的是我们去年设计的很多项目都是来自目前受灾情况最严重的餐饮业，本来在经济持续低迷的年代里我们其实特别看好餐饮业在未来几年的发展，直到这次疫情。
Coincidentally, many of the projects we designed last year came from the worst-hit restaurant industry, and in the midst of a prolonged economic downturn, we were particularly optimistic about the future of the catering industry in the coming years.
在后面我们特地采访了“生死只在一线之间”的一坐一忘。
In the latter we specifically interviewed the "life and death only in a thin line" a sit-down forgotten.
除此之外，我们服务的客户很多都是做人群聚合的项目。
Besides, many of the clients we serve are crowd-aggregation projects.
比如展览、大型活动等，其实会展一直都是发展势头比较好且越来越全球化的行业，直到这次疫情。
For example, exhibitions, large-scale events, in fact, has been a relatively strong and increasingly global industry, until the outbreak.
很多项目都推迟或者是取消了。
Many projects were delayed or cancelled.
今年有一个国际电影节项目，现在出、入境都有问题，电影节本身又是人群聚集的活动，所以仍在观望政策和疫情走向，延期举办已成定局。
This year, there is an international film festival project, now that there are problems with entry and exit, the film festival itself is a crowd event, so is still watching the policy and epidemic trend, the postponement of the organization has become a foregone conclusion.
而今年我们服务的另一个abC艺术书展也确定延期举办了，年前印刷的海报等宣传物料也就此作废。
And this year we serve another abC art book exhibition has also been postponed, the year before printed posters and other promotional materials are also cancelled.
还有跟东京奥运会相关的项目，每天盯着WHO的动向和新闻变成我们的常态，而最新消息是疫情在5月得不到控制就会被取消。
There are also projects related to the Tokyo Olympic Games, where it has become normal to watch WHO movements and news on a daily basis, and the latest news is that the outbreak will be eliminated if unchecked in May.
一些公司也无力在这个时候改变视觉形象。
Some companies are also unable to change their visual image at this time.
比如年前有一个客户，是线上甜品品牌，找到我们想做VI品牌形象的升级。
For example, a year ago there was a customer, is online dessert brand, find us want to do VI brand image upgrade.
节前没时间聊，等最近再联系上的时候客户说自己每月损失近百万，需要进口的原材料进不来，员工工资还得照发，“我们现在考虑的是怎么不花钱，VI往后放”。
There was no time to talk before the festival, and when I contacted you recently, the client said he was losing nearly a million dollars a month, needed to import raw materials to get in, and had to pay staff wages, "We're thinking about how not to spend money, VI back."
供应商也是设计里非常重要的一个环节，设计师仅仅是设计而已，具体实现这些设计还是要依靠供应商。
Supplier is also a very important part of the design, the designer is only the design, the concrete implementation of these designs or to rely on the supplier.
现在印刷厂至少三月才能开工，很多南方的供应商复工遥遥无期，一些小型工厂就此倒闭。
Printing plants will not be operational until at least March, many suppliers from the south are back to work, and some small factories have closed down.
我们本来计划推出的2020年鼠年日历，打样已经完成。
We had planned to launch the Year of the Rat 2020 calendar, the proofing has been completed.
只等树脂材料的进口，但是PHEIC之后，进口原材料变得极为困难，而日历这种载体的时效性决定了这个设计方向的终结，等到供应商复工之后我们会用新的形式来最终完善这个设计。
We waited for the resin material to be imported, but after PHEIC, it became extremely difficult to import raw materials, and the timeliness of the calendar as a vehicle decided the end of the design direction, and when the supplier returned to work we would finalize the design in a new form.
这次灾难炸出了很多人的脆弱我们全天候的互联，但焦虑、担心、沮丧和愤怒的感觉却达到了历史最高的程度，这种焦虑感又与当下环境相互作用，被裹挟在现实矛盾之中持续动荡。
The disaster has blasted the vulnerability of many people - our 24-hour interconnection - but anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger have reached all-time highs, interacting with today's environment and ensnared in constant turbulence in the face of real conflict.
我们团队总共有9个人，不凑巧的是有一位刚回北京来的员工隔壁单元就有一个确诊，他们的小区也进入了特别严格的“战时”管理，返京人员甚至需要自行准备14天的食物，然后大门就此被封上。
There were nine people on our team. Unfortunately, one of the employees who had just returned to Beijing had a diagnosis in the next unit, and their area was under particularly strict "wartime" management. Returnees had to prepare their own food for 14 days and the gates were sealed.
大家都进入了一个疑神疑鬼的阶段，有人查各种感染症状应对自己的身体情况，有人每小时记录自己的体温，有一天甚至焦虑到了37.4度……这是我们每一个人面临的现实，这次灾难炸出了很多人的脆弱，当你的内心世界不平静的时候，其实是无法去做设计相关的事的。
Everyone has entered a paranoid stage, someone checks out all kinds of infection symptoms to deal with their own physical condition, someone keeps track of their body temperature every hour, and one day the anxiety reaches 37.4 degrees... This is a reality for all of us, a disaster that leaves many people vulnerable and unable to do design-related things when your inner world is unstable.
原麦山丘视觉系统设计现在客户更加谨慎，预算至少在上半年不会再像疫情之前一样充裕了。
Raw wheat hill vision systems are now more carefully designed by customers, and budgets will not be as plentiful for at least the first half of the year as they were before the epidemic.
但是长期来看，不觉得设计行业会有一个洗牌。
But in the long run, I don't think there's going to be a shuffle.
因为设计行业有它的特殊性，平面设计工作室主要还是看主创人员的设计逻辑与能力。
Because the design industry has its particularity, the graphic design studio mainly depends on the design logic and ability of the creator.
在一段时间的沉寂之后，序列还是会保持的，只是可能服务的行业会有变化。
After a period of silence, the sequence will remain, but the industries that may be served will change.
好的一方面是我们留给自己的设计思考时间更多了，今年也许有很多项目会花更长的时间来打磨。
The good part is that we've left ourselves more time to think about our designs, and there may be many that will take longer to polish this year.
比如电影节原计划其实在2月初就需要提案，延期举办也让我们有更多的时间来思考究竟什么样的视觉语言才能在权力审美与普通民众之间达到平衡，以及怎样才能扭转以往电影节在大众传播中的视觉负面影响。
For example, the film festival originally planned to need proposals in early February, the postponement of the event also gives us more time to think about what kind of visual language can strike a balance between the aesthetic of power and the general public, and how to reverse the negative visual effects of previous film festivals in mass communication.
疫情之后我们还是会更多地发出自己的声音，梳理一下以往的作品。
After the outbreak, we will still more voice, comb the past works.
我们可能不会考虑改变业务的范围，但是我们会更多的思考“设计”本身以及一切收束于“人”。
We may not consider changing the scope of our business, but we will think more about "design" itself and all about "people."
治世之能臣，乱世之饭桶平面设计是一件锦上添花的事，疫情之下做设计，的确显得有些百无一用。
The world's powerful minister, chaotic rice barrel graphic design is a icing on the cake, the epidemic under the design, do seem to be a little foolproof.
设计师是“治世之能臣，乱世之饭桶”。
Designer is "the minister of the world, the mess of the bucket."
治世的时候，设计师的任务是保证这个世界有趣，有多样性；但情况反过来的话，谈多样性多少显得有些不合时宜。
At the time of governance, the designer's task was to ensure that the world was interesting and diverse; but, conversely, it seemed somewhat out of place to talk about diversity.
在相对繁荣的社会里，人们对审美和精神的需求大，我们的工作才有效。
In a relatively prosperous society, our work is effective only if there is a great need for beauty and spirituality.
一旦我们转换成一个刚需社会，在人们忙于满足马斯洛需求里最底层的那些需求的时候，审美、精神、美学、生活方式会不会持续走低，这个低潮会持续多久，而这种例外状态会不会变成常态，会不会就此入侵我们以后的日常生活，这是一个让我们不仅仅是作为设计师身份在焦虑的问题。
Once we are transformed into a starving society, will aesthetics, spirituality, aesthetics, and lifestyle continue to decline as people struggle to meet the needs of those at the bottom of Maslow's needs, and will this state of exception become the norm and invade our daily lives, a question that makes us anxious not just as designers.
《开放之城——清明上河图香港展》视觉系统设计记住苦难比打气加油重要疫情发生之后，做什么事情之前都会想：意义是什么。
Open City - The Hong Kong Exhibition on the Qingming River. Visual System Design Remember that suffering is more important than cheering up after a major outbreak.
现在的我们无法做无关痛痒的事情。
Now we can not do innocuous things.
设计师最大的力量是在疫情过去之后帮助人们葆有对这段时间苦难的记忆，而不是吆喝口号式地加油打气。
The greatest strength of designers is to help people maintain memories of this period of suffering after the epidemic, rather than yelling for encouragement.
我们也接到了疫情打气海报设计的委托，虽然那句“奥斯维辛之后诗歌是可耻的”被某只错误挪用反自黑，但在瘟疫之中的海报设计是很荒诞的，不说它比不上救助信息整理的infographic设计，甚至抵不上一次随手捐转发，它无论从美学上还是从功能上都是失败的。
We were also entrusted with the design of an epidemic of gas-boosting posters, which, although the phrase "Poetry after Auschwitz is shameful" was misappropriated by some misguided anti-self-image, the poster design in the plague was grotesque, not to say inferior to the infographic design of the rescue message, or even a handpicked forwarding, which was both aesthetic and functional.
云下餐厅视觉系统设计瘟疫过后，人们会留下几种记忆？非典过去17年了，人们还记得谁是蒋彦永？“没有记性的人，从本质上说就是土。
How many memories do people have after the plague of designing a vision system for restaurants under the clouds? For the past 17 years of SARS, people still remember who Robin Jiang was? People who don't remember sex are essentially soil.
鞋愿意把我们踩成什么样，由那只鞋说了算。
It's up to the shoe to decide what kind of shoes we're going to step on.
”没有人在每年三、四月的时候纪念非典，电影人没有拍很多相关的纪录片，因为艺术家也是健忘者之一。
No one celebrates SARS in March or April each year, and filmmakers don't make many documentaries because artists are also forgetful.
记住苦难是比打气加油重要得多的，为什么非典之后又重蹈覆辙，就是因为大家没有在事件过后好好梳理。
Remember that suffering is much more important than cheering up. Why did SARS happen again after SARS was because we didn't clean it up after the event?

OPEN OBJECT是一个诞生于2017年的中国陶瓷设计品牌，通过融合现代主义风格与现有陶瓷材料技艺，重新诠释“中国陶瓷”这个既有概念。
OPEN OBJECT is a Chinese ceramic design brand born in 2017 that reinterprets the established concept of "Chinese ceramics" by blending modernism with existing ceramic art.
OPEN OBJECT下设两条品牌线：LAB和MASS。
OPEN OBJECT has two brands: LAB and MASS.
LAB线与陶艺家、艺术家合作，仅生产限量品，用精湛的工艺来实现凝练的外观，超越普通商品的形态。

MASS line to mass-produced products, using design to give ceramic products performance and aesthetic balance.
自述：董谧情绪是跌宕起伏的意识到疫情的严重性比较晚，几乎是22号要停工回家过年的时候，才从大面积报道中意识到事情扩大的速度超过了人们的预期。
Self-talk: Dongmei mood is to realize the severity of the epidemic is relatively late, almost 22 to stop work to celebrate the New Year, only to learn from widespread reports that things have expanded faster than people expected.
当时非常不确定事情的走向，我内心还是有恐惧的，所以下意识地在回家之前，把所有的N95口罩都打包带在身上，然后又下单了40个寄到父母家里。
Unsure of what was going on, I was still frightened, so I unconsciously wrapped all the N95 masks around my body before I went home and ordered another 40 to my parents' house.
假日的时间，早上会做简单的运动，然后看书或者写毛笔字，花很长时间做午饭，下午会用来看电影或者剧（一连看了8部侯麦，然后看了跟时局有些话题相关的《新闻编辑室》）。
During the holidays, we do some simple exercise in the morning, then read or write in calligraphy, spend a lot of time making lunch, and watch movies or plays in the afternoon (read eight Hou Mai in a row, and then read the newsroom, which is related to some topics of the day).
以前很少在家整天整天呆着，没有掌握规律，但现在学会了跟着家里的阳光行进路线在卧室和客厅之间移动。
Seldom used to stay at home all day long without mastering the rules, but now learn to follow the sun's path through the house and move between the bedroom and the living room.
OPEN OBJECT 在上海买手店in the PARK的展览关于疫情肯定是关注进展，追看一些分析文章，了解它的来源、感染过程、症状等；其次是追看武汉那边的医疗部门的信息更新，了解他们是否有能力处理大量病患；另外了解了一下社会上的捐助渠道，并且力所能及地提供一些支持；最后其实是这几个层面的反复follow-up，事情的进展每天不同，会出现新的问题、新的解决方案。
After reading some analytical articles to find out the source of the disease, the infection process, the symptoms and so on. Secondly, we can find out whether the medical department in Wuhan has the ability to deal with the large number of patients.
此次疫情我主要是从网络渠道获取信息，我个人也经历了好几个波段的情绪起伏，不断在失望&希望、恐惧&有信心之间摆荡。
I learned about the epidemic mainly from online sources, and I personally experienced several waves of disappointment, hope, fear, and confidence at & amp; # 39; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45; & # 45;
事件之初的态度可能和大多数人一样，让自己浸淫在信息的洪流当中，任凭负面情绪占据主导。
The attitude at the beginning of an event may be the same as that of most people, immersing themselves in a deluge of information and allowing negative emotions to dominate.
一定程度上这种——“知道武汉及湖北省都在遭受遭难，如果我自己安然度日，太不人道了”——的心理占据了潜意识，所以可能也潜意识地选择阅读更多的负面信息。
To some extent, this - "knowing that Wuhan and Hubei provinces are suffering, if I live comfortably and inhumanely" - preoccupies the subconscious, so I may subconsciously choose to read more negative information.
但是一段时间以后，发现自己的情绪难以承受，于是自保机制启动，每天有控制地获取信息。
But after a while, finding that their emotions were unbearable, self-insurance mechanisms were activated and controlled access to information was provided on a daily basis.
同时会跟很多朋友不断讨论这些内容，交换各自的看法——不同的人有不同的角度，这个事实很有趣，为我提供了新的观看疫情发展的视角。
It's also interesting to talk about this with a lot of friends and exchange ideas - the fact that different people have different perspectives - gives me a new perspective on how the epidemic is unfolding.
即便是与我志同道合、年龄社会阅历相仿的朋友，也可能与我产生南辕北辙的看法，说明每一个人获取信息的渠道的差异可能很大，另外每个人对信息选择与加工的机制大相径庭，人们对于真相的追求其实是很困难的，复杂的信息渠道和表述方式，最终有可能使得大家仍然笃信自己早已认定的事情。
Even like-minded friends of my own age and social experience may have the opposite view, suggesting that everyone's access to information can vary widely, that the mechanisms for information selection and processing vary widely, that the pursuit of truth is difficult, and that complex information channels and representations may ultimately lead to people remaining committed to what they already believe.
承认事情的复杂性，并且不带有太大的野心，保持冷静退一步观察——这是我对自己提出的一个建议。
Acknowledge the complexity of the matter, and don't be too ambitious, stay calm and take a step back - this is one of my own suggestions.
疫情反而让工作安排更为妥帖远程复工之后，上班的时间与往常一致，通勤的时间被挪用为做午饭的时间。
Instead, the epidemic has led to a better work schedule, with regular working hours and commuting time diverted to lunch.
一开始在家办公有些焦虑，由于见不到同事，感觉对于项目进程失去控制。
Working from home was a bit stressful at first, and I felt out of control of the project process because I didn't see my co-workers.
但是到目前为止，我们已经差不多复工3周，逐渐对远程办公感到习惯，也发现其优势，在于相比很多当面的沟通，输入文字的过程会让我抽离主体，以旁观者的角度来沟通，反而有时候看事情更清楚。
But we've been back to work for almost three weeks now, and we're getting used to telecommuting, and we've found the advantage of it being that, compared to a lot of face-to-face communication, the process of typing allows me to pull away from the subject, communicate from the perspective of an onlooker, and sometimes see things better.
工作方面一是了解国家政策是否有出台向中小企业倾斜的政策规定；然后是各地返工时间的规定；再是返工隔离时间的规定等；另外就是国家经济的受损程度，以及对于如何逐步恢复的预测。
The first aspect of the work is to know whether there are policy provisions in the State policy in favour of SMEs; then there are provisions for local rework schedules; then there are provisions for re-work isolation periods; and the extent of damage to the national economy, as well as projections of gradual recovery.
OPEN OBJECT“半”系列月白碗我们工作室2月3日便复工了。
OPEN OBJECT "Half Moon Bowl" series Our studio resumed work on February 3.
一开始就做好了复工的心理准备，要求员工尽可能在家创造一个可以安心工作的物理环境。
Get ready to get back to work at the beginning, and ask employees to create a physical environment at home where they can feel at home.
开工第一天我们简单做了一个Pep talk, 把员工带入我们的Big picture中, 鼓励大家有信心地迎接接下来的无论什么状况。
We did a simple Pep talk on the first day of work, bringing people into our Big Picture and encouraging them to be confident about whatever comes next.
幸运的是，除了远程工作的新模式以外，没有太大的影响。
Fortunately, apart from the new model of telecommuting, there is not much impact.
有一些时效性比较强的项目，因为疫情的关系取消了。
Some of the more time-sensitive projects, because the outbreak of the relationship has been cancelled.
但工作室总体的项目量没有太大的变化。
But the studio's overall project volume hasn't changed much.
我们再次梳理了自己的工作范畴，力图去芜存菁——但这事实上这也是我们不断在做的事情，并非是疫情催生的事件。
Once again, we have sorted out our work, trying to turn things around -- but that's what we keep doing, not what the epidemic is all about.
关于疫情公司层面的调整，更多是在心理上与观念上的调整。
Regarding the epidemic situation company level adjustment, is in the psychology and the idea adjustment more.
也可以点击这个链接🔗Ways ofSeeing文中详述。
You can also click this link to turn to Ways of Seeing for details.
对于设计公司，如同疫情中的所有人，我们的客户也会面临不同程度的资金压力，这使得他们做决策与调整时，在收支维度上更用心权衡。
For design companies, like everyone else in the epidemic, our customers face varying degrees of financial stress, which makes them weigh the balance of payments more carefully when making decisions and adjustments.
但花费最少的预算达到最大化的效果一直是我们的工作理念之一，所以对我们而言，双方目标是一致的。
But maximizing the impact of the least expensive budget has always been one of our working ideas, so for us, the two sides share the same goals.
OPEN OBJECT“线”系列花器对于品牌，上游供应链因为疫情影响把生产计划稍稍推后了，但对我们影响不大。
OPEN OBJECT "LINE" series of floriculturists for brands, upstream supply chain due to the impact of the epidemic caused a slight delay in production plans, but we have little impact.
而针对下游销售渠道，因为我们一直在布局线下结合线上、B端结合C端，工作量是非常大的，这一段时间我们正好用来梳理品牌运营的诸多细节、敲定合作，争取从三月开始把正常的经营活动带回正轨。
And for the downstream distribution channels, because we have been in the layout line, B end combined with C end, the workload is very large, we are just used to comb the details of brand operations, finalize cooperation, from March on to bring normal business back on track.
原定OPEN OBJECT会在上半年到年中有一些小型的独立展览，依据现在的节奏也会相应推后。
The original OPEN OBJECT will have small stand-alone exhibitions from the first half to the middle of the year, and the pace will be adjusted accordingly.
XU ZHI展览是一个反思的好时机实话说，作为设计师我自己的专业不能在疫情中发挥太大作用。
The XU ZHI exhibition is a good time for reflection. To be honest, my own profession as a designer cannot play much of a role in the epidemic.
我觉得各行各业能够做的是从更宏观的层面反思自己之前的商业逻辑是否是正确的，是否在一元价值体系下不断向前狂奔而来不及思考。
What I think all industries can do is to reflect on a broader level whether their previous business logic is correct and whether they are rushing forward without thinking in a monist value system.
既然2020年第一季度的经济状况注定会比较糟糕，那么大家能做好的就是努力完成本职工作，为已经失去的时间做一些补救。
Now that economic conditions in the first quarter of 2020 are bound to be worse, all you can do is work hard to get the job done and make up for lost time.
OPEN OBJECT 在上海买手店in the PARK的展览我相信很多人都会有有意识或者被迫停下来审视自己的工作，在此期间，我们觉得跟我们的客户沟通更深入、理解更多了。
OPEN OBJECT Buy a Hand Shop in the PARK Exhibition in Shanghai I'm sure many people will have the sense or the compulsion to take a look at their jobs, during which time we feel more connected and understood with our customers.
大家会在更深入的层面上交换意见，在商业模式和经营理念上有更丰富、更坦诚的沟通，有一种紧密合作的感受——这是我之前没有遭遇过的，两个商业个体一定程度上具有了“人性”的个人属性，彼此理解彼此信任，这种感觉蛮好的，我想我们在之后与客户的合作当中，会想要继续保有这种“人性”的一面。
There will be a more in-depth exchange of views, richer and more candid communication on business models and concepts, and a sense of close co-operation - something I've never encountered before. It's good that two business individuals have some personal attributes of "humanity" and understand each other's trust.
疫情结束后物理条件上应该不会有太大的变化，出于效率考量，我们不会变成远程办公。
Physical conditions should not change much after the outbreak. We won't be telecommuting for reasons of efficiency.
但是疫情之后，大家都是“经历过事儿”的人了，肯定都有一些心理上的成长，会有更多元的角度来思考和解决问题，更习惯多问一句“为什么”，更试图去抓住事情的本质，这是我希望看到的局面。
But after the epidemic, we are all "experienced" people, there must be some psychological growth, there will be more multi-angle thinking and problem-solving, more used to ask the "why," more trying to grasp the essence of things, this is the situation I would like to see.
消化设计工作间，2010年成立于北京，“消”为成衣，“化”为概念。
Digestive Design Workshop, founded in Beijing in 2010, "eliminate" for garments, the concept of "transformation."
“消化”始终以接近学术研究的方式实践设计——从最初热衷的概念化、着重视觉官能的设计，到研习手工织物与民间服饰、梳理传统和当下的关系，最后回归生活本体。
Digestion has always practiced design in a way that is close to academic research - from the initial passion for conceptualizing, focusing on visual design, to studying handmade fabrics and folkloric costumes, sorting out the relationship between tradition and the present, and finally returning to life itself.
“消化” 相信，传统与先锋不是对立的两面。
Digestion believes that tradition and pioneers are not two sides of the same coin.
理解并尊重事物的本源，做恰如其分的衣服，是“消化”秉持的创作方向。
Understanding and respecting the origin of things, and doing the right clothes, is the "digestion" adhere to the creative direction.
网址：www.digest-design.com消化三里：www.digest3kg.com自述：Dooling“不让李文亮死”这件事之后，我觉得自己被解放了最初得到消息，大概是1月20号那天吧，北京报有人确诊，然后我家人在国外，告诉我留意这次流感。
Website: www.digest3kg.com Digest Three Mile: www.digest3kg.com: Dooling "Don't Let Liang Die," I felt liberated. First I got word that it was January 20th.
真正意识到严重，是23号半夜，从武汉朋友那里知道封城了。
Really aware of the seriousness, is 23 midnight, from Wuhan friends know the closure of the city.
这个至少在现代吧，没有过先例。
Well, at least in modern times, there's no precedent.
“DIGEST UNI- 2020” RUNWAY从1月23号到李文亮去世后几天，2月10号吧，这段时间我每天差不多看十几个小时的新闻，加上归拾家里十年没动的书籍资料等等（这是这次假期原本的计划），平均每天睡3-5个钟头，有点儿透支，但停不下来。
"DIGEST UNI-2020" RUNWAY from January 23 to a few days after Li Wenliang's death, February 10, when I read almost a dozen hours of news every day, plus 10 years' worth of untouched books and so on (as originally planned for this holiday) and slept an average of three to five hours a day, a bit overdrawn but unable to stop.
一定程度上，我是一个“新闻动物”，平时每天也都要看几篇过万字的报道和文章。
To a certain extent, I am a "news animal", usually every day to read a few million words of the report and articles.
因为我希望自己面对的是一个“清澈”的世界，至少在我目力所及的部分，是这样的。
Because I want to face a "clear" world, at least as far as I can see, is this.
第一个”化”系列：《光蚀 LIGHT LOST》在疫情期间几乎关注的都是和疫情相关的。
The first series: "Light Erosion LIGHT LOST" during the epidemic almost all the attention is related to the epidemic.
所有大家看过的新闻，我应该都看过了。
I should have read all the news you've read.
觉得每天不赶紧醒来看新闻，就要被它们吞食了。
If you don't wake up and watch the news every day, you'll be devoured by them.
就像是一个巨大的无形的怪物，始终蹲守在你身边。
Just like a huge invisible monster, always squatting next to you.
你不消化它，它就把你消化了。
If you don't digest it, it will digest you.
我相信很多人也有类似的感受，尤其是共情感强烈的人。
I believe a lot of people have similar feelings, especially those with strong empathy.
“不让李文亮死”这件事之后，我觉得自己被解放了。
After not letting Li Wenliang die, I felt liberated.
因为你看到了那条底线，已经低到了你不需要再通过事件去观察它的位置了，没有必要了，而且这是一个长久积累下来的东西，积劳成疾，是个病，它得发出来。
Because you see the bottom line, it's so low that you don't have to look at it through events, it's unnecessary, and it's a thing that's been built up for a long time.
我能做的就是抱着最大的善意，等待它的自愈或就此消亡。
All I can do is wait for it to heal or die with the best of intentions.
然后会有一个新的循环开始，就像冬天结束，春天一定会来那样的。
Then there will be a new cycle beginning, just like the end of winter, spring will come like that.
我始终相信周而复始，历史从来都不是以线性前进的。
I have always believed that history never moves in a linear fashion.
在2014年，荷兰博伊曼斯美术馆展出的最后一季“化”系列：《我们的家园 OUR HOME》到底是什么驱使了我们维持“生活”这件事我们已经局部复工一周了。
In 2014, the final season of the series "Chemistry" at the Boymans Gallery in the Netherlands: "Our Home, OUR HOME," drove us to keep "life" alive. We've been working part-time for a week.
但其实加上我就两个人。
But I'm just two people.
其他人都不在北京，或者刚回来就赶上了要求隔离14天。
None of the others were in Beijing, or had just returned to meet a 14-day quarantine requirement.
我们没有做什么特别的准备，服装设计不是基于事务，而是制造。
We don't make any special preparations. Fashion design is not based on business, but manufacturing.
工作室本身就是一个微缩工厂，少了任何一个工种，都没法展开工作。
The studio itself is a miniaturized factory, without any kind of work, it is unable to work.
我们唯一能做的，就是等各岗位的人就位。
The only thing we can do is wait until the people are in position.
艺术合作系列“UNI-O 2020”对于消化设计工作室来说，因为时装周和订货会推迟（或取消），我们可以做的就是做好订货资料的准备。
The Art Collaboration Series UNI-O 2020 is for digestive design studios, as fashion weeks and orders can be delayed (or cancelled), all we can do is prepare the order information.
我们相对幸运的是，因为去年刚开启“消化三里”这家商店，我们全年只做了一个系列，并且已经在2020年1月9号做完了发布，所以不像其他设计师品牌，面临着2020年秋冬系列无法良好的完成并发布。
We're relatively lucky that, with just three miles of digestion opened last year, we've only been doing one series all year, and it was released on January 9, 2020, so unlike other designer brands, we're facing the fall and winter 2020 series that we can't do well.
各环节人员不到位、面辅料调配不齐、物流受阻等等，这对讲求时效、跟循季节的时尚行业，是无法跨越的困难。
Each link personnel does not arrive, the flour auxiliary material allocation uneven, the logistics obstruction and so on, this stresses the time-sensitive, follows the seasonal fashion industry, is unable to surmount the difficulty.
只能等待。
Only wait.
DIGEST UNI- 2020但另一个棘手的事是，我们必须在3月下旬完成一个全新的胶囊系列，这个是年前谈定的，和一个服装上市公司。
DIGEST UNI-2020 But the other tricky thing is that we have to finish a whole new capsule line in late March, negotiated a year ago, and a clothing-listed company.
虽然疫情算是不可抗力，但这本应是工作室一次很好的锻炼机会，进入一个更宽广的市场，被一个更庞大的系统测试。
Although the outbreak was a force majeure, it should have been a great opportunity for the studio to get into a broader market and be tested by a larger system.
至少我作为设计师和工作室创办人，是想好好的完成这次“测试”，而不是作为一个项目，搪塞了之。
At least as a designer and studio creator, I wanted to do this "test" well, not as a project, prevaricate.
当然，这也迫使我重新思考，人们，包括我自己在内，到底是什么驱使了我们维持“生活”这件事。
Of course, it also forces me to rethink what drives us, including myself, to keep our lives alive.
消费？还是被消费？是稀里糊涂的得过且过，还是心知肚明的被收割？还是，有第三条路？我用自己的技能，能为此做点儿什么？还是，无论做什么，结果已经在远处立着了，都是一样的？服装设计师完全无法在疫情中发挥作用面对疫情我们没有特殊的调整。
Consumption? Or is it a muddle-headed muddle through, or is there a third way? What can I do with my skills? Or is it the same, no matter what I do, standing in the distance? Clothing designers can't play a role in the epidemic.
我们体量非常的小，无足轻重。
We are very small and insignificant.
我更关心的是其它更直接的关乎民生民计的行业，他们将做出，或者能做出什么样的调整。
I am more concerned with other, more directly related, sectors of the population that will make, or can make, adjustments.
作为服装设计师，我认为服装设计师完全无法在疫情中发挥作用，我已经多次在朋友圈提到服装/时装设计师的无能。
As a fashion designer, I don't think the fashion designer has a role to play in the epidemic, and I have repeatedly spoken to friends about the incompetence of clothing / fashion designers.
艺术合作系列“UNI-O 2020”如果非要给自己找拨些作用，大概就是精神和文化方面的了。
The art collaboration series UNI-O 2020 is probably spiritual and cultural if it has to do something about itself.
上个月月底，转了一篇文章，写A.P.C.的，品牌创始人Jean Touitou接受访问说，“我会把衣服给老师和护士，而不是明星们。

”独立商店“消化三里DIGEST 3kg”开幕活动邀请函，由设计师广煜设计真正的时装或时尚，是非常犀利的，它是提炼式的，接近诗歌和政治。
The Invitation Letter for the Inaugural Activities of the Independent Store "Digest Three Mile DIGEST 3kg," designed by designer Michael Guangyu to design real fashion or fashion, is very sharp, it is refined, close to poetry and politics.
它和一篇时评或社论，没有本质区别。
It is not fundamentally different from a time review or an editorial.
不能洞悉生活的本质，是无法做好时尚的。
You can't be stylish without insight into the nature of life.
因为时尚只关注当下，只呈现一种瞬间，但却令活在那个当下的人群无法不注目和跟随。
For fashion is concerned only with the present, and presents only one moment, but it keeps those who live in that moment invisible and unobtrusive.
这需要具备一定的底层逻辑思考力，而这种思考力，来自文化的积淀。
This requires a certain level of logical thinking, and this thinking power, from the accumulation of culture.
所以我们几乎不谈论美国加拿大澳大利亚这类新起国家的时尚，因为太落后了，从来就没赶上时尚的趟儿，至多说说商业的运作，或者沃尔玛吧。
So we hardly talk about the fashions of new countries like America, Canada, and Australia, because they are so outdated that they never catch up with the fashions, or at least the workings of business, or Wal-Mart.
独立商店“消化三里DIGEST 3kg”由设计师广煜设计的视觉系统这次疫情让我在状态上更果决了吧，因为有更重要的事等着我去做。
The independent store "digestion three li DIGEST 3kg" by the designer Yuyu's visual system design this outbreak let me more decisive in the state, because I have more important things to do.
技能上，对事物核心的挖掘能力增强了。

我是天秤座，大多数时候都在做平衡，是一种本能，也有乐趣，但其实很多是没有必要的。
I'm a Libra and I balance most of the time. It's instinctive and fun, but a lot of it is unnecessary.
孙海霆，北京垣冶建筑规划设计有限公司创始合伙人，文物保护工程责任设计师自述：孙海霆疫情让整个社会急刹车我1月20号左右意识到疫情的严重性，当时就觉得2020年上半年可能会受影响，过年期间在日本，2月4号回北京以后就一直在家里。
Sun Hsing, founder partner of Beijing Yuanye Construction Planning and Design Co., Ltd., the architect in charge of the conservation project, said: Sun Tingting made the whole society brake. I realized the severity of the epidemic around January 20 and felt that the first half of 2020 might be affected.
每天很规律，自己做三餐，坚持锻炼和工作，和平时比反而节省了上下班在路上堵车的时间，突然觉得在家办公也挺好。
Every day is very regular, oneself cook three meals, adhere to exercise and work, and compared to normal time to save time on the road traffic jam, suddenly feel good working from home.
当然对我来说，首要还是如何保证家人和自身的健康，以及采取什么样的方式使公司在疫情期间继续维持正常运转。
The first priority for me, of course, is to ensure the health of my family and myself, and how to keep the company going during the epidemic.
类型学摄影之”城中村“系列 by 孙海霆今年冬天开始的新的摄影项目也因为不方便外出暂停了，因为这个项目的最佳拍摄时间是冬天，街上没有太多树叶，估计要明年冬天才能拍完了。
Typology photo series by Sun Ting The new photo project, which started this winter, has also been put on hold because the project's best shot is in the winter, when there aren't many leaves on the street and it's not expected to be finished until next winter.
我觉得国家或者社会，其实和一个人的个体是一样的，生一次病当然痛苦，但也能检验一下自身的免疫系统，给自己的健康提个醒，亡羊补牢。
I think the country or society, in fact, is the same as a person's individual, giving birth to a disease is certainly painful, but can also test their own immune system, to their own health, to make up for.
这段时间国内因为疫情强行刹车，其实也有好处，让大家都停下来好好想想以后怎么走，生活该怎么过。
This period of time because of the epidemic forced brakes, in fact, there are benefits, so that everyone stopped to think about how to go, how to live life.
深濑昌久的《鸦》我觉得特别能反映生机和死亡混杂在一起的状态，带着压抑的状态要保持平稳的节奏我们是2月3号开始公司远程协同办公的，至今已经快三周了。
Deep Setoyama's Crows I think it is especially revealing of the way in which life and death mix together to maintain a steady rhythm. It has been almost three weeks since we started telecommuting on February 3.
开工前制定了公司远程办公手册，建立了工作平台，每两周制定一次详细的工作计划。
A company telecommuting manual was developed prior to construction, a working platform was established and a detailed work plan was developed every two weeks.
目前看运行还不错，效率和集中办公比并没有明显的降低。
At present, it seems to be running well, efficiency and the ratio of centralized office is not significantly reduced.
公司所有人包括我，目前都在各自家中，先保证集体安全，暂时没有集中办公的打算。
Company owners, including me, are currently in their respective homes, to ensure collective security, there is no intention of centralizing office.
类型学摄影之“人工自然”系列 by 孙海霆我们和大部分建筑师事务所还是有一定差别，我们专门做文化遗产保护的项目，项目比较稳定，周期也相对长，刚好年前陆续签了几个较大的项目，开春本来是要打算加班加点干到三月份的，疫情反倒给我们稍缓了一口气，可以维持一个正常的工作休息节奏，但由于国家文物局每年三月是一个申报立项的窗口期，所以我们仍然有些项目比较着急。
We specialize in heritage conservation projects, where the project is relatively stable and the cycle is relatively long. Even though the first few major projects were signed up in the spring to work overtime until March, the outbreak has given us some relief to maintain a normal working day.
我们和业主（基本都是地方政府文物主管部门）也一直保持沟通，一些新的项目也在洽谈，总体来说对公司影响不是太大。
We have also been in communication with our owners, who are mostly local government heritage authorities, and some new projects are being negotiated, which in general will have little impact on the company.
未来公司的发展方向也没有根据疫情调整，我们还是会专注在遗产保护相关的工程设计领域。
The future direction of the company has not been adjusted according to the epidemic, we will still focus on heritage conservation-related engineering design.
我了解其他同行基本也都是网上远程工作，下周开始陆续有集中复工的，疫情主要是对项目的进度造成了停滞，新项目也很难接到，但工资社保还要发，对一些储备不足的小事务所还是有影响的。
I understand that most of my peers are also telecommuting on the Internet. Starting next week, the focus will be on projects that have stalled and new projects are hard to come by, but wages and social security will have an impact on smaller firms with insufficient reserves.
“西部乐园”系列 by 孙海霆建筑学的影响相对微弱建筑学短期最直接的作用首先是在医疗建筑方向吧。
"Western Paradise" series by Sun Ting Architecture the impact of the relatively weak short-term most direct effect of architecture is in the direction of medical construction.
从长远来看，在城市设计层面上可能更值得探索思考。
In the long run, it may be worth exploring at the level of urban design.
但我觉得比起医疗、通讯、物流这些领域，建筑学的影响还是明显微弱和滞后的。
But I think architecture is still noticeably weak and lagged behind in areas like health care, communications, and logistics.
正在建设中的建筑项目我觉得这次疫情中在极限时间内要建出一个传染病医院，在一套小汤山医院现成的图纸上适当修改基本上是唯一的选择了，这就是一个极限应急案例，不能纳入到正常的建筑设计讨论范畴，承担这次项目图纸设计的建筑师团队已经代表行业能力的极限了，我非常钦佩，我自己是想不出更好的解决方案的。
Construction Projects Under Construction I feel that in this epidemic we need to build an infectious disease hospital within the limit of time. The only option is to modify the existing drawing of Xiaotangshan Hospital. This is an extreme contingency case that cannot be included in the normal architectural discussion.
如果说有什么更好的方法和策略，我想也许能设立一个课题，提前设计并预制好应对重大公共安全事件的医疗模块，包含必要的设备和管线，再有类似情况就可以像集装箱一样直接运过去就地组装吧。
If there were any better methods and strategies, I think it might be possible to set up a project to design and pre-fabricate medical modules for major public security incidents, including the necessary equipment and pipelines, and similar cases could be shipped as containers directly to local assembly.
疫情期间我有更多的时间在家看书和查阅资料，这对于我目前的工作很有帮助。
During the epidemic, I have more time to read and consult materials at home, which is very helpful for my present job.
我觉得通过这段时间的远程办公探索了一套更灵活的工作方式，结束后我们会在长时间的出差、调研过程中继续使用。
I think we have explored a more flexible way of working through this period of telecommuting, after which we will continue to use it for long periods of business trips and research.

'Every crisis is an opportunity to change the pattern of the market, 'he said.' The food and beverage industry is bound to see a major reshuffle as a result of this epidemic.
如何挺过眼前的劫难？疫情之后，一坐一忘到底要放弃什么和坚持什么，如何拉开和竞争对手的差异化，如何构建品牌认知优势？如何从危机与变化中找到方向？感觉自己从来也没有这么严肃的思考过这些问题，不能这么不堪一击，要构筑自己的护城河。
How to survive the immediate disaster? After the epidemic, sit back and forget what to give up and what to insist on, how to open up the difference with competitors, how to build brand cognitive advantages, how to find a way out of the crisis and change, how to think about these issues so seriously, not so vulnerable, to build their own moat.
