澎湃新闻记者 喻琰一张黑底海报，画中央是一位老人，标题是，寻找“无法取菜的”独居老人。
David Yu, a journalist with a black-bottomed poster with an elderly man in the center, is looking for "unreachable" lone elderly people.
武汉封闭社区以来，买菜做饭成了许多独居老人面临的难题。
Since Wuhan closed community, shopping and cooking has become a difficult problem for many elderly people living alone.
他们不会用手机团购，儿女也不在身边。
They don't buy it by cell phone, and their kids aren't around.
26岁的武汉人小鱼（化名）和志愿者在社交媒体上发起“寻找武汉市内无法取菜的独居老人”活动，贴出上述海报。
The 26-year-old Wuhan native fish (not his real name) and volunteers posted the poster on social media as part of a campaign to "find lonely old people in Wuhan who can't get food."
3月5日，小鱼告诉澎湃新闻，活动发起后至3月5 日凌晨，他们的微信上一共通过了1434位好友申请，除去无效信息，大概有四分之三属于老人或家属求助。
Fish told the roar news on March 5 that by the early morning of March 5, 1,434 applications had been approved in their letters, and about three-quarters of them were old people or family members seeking help.
对于符合帮扶标准的，小鱼所在的志愿者小组目前已经出资帮扶近30人。
For those who meet the help criteria, the small fish's volunteer team has so far helped nearly 30 people.
不断汇总的信息中，负责线上统计、核对的小鱼大致拼凑出一个独居老人在家中的画面。
Constantly aggregated information, responsible for online statistics, small fish collated together a single elderly person in the home screen.
“住在老旧社区里，没有办法出去买菜，有的还有一两天就会断粮。
"There's no way to go out and buy food in old neighborhoods," he says. "Some are going without food for a day or two.
”小鱼说，活动的首要目的是解决老人的基本生活保障问题。
"The primary purpose of the campaign is to solve the basic livelihood problems of the elderly," Fisher said.
6日，曾接受过帮助的张先生告诉澎湃新闻，自己的亲属年过七旬，因患有慢性病，儿女不在身边，两位老人在家中买不到菜十分着急。
On the 6th, Mr. Zhang, a former helper, told the roar news that his relatives were over 70 and that the two elderly people were worried that they could not buy food at home because of a chronic disease and the absence of their children.
张先生在看到朋友圈中有转发“寻找独居老人”的活动海报便扫码填写求助信息。
Mr. Zhang scans for help messages when he sees posters in his circle of friends forwarding "Looking for a lonely old man."
在通过志愿者核实后，小鱼在APP上让骑手下单购买了一周的菜量，将菜送到了两位独居老人的手中。
After verification by volunteers, the fish let the rider order a week's food on the APP and delivered it to two old people who lived alone.
张先生说，在社区精力有限的情况下，今后会继续考虑通过民间志愿者团队来帮两位老人买菜。
Mr. Zhang said he would continue to consider buying vegetables for two elderly people through volunteer teams in the future, given the limited energy available in the community.
有受助的老人对他们表示感谢。
Recipient elderly people thanked them.
也有人因为没得到帮助质疑小鱼等人是在作秀。
Others doubt that small fish and others are showing off because they have no help.
对此，小鱼有些难过，“我们能力实在有限”，帮不了每一个人。
To this, small fish is a little sad, "we really limited capacity", can not help everyone.
志愿者小鱼发布的寻找“无法取菜的独居老人”海报 本文图片均为受访者提供以下为小鱼的自述寻找无法取菜的独居老人我叫小鱼，今年26岁，在武汉经营着一家小酒吧。
2007-9-25 21: 16 Looking for a Single Old Man Who Can't Get a Dish 2007-9-25 21: 48 Here are some tips for finding a lonely old man who can't get a meal. My name is Fish.
受疫情影响，小酒吧暂停营业，我每天都在家里隔离，空闲时间比较多。
Affected by the epidemic, the small bar is closed, I am isolated at home every day, more free time.
一次偶然的机会，我在一个志愿者群里了解到，有志愿者关注到疫情之下，独居老人买菜难的问题。
A chance, I learned in a group of volunteers, volunteers concerned about the epidemic, living alone elderly people to buy food difficult.
他们问我所在的A2N疫情志愿小组能不能够协助。
They asked me if my A2N volunteer team could help.
我们讨论之后，决定由四位志愿者参与负责。
After our discussion, it was decided that four volunteers would be in charge.
2月26日我们在微博上发布“寻找武汉市内无法取菜的独居老人”的海报。
On Feb. 26, we posted a poster on Weibo, "Looking for single elderly people who can't get food in Wuhan."
加微信的人很多，至少有上千人加我的微信。
There was a large number of people, at least a thousand plus my message.
这些人大多数是老人的家属，以及小部分是想要帮助我们的热心网友。
Most of these people are family members of the elderly, and a small number are eager netizens who want to help us.
我们这项志愿活动提供的帮助是解决老人基本的生活保障问题，保证老人有菜吃。
The help we provide through this voluntary activity is to provide basic livelihood security for the elderly and to ensure that they have food to eat.
还有的老人会在求助信息中提出其他要求，比如家里没有燃气了、没有口罩等。
Others ask for help in the form of a gas-free home or a mask.
不是所有寻求帮助的人，最后都会得到我们的帮助。
Not all those who ask for help will get our help in the end.
在海报上，我们附上了二维码，里面需要填写一些信息。
On the poster, we attached a two-dimensional code with some information to fill in.
比如老人的基本信息、家属有没有主动向所在社区寻求过帮助、社区是如何答复的，还有家属为老人购菜过程中尝试过哪些购菜平台等信息。
For example, basic information about the elderly, whether family members have actively sought help from their communities, how the community has responded, and what platforms families have tried to purchase food for the elderly.
之所以需要填写这些信息，是因为我们想要帮助的是那些边缘的、尝试过各种办法购菜但没有成功的独居老人。
We need to fill in this information because we want to help the marginal, unsuccessful, single elderly people who have tried everything they can to buy food.
汇总了这些信息后，我大致拼凑出这些独居老人的特征。
Having assembled all this information, I have roughly pieced together the characteristics of these elderly people who live alone.
有一些是孤寡老人；大部分是有儿女，但跟儿女不在同一个小区。
Some are widowed; most have children, but not in the same neighbourhood as their children.
还有一部分老人是身体有残疾、慢性病，或是急性病的。
Some of the elderly are physically disabled, chronically ill, or acute.
寻求帮助的这些信息紧迫程度不一，我们认为最紧迫的情况是老人家里的菜只够撑两三天和一些身体不好，有疾病的老人。
The urgency of seeking help varies, and we believe that the most pressing situation is that the food in the home will last only two or three days and some elderly people who are not in good health and are ill.
如何帮助这些老人，我们有三个解决办法。
There are three ways we can help these elderly people.
第一是我们志愿者个人出资，叫跑腿小哥帮忙买菜，然后送给老人。
The first is that our volunteers personally funded, called errands to help buy vegetables, and then sent to the elderly.
第二种，如果距离我们志愿者比较近的话，我们志愿者会自己去菜场买菜，然后开车送给老人。
Second, if we were closer to our volunteers, we would go to the market ourselves to buy vegetables and then drive them to the old people.
第三种情况，我们帮他们跟社区对接，寻求社区的援助。
Third, we help them connect with the community and seek its assistance.
给老人送的菜，我们会根据菜场的实际情况来决定。
The food we give to the old people will be decided according to the actual situation of the market.
有时候考虑到买太多的话，有一些蔬菜容易坏，所以我们一次送菜的量是够老人食用一个星期的量，土豆、南瓜、白萝卜，这些放的比较久的食材可能会多给一些。
Sometimes when we think about buying too much, there are some vegetables that break easily, so the amount of food we deliver at once is enough for the old people to eat for a week. Potatoes, pumpkins, radishes, these longer-lived ingredients may be given more.
很重要的环节是核对老人信息从收集独居老人信息开始，到线下送菜，还有一个很重要的环节是核对老人信息。
It is very important to check the elderly information from the collection of information on the elderly living alone, to send food offline, there is a very important link is to check the elderly information.
我和我们小伙伴四个人，每个人都会打电话一一核实情况。
I'm with four of our little buddies, and everyone calls to check the situation.
信息核对过程中会出现很多问题。
There are many problems in the process of checking information.
大部分情况下，我们需要向老人本人进行核实，会有部分亲属没有尝试过其他办法，就直接让我们帮助。
For the most part, we need to check with the elderly themselves, and some of our relatives will ask us to help us without trying anything else.
这个月的3号和4号，这两天我遇到一个很糟心的事情，我们直接被老人家属怀疑是不是真的在做实事，这种怀疑让我们有些心寒。
This month on the 3rd and 4th, I encountered a very bad thing these two days, we are directly by the old people doubt whether the real thing is really doing, the doubt made us a little chilled.
老人将近90岁，住的是老社区，求助信息上说，“好久没有吃鱼、肉，每天吃点青菜和鸡蛋，剃须刀坏了，又买不到。
The old man, nearly 90 years old, lives in the old community, and the help message says, "I haven't eaten fish or meat for a long time, I have eaten vegetables and eggs every day, my razor is broken and I can't buy it.
”我们审核了这位老人的信息后，建议他再次和本社区的工作人员联系寻求帮助。
"After checking the old man's information, we advised him to contact the community again for help.
因为我们了解到这个社区对独居老人是有帮扶政策的，如果他不知道怎么联系，我们可以帮助他和社区进行沟通协调。
Because we've learned that this community has a policy of helping older people who live alone, and if he doesn't know how to contact them, we can help him communicate with his community.
我把这个回复信息发送给对方之后，没想到对方质疑我们平台是个“秀台”，还说，“你们太假了，早上求救，还挂电话”，要投诉我们。
I sent this reply to each other, did not expect the other side questioned our platform is a "stage", and said, "You are too false, call for help in the morning, and hang up the phone," to complain us.
实际情况其实是我手机没电了，没及时接通。
In fact, the fact is that my phone ran out of electricity, not connected in time.
我看到质疑，心情有些失落。
I see doubt, the mood is a little frustrated.
另一位志愿者告诉我，遇到这种情况，先别慌，可能老人家属和平台存在信息沟通不对等的情况。
Another volunteer told me that when faced with this situation, don't panic, maybe there is unequal communication between the old people's genus and the platform.
可以通过电话和短信告诉他们，先去社区寻求帮助。
They can be told by phone and text message to seek help in the community first.
“疫情期间资源有限”，这是需要跟求助者反复强调的内容，我们志愿服务也尽量规避一些风险。
"Resources are limited during an epidemic," a message that needs to be repeated with suitors, and we volunteer to avoid as many risks as possible.
后来我跟这位老人所在的社区打电话沟通。
Then I called the old man's community.
社区给我的反馈是，已经知道这位老人的情况，社区工作人员已经上门，前天送了12斤菜，这位老人的问题已经得到解决。
The feedback from the community was that the old man's condition was known, that the community workers had come to me and that the old man's problems had been solved by giving him 12 kilos of vegetables the day before yesterday.
在帮助独居老人的过程中，我也了解了社区网格员的工作。
In helping elderly people who live alone, I also learned about the work of community grid workers.
我们跟社区的网格员沟通发现，他们的工作量大，一个网格员可能要负责一栋楼里的几百户居民的日常需求，任务量非常重。
We talked to the grid workers in the community and found that they had such a heavy workload that a grid worker might be responsible for the daily needs of hundreds of families living in a building.
5号早上，我还接到通知，说是武汉各街道社区在不影响正常防控工作的前提下，合理安排社区工作者轮休1到3天，可想而知，社区工作者目前可能没有休息过。
On the morning of the 5th, I was also informed that Wuhan street communities were rationally taking one to three days off for community workers, without prejudice to the normal work of prevention and control.
志愿者们给谢奶奶买的菜78岁的奶奶给我唱了一首歌和老人沟通交流的过程中需要一些同理心，设身处地为他们着想。
The volunteers bought Grandma Xie's food. My 78-year-old grandmother sang me a song and talked to the old man with empathy and empathy.
我的第一位求助者是一位78岁的奶奶，姓谢。
My first suitor was a 78-year-old grandmother named Xie.
在我和她沟通的过程中，我们俩成了很好的朋友。
In the course of my communication with her, we became very good friends.
她是能够和我互相建立起信任感的一位老人。
She is an old man who can build up a sense of trust with me.
谢奶奶一个人独居了十几年，丈夫去世后，她没有子女。
Grandma Xie lived alone for more than ten years. After her husband died, she had no children.
将近一个月的时间，谢奶奶靠着年前屯的年货撑到了现在，最后吃的只剩下稀饭和黑木耳。
For nearly a month, Grandma Xie was able to survive on her New Year's Eve. All she ate was porridge and black fungus.
了解了这些信息之后，我们开始联系各种渠道帮助她。
Knowing this information, we began to contact various channels to help her.
在沟通的过程中，她一直说不想麻烦社区，害怕浪费资源，拒绝社区的帮助。
In the process, she said she did not want to annoy the community, waste resources and refuse help from the community.
我直接跟进她的需求后，在外卖平台下单，让骑手去菜市场买。
I followed up her demand directly and ordered the rider to go to the Halles market.
武汉小区24小时封闭之后，像中百超市、武商超市只针对社区团购，不能个人团购，还有些菜市场可以凭借出入证进去购买。
Wuhan after the 24-hour closure, like the supermarkets, Wu shopping supermarkets only for community groups, not individual group purchase, there are some vegetable markets can be bought by way of a pass.
跑腿小哥买菜也不是很好买，因为有些菜市场可能食材不够，买不到一周的量，所以也需要一些时间。
Running errands are not easy to buy, because some markets may not have enough ingredients to buy a week's supply, so it will take some time.
大概在3号下午6点钟左右，菜送到了谢奶奶的家里，我们给她买了快2公斤土豆，还有上海青、大白菜、里脊肉、茄子和番茄，应该够她一个人吃一周的。
At about 6 p.m. on the 3rd, the food was delivered to Grandma Xie's house, and we bought her nearly 2 kilos of potatoes, as well as Shanghai green, Chinese cabbage, ribs, eggplant and tomatoes, which should be enough to feed her alone for a week.
给谢奶奶一周的菜花了321.7元，这些钱都是我们志愿活动发起人自己出资。
I spent 321.7 yuan for Grandma Xie's weekly cauliflower, which was paid for by the sponsors of our volunteer activities.
目前我们的公共资金已经花了大几万了，后续关于资金的问题，我们可能会筹集一些。
We've already spent tens of thousands of dollars on public money, and we might raise some more on the question of money.
跟谢奶奶聊天，她会不定时跟我分享她的生活动态。
Talk to Grandma Xie. She will share her life dynamics with me from time to time.
我零星了解到，她的爱好很广泛，平时在家写毛笔字、自己做衣服穿，虽然看起来她把自己的独居生活安排得很充实，但情感上，她是缺乏关爱的。
I have learned sporadically that her hobbies are very extensive, usually at home writing handwriting, making their own clothes, although it seems that she has their own living alone very substantial, but emotional, she is lack of love.
小鱼答应谢奶奶，疫情结束后去看她在菜送上门之后，我们也并没有结束聊天。
Small fish agreed to Xie Granny, after the outbreak of the disease to see her after the food delivered to the door, we did not end the conversation.
她有时候看到我忙到晚上8点多，还关心我，唱首歌给我听，闹我开心。
She sometimes sees me busy till 8 p. m., still cares about me, sings a song to me, makes me happy.
有时候她很感谢我，给我发消息说，“你愿意与老太太聊天，不嫌弃，真好！”我看到这些很感动，我已经跟奶奶说好，疫情结束后上门去看她。
Sometimes she thanked me enough to send me a message saying, "It's nice to talk to the old lady, not to give up!" I've seen it so touching, and I have agreed with Grandma to come and see her after the outbreak.
