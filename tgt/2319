过去，网红店过网红店的，卖咖啡的卖咖啡，纯靠卖书的踏踏实实解决温饱，但如今，它们都“歇菜”了。
In the past, the net red shop over the net, coffee sales, rely solely on the sales of books, but now, they are "off the table."
记者 | 张峰 实习生 | 陈淦博、余晓璐编辑 | 沈小山终于开店了。
GAN CHAN BO and Yu Xiaolu Edit & # 45; Shen Hill has finally opened a shop.
过去的一个月，对于那些个体经营的实体书店来说，是危机击穿底线的三十天。
The past month has been a 30-day crisis for self-employed physical bookstores.
2月5号，一份《2020年春节实体书店紧急调查分析报告》出炉，涉及1021家一线城市和80%的二三线及更下沉的书店，其中90%关闭，99%无正常收入。
On February 5, an urgent investigation and analysis report for the 2020 Spring Festival Bookstore was published, involving 1,021 first-tier cities and 80 per cent of second- and third-tier bookstores, 90 per cent of which were closed and 99 per cent had no regular income.
当然，疫情带来的影响不仅仅是春节旺季收入的泡汤，现金流紧张带来的亏损压力，还直接加速了关于“怎么活”的讨论：过去，网红店过网红店的，卖咖啡的卖咖啡，纯靠卖书的踏踏实实解决温饱，但如今，它们都“歇菜”了。
Of course, the epidemic's impact is not just a loss of revenue during the Spring Festival season, cash-flow stress, but also directly accelerates the debate about how to live: in the past, the red-net-store coffee sellers used to rely solely on selling books to feed and clothe, but now they are "off the table."
书店“救穷”可耻，那是自己商业模式的问题，但“救急”是不得不出的招2月20号，江西南昌市文化地标之一的青苑书店迎来了2020年的第一场书友会——线上微信读者群，主题是“阅读，能给我们带来什么？”你可以想象200多人的群里，失去了公共空间，人们在各自封闭的家中，盘着腿，拿着书，听着语音，有的人被电话叫走临时关闭了界面，有的人要给孩子喂奶被迫走开，主办者不知道有多少人真的在听，但好在，有人在听。
One of the cultural landmarks in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, February 20, welcomed the first online reading group of 200 people - reading, holding books, listening to voice, people in their own closed homes, temporarily closed the interface, the organizers do not know how many people are actually listening.
青苑书店可能是最早在网上公开求助读者的独立书店之一。
The Green Garden Bookstore may have been one of the first independent bookstores to open its doors to readers online.
一月的最后一天，正是疫情最严重和混乱的时候，老板万国英在自家公众号发表了《我是青苑书店，请不要让我冻毙于风雪》的文章，推出了200-2000元不等的充值卡业务，“恳请读者伸出援手”，回笼现金流。
On the last day of January, just as the epidemic was worst and most chaotic, the boss, Wan Guoying, published the article "I'm a Green Garden Bookstore, Please Don't Let Me Frost Snow" on his public website.
万国英没在文里说亏损有多严重，实际上是店里一个月支出30多万，年底刚刚和出版社、供应商结算，还有一批新书的预付款，加上给员工的年终奖，一月账上只剩下十多万。
In fact, the store was spending more than 300,000 dollars a month, settling accounts with publishers and suppliers at the end of the year, and making advance payments for new books and year-end bonuses for employees, leaving more than 100,000 in January.
一位带戴口罩的顾客在青苑书店想着至少在春节止损，万国英延续了一年书店只放两天假：年三十和大年初一的传统，挺着开到了正月初四，发现一天见不到几个人，老读者老面孔都没了，开店还不如不开。
A customer wearing a mask in a bookstore in Qingyuan thinks that at least during the Spring Festival holiday, Wan Guoying will have two days off at the bookstore for at least two days: New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
几天后，政府下了文件，企业不得在2月10号之前营业，之后开店的时间延了又延。
A few days later, the government issued a document stating that businesses would not be allowed to open until February 10, after which time the opening of the store was delayed.
“我们属于文化服务行业，最后一批复工。
"We belong to the cultural services industry and we are the last to resume work.
企业在自救，政府说疫情结束后可以打报告申请一个月到一个半月的免租，那都是以后的事儿，实际操作不知道遇到什么麻烦。
Enterprises are self-help, the government said the end of the epidemic can report a month to a month and a half rent-free, that is all after the event, do not know in practice encountered any trouble.
”远水解不了近渴，开店28年来，万国英第一次为青苑“活下来”担忧。
Far water can't quench thirst, and for the first time in 28 years, Britain was worried about the "survival" of the park.
同样网上求助的还有广州的文化标签“1200bookshop”。
Also available online is the Guangzhou cultural label "1200 bookshop."
这家在2015年就被CNN评选为世界17家最酷的书店之一的独立书店，开业以来从未熄灯，坚持24小时不打烊，不定时邀请保安、流浪歌手进行演讲，每周六晚十二点举办“深夜分享会”，成为社交媒体上“因为一个书店爱上一座城市”被提及率最高的小店之一。
The independent bookstore, named by CNN as one of the world's 17 coolest bookstores in 2015, has never turned off its lights since it opened, keeping its doors open 24 hours a day, occasionally inviting security guards, street singers to speak, holding a late-night sharing session every Saturday night at 12: 00 pm, making it one of the most talked about stores on social media "Because a bookstore loves a city."
当然，所有的魅力源自线下，店门一关，几乎阻断了一切。
Of course, all the glamour comes offline, and the door shuts off almost everything.
各类活动一直是1200bookshop的特色 图/甜约翰1200的创始人刘二囍和他的团队更年轻，除了储值卡，还做了“盲选图书礼包”和文创产品，救急的姿势更丰富，不到两天，筹到了四十多万，能再撑两个月。
Both Mr. Liu and his team are still younger. In addition to their storage cards, they have also created a Blind Book Gift Pack and a Wenchuan product to provide a richer emergency posture. In less than two days, more than 400,000 people have been brought up for two more months.
刘二囍承认这种“粉丝经济”带来的优势，过去的几年中，1200在扩张，几乎每年1200都会开新店，从个体化到公司化的运作下，将赚到的钱再投入到新的项目中，或许一定程度导致1200抵御风险的能力较弱。
Mr. Liu acknowledges the benefits of this "fan economy." Over the past few years, 1,200 new stores have been opened every year. As a result, the money generated will be reinvested into new projects, possibly resulting in a degree of vulnerability to risk.
在一些调查中提到，品牌连锁书店的实际情况在可控范围内，言几又公共事务总监周娟认为大企业过得可能“更不好”。
In some surveys, the reality of branded bookstores is manageable, and Zhou Juangnan, the public affairs director, said big companies might be "worse off."
言几又直营店和加盟店在疫情期间客流遭断崖式下滑，门店损失95%的营业额。
Several direct shops and franchises suffered a precipitous drop in passenger flow during the epidemic, with stores losing 95 per cent of their turnover.
即使第一时间线上推出了“同城配送”的补救措施，周娟也坦言，短期成效很难判断，只是做出的努力，总不能什么都不干。
Even if the first time line launched "with the city distribution" remedial measures, Zhou Juan admitted, short-term results are difficult to judge, just efforts, always can not do nothing.
言几又在全国各大城市商业区店铺平均面积达到了1000平方米，租金成了最大的支出，政府的减租意见是指导性的，和商场主体的沟通协商也只能是“尝试性的”。
Speech in the major cities and business districts in the average store area of 1000 square meters, rent has become the largest expenditure, the government rent reduction advice is guiding, and the main business communication and consultation can only be "tentative."
而公开数据显示，2019年前十个月言几又销售额为6个亿，名列全国销售额十强书店第二名。
In the first 10 months of 2019, sales topped the top 10 bookstores in the country with sales of just 600 million, according to open data.
那些愿意发声、尝试转变的书店毕竟是少数，更多的书店散布在四五线城市，在街角默默无闻，仿佛岁月停滞了般，做着自己最擅长的事，悄无声息的消亡。
After all, the few bookstores that are willing to speak out and try to change are a few, with more bookstores scattered around the four or five-lane city, obscure on street corners, as if years had stopped doing what they were best at, and died quietly.
网上打五折，你会为了“氛围”为全价书买单吗？实际上，实体书店对于这个时代来说，就像不愿离去的慢性病患者，疫情只是催化剂，过去的一年里，病情就有恶化的趋势。
Can you pay for 50% off the Internet for the "atmosphere" of a full-price book? In fact, physical bookstores are a catalyst for an age when, like chronically ill patients who don't want to leave, the epidemic has only worsened over the past year.
万国英从2018年下半年开始感觉实体书店近五年短暂的春天过去了。
Wan Guoying from the second half of 2018 began to feel that the physical bookstore nearly five years of short spring has passed.
网上折扣战不停，从原本年度性的“618”、“双11”、“双12”，到季度打折，2019年开始电商平台几乎每月都有促销折扣。
Online discount wars, from the original annual "618," "double 11," "double 12," to quarterly discounts, 2019 began almost every month electronic commerce platform sales.
“打折打到我的朋友都去网上买，中华书局和三联，打到38折到42折，我们和出版社根本这个价进货都进不到。
"Discounts to my friends to buy online, the Chinese Book Bureau and the three, hit 38 discount to 42%, we and the publishing house this price can not enter.
商务给我们店是68折，三联65折，怎么竞争？”万国英提供的一个行业零售检测数据显示，2019年实体书店销售额下滑7.68%，网络销售增长24.7%。
Business to our store is 68% discount, three 65% discount, how to compete? "Physical bookstore sales dropped 7.68% in 2019, while online sales grew 24.7%, according to an industry retail survey conducted by Wan Guoying.
这其中还包括了新华书店这样巨无霸型的国有企业。
It also includes giant state-owned enterprises such as Xinhua Bookstore.
这些下滑来自于图书本身结构的变化和出版社的重心转移。
These declines are due to changes in the structure of the book itself and the shift in emphasis in publishing houses.
疫情期间的青苑书店万国英发现，新华书店增长的销售额里，社科类图书提高了30%-40%，这个数据中，又有大部分来自于政党图书。
During the outbreak, Wan Guoying, a bookstore in Qingyuan, found that the number of social science books in Xinhua bookstore increased by 30% -40%.
万国英所在的江西省，新华书店社科类中政党图书比重甚至达到五成。
In Jiangxi Province, where all countries are located, the proportion of books in the social science category of Xinhua Bookstore reaches 50%.
如果剔除掉这些给政府部门的指定性刚需项目，实体书店的下滑远远不止之前的数字。
If you cut out these designated items for government departments, the decline in physical bookstores is much more than that.
同时能选的书“越来越少”，《2019中国图书市场报告》显示，2019年新出出版品种数只有2018年的80%，没人能指望80种图书卖出100种的价格和销售。
With fewer books to choose from, the 2019 China Book Market Report shows that the number of new titles in 2019 will be only 80% of 2018, and no one can expect 80 titles to be sold for 100.
和实体书店休戚相关的出版社越来越远离实体书店，整体向网络平台靠拢，出版社在实体书店的销售任务逐渐下降。
And the physical bookstore related to the publishing house more and more away from the physical bookstore, the overall approach to the network platform, publishing house sales in the physical bookstore gradually decline.
据万国英了解，有电商平台强制设立固定利润额和返点要求，出版社要想获得销售数量和知名度的上涨，就只能被动地接受。
According to Wan Guoying, there is a fixed profit and return requirements imposed by the electric business platform, publishers can only receive the increase in sales volume and visibility, can only passively accept.
出版社摆脱平台掣肘的一种方式是自营网店，走的依旧是拦腰折扣方式。
Publishers from the platform constraints of a way is self-employed shop, continue to take the way of waist discount.
在天猫商务印书馆旗舰店里，2020年新版成语大词典原价99.8，折后价49.9元，立即下单再减3元，线下接近百元的图书，读者直接在出版社买，只要46.9元。
In the flagship store of Tiancat Commercial Press, the 2020 edition of the idiom dictionary will cost 99.8 yuan at a discount of 49.9 yuan, with an immediate reduction of 3 yuan for books close to 100 yuan offline. Readers will pay 46.9 yuan directly from the publishers.
这就形成了新的局面，线上平台和出版社挤压实体书店生存空间，出版社利润受损开店单干，出版的做的事情越来越多，模糊了上下游关系，书店作为一个简单地安放图书的空间，变得越来越尴尬。
This has created a new situation, with online platforms and publishing houses squeezing living space in physical bookstores, publishing houses losing profits opening their own stores, publishing more and more things, blurring the relationship between upstream and downstream, and bookstores becoming more and more awkward as a simple place to put books.
压力下万国英开始尝试之前从来不会做的事情：参与项目招标。
Under pressure, Britain is beginning to try something it never would have done before: get involved in bidding for projects.
帮助大学图书馆选书。
Help the university library select books.
而一般的图书馆大学图书馆招标基本上被新华书店拿走。
But the general library university library tender is taken away by the Xinhua bookstore basically.
同时，文创和咖啡的营业也贡献了一部分收入。
At the same time, Wenchuang and coffee business also contributed part of the revenue.
”他们都说你可以多元化经营，多做些事情。
They say you can diversify and do more.
“万国英始终认为专注于图书和选书已经让团队十分吃力了。
"Universal Studios has always believed that focusing on books and choosing books has put a lot of strain on the team.
”哪有那么多精力做别的呢？你本身行业就做不好，还做别的东西？我就是一个纯粹的店家。
"How can you have so much energy to do otherwise? You can't do well in your own business, and do something else? I'm a pure shopkeeper.
“开店了，依然有人在求救在全面复工的第一天，坚持了15年的单向街书店发文“众筹续命”，创始人许知远终究没能抗住。
"Shop opening, people still call for help on the first day of full resumption of work, adhere to the 15-year-old one-way street bookstore" crowd-funding ", founder Xu Zhiyuan failed to resist.
1200开店了，疫情影响还没散去，依然没什么人，最多二十几个“勇士”，有客人来拍探店视频，更多的是直来直去，买书，走人，成交率反而上去了。
1200 shop opened, the impact of the epidemic is still not dispersed, there are still no people, up to 20 "Warriors," visitors to shoot video shop, more is straight, buy books, walk, turnover rate instead up.
阿尔贝·加缪《鼠疫》买断了库存，而之前买的最好的是胡适的《容忍与自由》。
Albert Camus Buried Plague sold out of stock, and the best he had ever bought was Hu Shi's "Tolerance and Freedom."
1200bookshop图/芳芳店员在体育东店拍了个短视频，把一张写着红字“权力”的牌子放进鸟笼挂了起来，成为了新“宠物”。
The shop assistant took a short video at the East Sports Store and put a sign with the word "Power" on it. It was hung up in a cage and became the new Pet.
1200bookshop依然在探索“特色”和“自由”，在商业和价值中间寻找平衡，针对图书的“盲选”和“药房”赋予的文化价值既带给了读者新鲜感，又能拉动销售额。
The 1,200 bookshop still explores "identity" and "freedom," striking a balance between business and value, and the cultural values given to books by "blind shopping" and "pharmacies" give readers a sense of freshness and boost sales.
总结起来为什么能在危难之时获得巨大的粉丝支持，刘二囍觉得跟高大上的书店比较起来，1200可能更加有人情味和接地气，另一个是青年属性，就像垮掉的一代的这种集体式的精神。
Mr. Liu believes that Mr. Liu is more humane and grounding than a tall bookstore, and that he is a young man, just like the collective spirit of the Beat generation.
1200bookshop图/芳芳这次疫情让1200的图书总监阿多海意识到之前对于线上的不够重视，而这种趋势“是不可阻挡的。
The outbreak has prompted 1200-year-old librarian Addo Hai to realize that the previous lack of focus on the line was "unstoppable."
”但是他能想到的也就是线上开书店卖书，限时秒杀，或者运营微信群。
But all he could think of was opening an online bookstore to sell books, time limits to kill, or running a microcosm.
知名书店人孙谦在自己的直播中谈到新背景下的书店前景，套用了时下最流行的语言：“书店应该运营自己的私域流量。
In his live broadcast, Sun Qian, a well-known bookstore owner, talked about the future of bookstores in the new context, applying the most popular language of the day: "A bookstore should run its own private traffic.
”万国英担忧的依旧是书店仍然面临致命的生存压力，这次疫情波及的不止书店，还有出版社，恢复生产后去库存压力，加大折扣力度是不可避免的，这是商业规律，对她来说，也是无解的。
Britain's concern remains that bookstores are still under deadly pressure to survive, not just in bookstores, but also in publishing houses, and that greater discounts are inevitable and unsolvable for her as long as production resumes.
她担忧实体书店“青黄不接”，好的书店不能在这次“大难”里逃出来，“接”上去续命。
She worried that the physical bookstore "green," good bookstores can not escape in this "disaster," "pick up" on the life.
“经济的事情事后是可以弥补回来的，但是在文明的建设和沉淀中，文化属性可能就沉默了。
"Economic things can be made up for afterwards, but in the construction and precipitation of civilization, cultural attributes may be silent."
”万国英还想多进一些音乐、医学类的科普类的书，推出一些心理学的读书单。
Wan also wants to add more popular science books on music and medicine and introduce some psychological reading lists.
“因为在这个疫情以后，肯定很多人有些情绪上面的一些波动，还有对未来的一些担忧，在医学科技普及，还有情绪健康这一块，青苑是可以做一些事情的。
"Because after this outbreak, there must be some fluctuation in the mood of many people, and there are some worries about the future. There are things that can be done in the area of medical technology and emotional health.
