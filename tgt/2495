澎湃新闻记者 贺梨萍当地时间2月28日，由国家卫健委高级别专家组组长、中国工程院院士钟南山领衔的“中国2019新型冠状病毒疾病的临床特征”研究论文在顶级医学期刊《新英格兰医学杂志》（NEJM）上在线公开发表。
"Clinical Features of the New Coronavirus Disease in China 2019," led by Zhong Nan-shan, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of a high-level panel of experts, was published online in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the top medical journal.
该研究纳入了自2019年12月11日至2020年1月29日来自全国31个省(市)共552家医院的1099例确诊新冠肺炎患者。
The study included 1,099 confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia from 11 December 2019 to 29 January 2020 in 552 hospitals in 31 provinces (municipalities) across the country.
该研究的作者共有37名，作者单位包括国家呼吸系统疾病临床医学研究中心、武汉市金银潭医院、华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院、广州医科大学第一附属医院胸肿瘤科、黄冈市中心医院、南方医科大学器官衰竭防治国家重点实验室、香港中文大学、中国医学科学院北京协和医学院、浙江大学医学院附属第一医院传染病诊治国家重点实验室等。
The study was written by 37 authors, including National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, Jintan Hospital of Wuhan City, Tongji Medical College Affiliated Concorde Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, Huanggang City Central Hospital, National Key Laboratory for Organ Failure Prevention and Control, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Chinese Academy of Medicine, Beijing Concorde Medical School, Zhejiang University First Hospital.
钟南山为通讯作者，研究团队代表中国新冠肺炎医疗专家组。
Zhong Nan Shan is a communications writer, and the research team represents the Chinese New Crown Pneumonia Medical Expert Group.
此前的当地时间2月9日，该论文在向《新英格兰医学杂志》投稿的同时，也同时在预印本网站medRxiv上率先公开（当时未经同行评议），并引起了广泛关注。
Earlier, Feb. 9, the paper, while contributing to the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to be published (without peer review) on the pre-print site, medRxiv, and attracted a lot of attention.
该项研究显示，在1099例患者中，926例为非重症，173例为重症。
The study showed that of 1,099 patients, 926 were non-severe and 173 were severe.
重症患者的年龄比非重症患者大7岁（中位数）。
Patients with severe illness are 7 years older (median) than those who are not.
此外，重症患者有合并症的情况（38.7%）比非重症患者（21.0%）常见。
In addition, complications were more common in severe cases (38.7 per cent) than in non-severe cases (21.0 per cent).
不过，重症患者和非重症患者的暴露史相似。
However, the history of exposure was similar for severe and non-severe patients.
研究得出的中位潜伏期为4天（四分位距，2-7），重度、非重度组新冠患者各有一例患者的潜伏期达24天。
The mean latency was 4 days (quartile, 2-7) and 24 days in each of the patients with severe and non-severe crown.
不过，团队认为，单纯根据最小、最大值评估人群的潜伏期容易引起误读。
However, the team believes that it is easy to misinterpret a population's incubation period based solely on minimum and maximum values.
值得注意的是，入院时43.8%的患者有发热，但住院期间88.7%有发热。
It is worth noting that 43.8 per cent of the patients admitted had fever, but 88.7 per cent had fever during hospitalization.
不发热的新冠肺炎患者比例高于SARS-CoV（1%）和MERS-CoV（2%）感染患者，因此如果监测病例的定义侧重于检测发热，则不发热的患者可能会被漏诊。
The proportion of patients with non-febrile pneumonia is higher than that of patients with SARS-CoV (1 per cent) and MERS-CoV (2 per cent), so if the definition of surveillance cases focuses on detection of fever, non-febrile patients may be missed.
相对于SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV，新冠病毒的致死率较低。
Compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the mortality of new crown virus was lower.
研究团队在这项研究中确定的病死率为1.4%，低于近期其他团队报道的病死率。
The team identified a 1.4 percent fatality rate in the study, lower than the rate reported by other recent teams.
他们认为，原因很可能是样本量和病例纳入标准的差异。
The reason, they argue, may well be the difference between sample sizes and the inclusion of cases.
他们同时认为，由于轻症患者和未就医患者并未纳入本研究，因此真实的病死率可能更低。
They also believe that the true fatality rate is likely to be even lower, since light patients and those who are not treated are not included in the study.
研究团队还强调，尽管新冠病毒和SARS-CoV具有种属相似性，但一些临床特征可以将新冠肺炎与SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV及季节性流感区分开来。
The team also stressed that despite the genetic similarity between the new crown virus and SARS-CoV, some clinical features distinguish it from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and seasonal influenza.
不能排除“超级传播者”的存在研究团队获得了2019年12月11日至2020年1月29日期间国家卫健委收到的，经实验室确诊的新冠肺炎住院患者和门诊患者的病历，并汇总了数据。
It cannot be excluded that the "Super Communicator" presence team obtained the medical records of inpatients and outpatients diagnosed with Newcomial Pneumonia received by the National Board of Health between 11 December 2019 and 29 January 2020 and summarized the data.
研究数据截止日期为2020年1月31日。
The cut-off date for research data is 31 January 2020.
新冠肺炎确诊病例的定义为鼻拭子和咽拭子样本高通量测序或实时逆转录-聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）检测结果呈阳性。
Confirmed cases of Newly Coronary Pneumonia are defined as high-throughput sequencing of nasal swab and swabbing subsamples or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive.
仅实验室确诊病例被纳入分析。
Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis.
研究团队从电子病历提取了患者的近期暴露史、临床症状或体征以及入院时的实验室检查结果。
The team extracted the patient's recent history of exposure, clinical symptoms or signs from an electronic medical record and the results of a laboratory examination at the time of admission.
影像学评估包括胸片或CT，所有实验室检查均根据患者的临床诊治需求实施。
Imaging evaluation includes chest radiography or CT, and all laboratory examinations are performed according to the patient's clinical needs.
实验室评估包括全血细胞计数、血液化学分析、凝血试验、肝肾功能评估，以及电解质、C反应蛋白、降钙素原、乳酸脱氢酶和肌酸激酶测定。
The laboratory assessment included whole blood count, hemagglutination test, liver and kidney function assessment, and determination of electrolytes, C-reactive protein, calcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase.
根据美国胸科学会（American Thoracic Society）的社区获得性肺炎指南，研究团队将患者入院时的新冠肺炎严重程度分为严重和非严重。
According to the American Thoracic Society's Community Guidelines for Obtaining Pneumonia, the team classified the severity of new crown pneumonia on admission as severe and non-severe.
截至2020年1月29日，有7736例新冠肺炎患者在552家研究中心住院治疗，研究团队获得了其中1099例患者（14.2%）的临床症状和结局数据。
As of January 29, 2020, 7736 patients with Newly Coronary Pneumonia were hospitalized in 552 research centers, and the research team obtained clinical symptoms and outcome data for 1099 cases (14.2%).
武汉金银潭医院收治的患者量最大（132例）。
The largest number of patients (132 cases) was admitted to Wuhan Gold and Silver Pool Hospital.
全国30个省、自治区和直辖市有1856家收治新冠肺炎患者的定点医院，该项研究纳入的医院占了其中的29.7%。
The study included 29.7 percent of 1,856 designated hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government.
该项研究纳入的患者中，3.5%为医务人员，1.9%有野生动物接触史；483例患者（43.9%）为武汉居民。
Of those included in the study, 3.5 per cent were medical staff, 1.9 per cent had a history of wildlife exposure and 483 cases (43.9 per cent) were Wuhan residents.
在武汉外居住的患者中，72.3%有与武汉居民的接触史，其中31.3%曾去过武汉；25.9%的非武汉居民既未去过武汉，也无与武汉居民的接触史。
Of those living outside Wuhan, 72.3 percent had contact with Wuhan residents, of whom 31.3 percent had visited Wuhan, while 25.9 percent of non-Wuhan residents had neither visited Wuhan nor had any contact with Wuhan residents.
研究团队认为，分析显示约2%的患者有野生动物直接接触史，四分之三以上的患者是武汉居民、曾去过武汉或曾有与武汉居民的接触史。
The team said the analysis showed that about 2 percent of the patients had direct contact with wild animals and more than three-quarters were Wuhan residents, had been to Wuhan or had a history of contact with Wuhan residents.
这些发现与其他最新报道一致，包括家庭聚集性疫情、无症状患者传播疾病和分为三个阶段的暴发模式。
The findings are consistent with other recent reports, including a family-focused outbreak, asymptomatic transmission and a three-stage outbreak pattern.
他们认为，该项研究不能排除“超级传播者”的存在。
They said the study could not rule out the existence of "super-disseminators."
在这样研究中，潜伏期定义为接触传染源（野生动物或者疑似或确诊病例）的可能最早日期与出现症状（即咳嗽、发热、乏力或肌痛）的可能最早日期之间的间隔期。
In this study, the incubation period was defined as the period between the earliest possible date of exposure to the source of infection (wild animals or suspected or confirmed cases) and the earliest possible date of onset of symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, weakness or muscle pain).
研究得出的中位潜伏期为4天（四分位距，2-7）。
The median incubation period in the study was 4 days (quartile, 2-7).
患者中位年龄为47岁（四分位距，35-58）；15岁以下的患者占0.9%。
The median age of the patients was 47 years (quartile, 35-58); 0.9 per cent were under 15 years of age.
女性占41.9%。
Women accounted for 41.9 per cent.
入院时43.8%的患者有发热，但住院期间88.7%有发热。
On admission, 43.8 per cent of patients had fever, but 88.7 per cent had fever during hospitalization.
排在其后的最常见症状是咳嗽（67.8%）；恶心或呕吐（5.0%）和腹泻（3.8%）不常见。
Cough (67.8 per cent), nausea or vomiting (5.0 per cent) and diarrhoea (3.8 per cent) were the most common symptoms.
在整个人群中，23.7%有至少一种合并症（如高血压和慢性阻塞性肺疾病）。
In the general population, 23.7 per cent had at least one complication (such as hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
入院时，926例患者的新冠肺炎严重程度被归类为非重症，173例患者被归类为重症。
On admission, 926 patients were classified as non-severe in terms of severity of new crown pneumonia and 173 as severe.
重症患者的年龄比非重症患者大7岁（中位数）。
Patients with severe illness are 7 years older (median) than those who are not.
此外，重症患者有合并症的情况（38.7%）比非重症患者（21.0%）常见。
In addition, complications were more common in severe cases (38.7 per cent) than in non-severe cases (21.0 per cent).
不过，重症患者和非重症患者的暴露史相似。
However, the history of exposure was similar for severe and non-severe patients.
从影像学和实验室检查结果来看，在入院时进行的975次CT扫描中，86.2%有异常结果。
According to imaging and laboratory findings, 86.2 per cent of the 975 CT scans performed at the time of admission had abnormal results.
胸部CT的最常见表现为磨玻璃影（56.4%）和双肺斑片状影（51.8%）。
The most common manifestations of thoracic CT were grinding of glass shadows (56.4 per cent) and double pulmonary plaque (51.8 per cent).
877例非重症患者中的157例（17.9%）和173例重症患者中的5例（2.9%）无影像学或CT异常。
There were no imaging or CT abnormalities in 157 (17.9%) of the 877 non-severe cases and in 5 (2.9%) of the 173 severe cases.
入院时，83.2%的患者有淋巴细胞减少，36.2%有血小板减少，33.7%有白细胞减少。
On admission, 83.2 per cent of patients had lymphocyte loss, 36.2 per cent had thrombocytopenia and 33.7 per cent had leukocytopenia.
大部分患者的C反应蛋白水平升高；丙氨酸转氨酶、天冬氨酸转氨酶、肌酸激酶和d二聚体水平升高的情况较少见。
Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein levels; alanine transaminase, aspartic aminotransferase, creatine kinase and d dimer levels were less common.
与非重症患者相比，重症患者的实验室异常（包括淋巴细胞减少和白细胞减少）更为明显。
Laboratory abnormalities, including lymphocyte depletion and leucocytopenia, are more pronounced in severe patients than in non-severe patients.
研究团队在讨论环节提到，在新冠肺炎疫情初期，患者就诊时症状、影像学结果和疾病严重程度的多样性使疾病诊断变得复杂。
During the discussion, the team noted that in the early stages of Crowne Pneumonia, the diversity of symptoms, imaging findings, and severity of the disease complicated the diagnosis.
值得一提的是，该项研究还发现，重度、非重度组新冠患者各有一例患者的潜伏期达24天。
It is worth noting that the study also found a 24-day latency in one patient with a new crown in both the severe and non-severe groups.
不过，论文的并列第一作者关伟杰、梁文华、何建行教授和钟南山教授在解读时着重提到，仔细查阅整个人群的潜伏期分布规律，发现潜伏期大于14天的共13例（12.7%），而潜伏期大于18天的仅有8例（7.3%）。
However, the co-authors Guan Weijie, Liang Wenhua, He Jianxing and Zhong Nan Shan highlighted in their interpretation the distribution of incubation periods throughout the population, with a total of 13 cases (12.7%) with latency greater than 14 days and only 8 cases (7.3%) with incubation periods greater than 18 days.
他们认为，单纯根据最小、最大值评估人群的潜伏期容易引起误读。
They believe that it is easy to misread people's incubation period based solely on minimum and maximum values.
入院时的呼吸功能受损与结局较差相关新冠肺炎患者的主要复合终点是送入重症监护病房（ICU）、采用机械通气或死亡。
The main compound endpoints for patients with new crown pneumonia with impaired respiratory function and poor outcome on admission were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation or death.
次要终点包括死亡率，从出现症状至发生复合终点的时间，以及从出现症状至发生复合终点中各构成部分的时间。
Secondary endpoints include mortality, the time between the onset of symptoms and the occurrence of a composite endpoint, and the time between the onset of symptoms and the onset of the composite endpoint.
在该项研究中，67例患者（6.1%）发生了主要复合终点事件，包括送入ICU的5.0%、接受有创机械通气的2.3%和死亡的1.4%。
In this study, 67 patients (6.1%) had major combined endpoints, including 5.0% in ICU, 2.3% in invasive mechanical ventilation and 1.4% in death.
173例重症患者中有43例（24.9%）发生了主要复合终点事件。
In 43 (24.9 per cent) of the 173 cases of severe illness, the main compound endpoint event occurred.
在全部患者中，复合终点的累积风险为3.6%；在重症患者中，累积风险为20.6%。
The cumulative risk for combined endpoints was 3.6 per cent for all patients and 20.6 per cent for severe cases.
在治疗方面，大部分患者（58.0%）接受了抗生素静脉用药，35.8%接受了奥司他韦治疗；41.3%接受了吸氧治疗，6.1%接受了机械通气；重症患者接受这些治疗的比例较高。
In terms of treatment, the majority of patients (58.0 per cent) received intravenous antibiotics, 35.8 per cent received oseltamivir treatment, 41.3 per cent received oxygen therapy and 6.1 per cent received mechanical ventilation; patients with severe illnesses received a higher proportion of these treatments.
重症患者接受机械通气的比例高于非重症患者（无创通气，32.4%vs.0%；有创通气，14.5%vs.0%）。
The rate of mechanical ventilation was higher in severe cases than in non-severe patients (non-invasive ventilation, 32.4% vs. 0%; invasive ventilation, 14.5% vs. 0%).
204例患者（18.6%）接受了全身性糖皮质激素治疗，重症患者接受该治疗的比例高于非重症患者（44.5%vs.13.7%）。
A total of 204 patients (18.6%) received systemic glucocorticoid therapy, which was higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases (44.5% vs.13.7%).
在这204例患者中，33例（16.2%）被送入ICU，17例（8.3%）接受了有创通气，5例（2.5%）死亡。
Of these 204 cases, 33 (16.2%) were sent to ICU, 17 (8.3%) received invasive ventilation and 5 (2.5%) died.
5例重症患者（0.5%）接受了体外膜式氧合治疗。
Five patients (0.5%) were treated with membrane oxygen therapy in vitro.
研究显示，中位住院时间为12.0天（均值，12.8）。
The median length of hospitalization was 12.0 days (mean, 12.8).
在住院期间，大部分患者被诊断为肺炎（91.1%），其次是ARDS（3.4%）和休克（1.1%）。
During hospitalization, the majority of patients were diagnosed with pneumonia (91.1%), followed by ARDS (3.4%) and shock (1.1%).
重症患者被诊断为肺炎的比例高于非重症患者（99.4%vs.89.5%）。
Severe cases were diagnosed with pneumonia at a higher rate than non-severe patients (99.4% vs.89.5%).
并发症、治疗和临床终点研究团队提到，尽管与新冠病毒相关的死亡总人数多，但病死率似乎低于SARS-CoV和MERS-CoV。
The Complications, Treatment and Clinical Endpoints Study team notes that while the total number of deaths associated with the new crown virus is high, the fatality rate appears to be lower than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
而患者入院时的呼吸功能受损（疾病严重程度的主要驱动因素）与结局较差相关。
Patients with impaired respiratory function on admission (the main driver of disease severity) were associated with poorer outcomes.
值得注意的是，研究团队在这项研究中确定的病死率为1.4%，低于近期其他团队报道的病死率。
Significantly, the team identified a 1.4 percent fatality rate in the study, lower than the rate reported by other recent teams.
他们认为，原因很可能是样本量和病例纳入标准的差异。
The reason, they argue, may well be the difference between sample sizes and the inclusion of cases.
他们同时认为，由于轻症患者和未就医患者并未纳入本研究，因此真实的病死率可能更低。
They also believe that the true fatality rate is likely to be even lower, since light patients and those who are not treated are not included in the study.
应与SARS、MERS及季节性流感区分开来研究团队在讨论环节指出，SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV和高致病性流感的一般传播途径包括呼吸道飞沫传播和直接接触传播，新冠病毒的传播途径很可能也相同。
Distinguishing SARS, MERS and seasonal influenza The team discussed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and common transmission routes of highly pathogenic influenza include respiratory droplet transmission and direct contact, and that the transmission of the new crown virus is likely to be the same.
但目前已在胃肠道、唾液和尿液内检出新冠病毒，因此需要对这些潜在传播途径进行研究。
However, the new crown virus has been detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva and urine, so these potential transmission pathways need to be studied.
他们认为，与近期其他研究的结果一致，研究团队发现新冠肺炎的临床特征与SARS-CoV相似。
Consistent with other recent studies, the team found clinical features similar to those of SARS-CoV, they said.
发热和咳嗽是主要症状，胃肠道症状不常见，因此提示与SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV和季节性流感相比，新冠病毒具有不同的趋向性。
Fever and cough are the main symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon, suggesting that the new crown virus has different tendencies compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and seasonal influenza.
不发热的新冠肺炎患者比例高于SARS-CoV（1%）和MERS-CoV（2%）感染患者，因此如果监测病例的定义侧重于检测发热，则不发热的患者可能会被漏诊。
The proportion of patients with non-febrile pneumonia is higher than that of patients with SARS-CoV (1 per cent) and MERS-CoV (2 per cent), so if the definition of surveillance cases focuses on detection of fever, non-febrile patients may be missed.
淋巴细胞减少常见，而且某些病例达到重度减少。
Lymphocyte reductions are common and in some cases severe.
研究团队还强调，尽管新冠病毒和SARS-CoV具有种属相似性，但一些临床特征可以将新冠肺炎与SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV及季节性流感区分开来。
The team also stressed that despite the genetic similarity between the new crown virus and SARS-CoV, some clinical features distinguish it from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and seasonal influenza.
研究团队同时提到，研究还存在一些明显的局限性，包括部分病例的接触史和实验室检查记录不完整、非专科医院存在基础设施缺乏和医务人员培训不足、只能估算本研究中有记录信息的291例患者的潜伏期、许多患者仍在住院，数据截止时结局未知等。
The team also noted a number of significant limitations to the study, including incomplete exposure histories and laboratory records for some cases, lack of infrastructure and inadequate training of medical staff in non-specialist hospitals, the incubation period for 291 patients for whom information was available in the present study, the fact that many patients were still hospitalized and the outcome unknown at the time of the data cut-off.
他们在局限性中还强调了一点，“我们无疑遗漏了无症状或居家治疗的轻症患者，因此我们的研究队列可能代表了新冠肺炎比较严重的一面。
Among their limitations, they also stress that "we've undoubtedly missed asymptomatic or home-based light cases, so our study cohort may represent the more serious side of New Crown Pneumonia.
