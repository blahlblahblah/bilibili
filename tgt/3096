燃财经（ID:rancaijing）原创作者 | 孟亚娜编辑 | 周昶帆全国各地公立学校自2月10日起陆续开始在线上课，300多个城市的60多万名教师摇身一变，成为了主播。
Flaming Finance (ID: Rancaijing) Former founder and founder of Meng Raijina, the country's public schools have been running online since February 10, with more than 600,000 teachers in more than 300 cities becoming anchor teachers.
初次接触在线教学，部分老师一时手足无措，成为了网络段子的主角，乱象众生。
First contact with online teaching, some teachers are at a loss to become the protagonist of the network segment, chaos like sentient beings.
为响应停课不停学政策，几家头部在线教育机构纷纷面向全国中小学生捐出免费的公益课程。
In response to the non-stop learning policy, several online head-to-head educational institutions donated free pro bono courses to primary and secondary school students across the country.
与此同时，一场没有硝烟的流量争夺战也悄然爆发。
At the same time, a smoke-free flow battle broke out quietly.
而此次疫情下，受冲击较大的线下培训机构，则选择闭店观望或紧急将课程搬运到线上，祈祷能活着渡过难关。
And this epidemic, the impact of the larger offline training institutions, then choose to close shop wait-and-see or urgent transport courses to the line, pray can survive the difficulties.
一些教育机构则因为激进扩张、现金流断裂，不幸夭折，老牌IT培训机构兄弟连宣布破产，明兮大语文资金链断裂停业倒闭。
Some educational institutions went bankrupt because of radical expansion, broken cash flow and the collapse of an established IT training institution's brother company.
在二级市场，大量流量的涌入、对线上教育的需求激增，让在线教育受到了资本的青睐。
In the secondary market, the influx of mass traffic, the demand for online education surged, so that online education has been favored by capital.
A股开市的前几日，在线教育股连续多日涨停，在美股和港股市场上，新东方在线、好未来、跟谁学、网易有道等在线教育概念股涨势也十分凶猛。
A share opened a few days ago, online education stocks have been trading a number of days in a row, shares in the United States and Hong Kong shares, New Oriental Online, a good future, with whom to learn, Netease and other online education concept shares rose very fierce.
这场疫情，提升了社会对在线教育的认知，同时，也推动着在线教育加速狂奔。
The epidemic has raised social awareness of online education and accelerated online education.
流量洪峰下基础设施和师资紧急扩容1月22日开始，为教育机构提供在线教室直播系统的ClassIn后台注册机构开始暴增，最高的时候一天之内登录学生人次超过160万，同时在线的学生人数超过了35万。
Starting on 22 January, the Classin back-office registry, which provides an online classroom direct broadcasting system for educational institutions, began a surge, with more than 1.6 million students enrolled in a single day and more than 350,000 students online at the same time.
相比平时的学习高峰期，用户数又突然翻了近10倍。
Compared to the normal peak of learning, the number of users suddenly increased almost tenfold.
“一开始我们最优的选择是扩容到3-5倍，但随着用户的增多，又扩到10倍，再到后来的30倍，现在已经达到百万级别。
"Our best option at first was to expand it three to five times, but as the number of users grew, it expanded tenfold to 30 times, and now it has reached a million levels.
”ClassIn联合创始人谷岩告诉燃财经。
KrasIn co-founder Gu Yan told Flaming Finance.
和ClassIn一样，在中小学开学日当天，几乎所有承载网课的服务平台都出现了大面积的卡顿和延迟等问题。
As with Classin, almost all the service platforms that host online classes have problems with large areas of katton and latency on the opening day of primary and secondary school.
猿辅导在其微博上发布，开课首日平台当日共涌入500万用户，导致网络拥挤、卡顿，团队紧急修复。
The ape counseling program was posted on its microblog, and the influx of 5 million users on the first day of classes led to congestion, katton and emergency repairs.
为教育机构提供平台的钉钉、腾讯等多款软件也出现卡顿、崩掉的状态。
To provide a platform for educational institutions nail, Tencent and other software types also appear Catton, collapse of the state.
面对短期内激增的学生数量，各家平台纷纷进行紧急扩容。
Faced with a surge in student numbers in the short term, various platforms have been emergency expansion.
谷岩向燃财经解释道，一般来说平台不会盲目扩容，需要技术储备提前做好来帮助平台达到更高的目标。
Gu Yan explains to combustible finance, generally platform won't blindly expand capacity, need technical reserve to do well in advance to help platform achieve higher goal.
除了带宽问题外，平台在扩容时还需要有稳定的底层软件架构以及物理资源服务器支撑。
In addition to bandwidth problems, the platform needs a stable underlying software architecture and physical resource server support when it is expanded.
一方面，在这段时间，带宽资源比较紧张，除了在线教育平台外，一些会议视频软件平台也需要大量的带宽。
On the one hand, bandwidth resources are tight during this period. In addition to the online education platform, some conference video software platforms also need a lot of bandwidth.
另一方面，春节期间商业基本处于半瘫痪状态，一些物理资源较难在短时间买到。
On the other hand, business during the Spring Festival is basically in a semi-paralyzed state, some physical resources are more difficult to buy in a short time.
ClassIn在寒假前期网络稳定性受到了考验。
Classin's network stability was tested in the early winter vacation.
按常理来说，平台的网上资源、云服务器、带宽等都是需要经过两个星期左右的调试才能上线的，但这段时间完全是“一边开飞机一边修发动机”的状态。
As a rule, the platform's online resources, cloud servers, bandwidth, and so on take about two weeks to go online, but this time is "flying while fixing the engine."
“很多人开玩笑说我们属于疫情股，大家看到的是我们用户数量的上涨，然而我们做这件事情，投入也非常大。
"A lot of people joke that we belong to the epidemic unit and we're seeing an increase in the number of our users, and yet we're doing this with a lot of commitment.
“谷岩说。
"said Google.
ClassIn还没来得及算这笔账，在决定要继续扩容的时候，根本没有任何时间去算账。
ClassIn had not had time to calculate the bill, and had no time at all to settle it when he decided to proceed with the expansion.
一些头部平台的紧急投入均超过了千万元级别。
Emergency inputs for some head platforms are in excess of $10 million.
猿辅导副总裁李鑫近日在接受采访时表示，因为提供免费直播课，这个月带宽费用将超过一亿，已经买空了市场上能买到的所有资源，如果数据继续上涨，只能求助工信部了。
Li Xin, vice-president of ape counseling, said in an interview that the cost of bandwidth this month would exceed 100 million because of the free live broadcast classes. All the resources available in the market have been sold out.
平台的基础设施问题解决之后，师资力量又凸显出来，成了一大问题。
After the platform's infrastructure problem is solved, the teacher's strength comes out again, became a big problem.
大量用户短时间内的涌入，让平台在师资方面也承受了很大的压力，多家线上教育机构告诉燃财经，最近一个月以来，几乎所有的教师都是007的状态。
The influx of a large number of users in a short period of time has also put a lot of pressure on the platform's teaching staff, with online educational institutions telling Burning Finance that almost all teachers in the past month have been 007.
一家K12在线教育平台百分课堂，近日与杭州萧山区中小学合作，提供了平台、师资和内容全套服务。
A K12 online education platform 100-point classroom, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan primary and secondary schools recently, providing a platform, teachers and a complete set of services.
“这次捐课的活动，短期内为百分课堂带来了10万用户，已经达到了平台承压的极限，而且对于老师们授课也是一场考验。
"The donation, which has brought 100,000 users to 100 000 classrooms in a short period of time, has stretched the limits of the platform and is a test of how teachers teach.
”百分课堂COO王彦飞告诉燃财经。
COO Yan-fei told Flaming Finance.
相比之下，线下教育机构更为艰难，从未接触过在线教学的教师，转身变成了主播，引起了各种不适。
In contrast, offline educational institutions are more difficult, with teachers who have never been exposed to online instruction turning around and becoming anchor teachers, causing all sorts of discomfort.
缺乏直播设备，拿衣架做了简易版本的手机架；不熟悉直播软件，将美颜开到最大功能，还在直播中间被家人打断人设崩塌；网课平台拥挤，老师自己没挤进去；全程忘记开麦，静音讲完了一堂课全然无知，近期网课大型翻车现场频上热搜。
Without live equipment, the hanger made a simple version of the mobile phone rack; not familiar with live broadcast software to maximize beauty, but also interrupted by family members in the middle of the collapse; the network classes platform crowded, the teacher himself did not squeeze in; the entire course forgot to open the wheat, silent speech completely ignorant, the recent Internet classes on the scene of large overturning hot search.
从形式上看，各K12类在线教育公司捐赠的课程大多都是在线大班直播课，并无明显差异，而大班直播课目前也是业内公认的抗风险较高的模式，因为可以利用大班直播课没有边界的特性，同时覆盖更多的用户。
Formally, most of the courses donated by K-12 online educational companies are online, with no significant difference, and large-class live classes are now recognized as high-risk models in the industry, as they can take advantage of the borderless nature of large-scale live classes and reach more users.
在爱学习创始人须佶成看来，多数家长会比较认可名师效应，但好的老师非常少。
Having a legible legibility of love-learning founders, most parents are more likely to recognize the celebrity teacher effect, but few good teachers.
但另一方面，相比于小班课和1V1教学来说，大班课非常考验教师的控场能力，以及应对不同层次用户的应变能力。
But on the other hand, compared to small classes and 1 V1 teaching, large class is a great test of teachers' ability to control the field, as well as to cope with different levels of user response.
因此，优秀师资仍旧是各机构间吸引用户的核心竞争力。
As a result, high-quality teachers remain the core competitiveness of institutions in attracting users.
图 / Pexels在线教育的细分领域中，K12学科辅导是个比较复杂的市场。
In the field of online education, K12 tutoring is a more complex market.
因为全国不同地区的教材版本、难度、进度和考试题型都有很大的差异，而这些差异也导致了K12学科类产品无法只用一个体系标准化研发。
Because the versions, difficulties, progress, and test types of textbooks vary widely in different parts of the country, these differences also make it impossible to standardize K12 products in a single system.
为了解决这个问题，多数机构采用了教材分层的方式，在学生报名时就给予区分，比如北师大版、人教版、沪教版等。
In order to solve this problem, most institutions have adopted a hierarchical approach to teaching materials, distinguishing among students when they register, such as the Beijing Normal University edition, the humanities edition and the Shanghai teaching edition.
网易有道副总裁罗媛告诉燃财经，随着用户群体从一二线城市覆盖到全国，网易有道就采用了分层教学模式和对辅导老师区域化管理两种方式。
Luo Yuan, vice president of Netease Co., told Burning Finance that as user groups moved from first-tier to second-tier cities across the country, Netease adopted a layered approach to teaching and regionalized management of tutors.
而随着更多不同地区用户的涌入，师资的需求也随之迅速加大。
With the influx of more users from different regions, the demand for teachers has increased rapidly.
这次免费直播课看似给各在线教育机构带来了可观的用户数量，但不同于纯互联网产品，家长和学生选择一个教育产品的时候，往往更多是看重教学质量和口碑。
This free live course seems to have brought a significant number of users to online educational institutions, but unlike pure Internet products, parents and students tend to value quality and word of mouth more when choosing an educational product.
因此，免费课对于多数在线教育机构而言，更多只是一个公益行为，实际学生到课率并不高。
As a result, free classes are more of a public good for most online educational institutions, and student-to-class attendance is not high.
“对于在线教育而言，到最后真正比拼的还是内容和口碑。
"For online education, what really matters is content and word-of-mouth.
不管现在所谓的在线教育有多热，必须得把握好内容。
No matter how hot online education is these days, you have to get it right.
”罗媛说。
'said Luo Yuan.
免费课不如低价课程受欢迎面对疫情，多数教育机构都通过免费捐课、捐资金物资的方式贡献一份力。
Free classes are not as popular as low-cost courses Faced with the epidemic, most educational institutions contribute by donating money and materials free of charge.
学而思网校、新东方、跟谁学、爱学习、猿辅导等机构纷纷推出免费公益直播课。
Learning for the Net, New Oriental, with whom to learn, love to learn, ape counseling and other institutions have launched free broadcast pro bono classes.
近日，在B站学习节的网易有道公开课上，一位化学老师拆掉儿子两个玩具，为学生们实操如何自制84消毒液，一位地理老师则举起脸盆，讲着地形图，另一位生物老师cos起了蝙蝠，栩栩如生讲述病毒的10086种小心机……为了引发学生的上课兴趣，这几位老师，时而严肃时而活泼，煞费苦心。
One geography teacher held up a basin and told a topographic map. Another biology teacher, Cos, raised a bat to tell students about the 100086 carefully crafted machines to arouse students' interest in the class.
从课程设置上看，各机构之间各出奇新，试图用不一样的课程方式来吸引用户的眼球。
From the curriculum, the institutions are different from each other, trying to use different courses to attract the attention of users.
有道精品课在B站开启定制课程内容直播；学而思网校请来朗朗做公开课；猿辅导则请来了《百家讲坛》主持人纪连海、北师大教授康震、著名作家刘墉等各领域名师开启了公益讲堂。
In addition, Lang Lang has been invited to take part in the public lecture. He has invited Ji Lianhai, Professor Kang Zhen, a professor from Beijing Normal University, and the renowned writer Jim Yong Liu to open the public lecture hall.
但无论各机构推出什么样的内容，用户需求最多的毫无疑问仍然是K12类课程。
But no matter what kind of content is launched by organizations, there is no doubt that K12 courses remain the most sought after by users.
各家机构通过免费赠送公开课的方式，为全国学生解决了线上学习的问题，也进一步建立更多学生和家长对在线教育的认知。
Through free public classes, institutions have solved the problem of online learning for students across the country and have further developed the awareness of students and parents about online education.
跟谁学创始人陈向东说，对于一些没有接触过在线教育的家长而言，停课不停学促进了他们参与到线上教学中来，但对于那些对在线教育原本就有需求的用户而言，免费课却不如低价课更受欢迎。
For parents who do not have access to online education, the absence of classes encourages them to participate in online teaching, but free classes are less popular than low-cost classes for those who already have a need for online education, said Chen Dongdong, founder of the program.
据学而思官网、作业帮和猿辅导官网客服提示，此次免费课程是特殊时期为孩子们提供的福利，和春季课程的区别是课程缺少针对性辅导和服务。
The free course is a boon for children in special times, and the difference between the spring course and the lack of targeted tutoring and services, according to HOPE, Homework and Apes Mentors.
相比之下，低价课程则是将课程和服务浓缩打包为一体的体验课程，通常为一套课程中的前几节。
Low-cost courses, by contrast, are experience courses that condense courses and services into one package, usually the first few sections of a set of courses.
罗媛告诉燃财经，免费课程是家长建立对在线教育从0到1认知过程中非常重要的一环。
Luo told Burning Finance that free classes were an important part of parents' efforts to build awareness of online education from 0 to 1.
一个用户通常真正从知道到使用，需要经过很多步骤，从知晓到购买中间还需要有一个很大的跨度，而免费课就能低门槛地建立家长的信任，质量好不好，要不要继续买更多的课程和服务，通过免费体验课家长就能做出自己的判断。
It takes a lot of steps for a user to really get from knowing to using, from knowing to buying, and free lessons can build trust and quality of parents at a low threshold. If they want to continue buying more courses and services, parents will be able to make their own judgments through free experience classes.
陈向东在2月19日跟谁学2019年财年Q4财报电话会上算了一笔账。
Chen Dongdong in February 19 with whom to learn 2019 fiscal year Q4 financial report telephone conference to calculate an account.
中国大约有2亿中小学生，假设将一名小学生从离线运行到在线运行的成本大约为1000元，乘以得出的总成本为人民币2000亿元。
There are about 200 million primary and secondary school students in China, assuming that the cost of running a primary school from offline to online operation is about 1,000 yuan, multiplied by the total cost of 200 billion yuan.
同时来自中小学和课后辅导机构的教师近2000万。
There are also nearly 20 million teachers from primary and secondary schools and after-school guidance institutions.
假设在线培训一名教师的成本为200元，总共成本是400亿元。
Suppose the cost of training a teacher online is $200, for a total cost of $40 billion.
简而言之，疫情为在线教育行业节省了将近2400亿元的促销费用。
In short, the epidemic has saved the online education industry nearly $240 billion in promotional costs.
财报电话会中也披露道，免费捐课期间，跟谁学平台吸引了近1500万注册用户。
During the free donation, nearly 15 million people signed up to learn from the platform, the newspaper reported.
然而，陈向东却表示，用户数量不等于客户数量，虽然吸引客户可以很快，但积累忠实客户需要更长的时间。
However, Chen Dongdong said the number of users does not equal the number of customers, although attracting customers can be quick, but it takes longer to accumulate loyal customers.
他分析道，一个用户注册了三个免费的实时班级，然后他决定是否参加低价促销课程。
He analyses that a user signs up for three free real-time classes and then decides whether to take a low-cost promotion course.
由于此过程比直接从人民币9元的实时课程转换要多一步，因此转换率肯定要低得多。
Since this process is one step more than a real-time conversion from RMB 9 to RMB, the conversion rate is certainly much lower.
另外，对于用户来说，由于学习是不可逆的，试错成本也相对较高，学生大多不会选择太多时间去尝试不同的平台。
In addition, since learning is irreversible and trial-and-error costs are relatively high for users, most students do not choose to spend much time trying different platforms.
寒假期间，网易有道通过用户调研，发现多数初高中生的寒假已经被学校布置了满满的任务，他们的时间并没有很充裕。
During the winter vacation, Netease found through user research that most junior and senior high school students have been full of tasks, their time is not very adequate.
相比之下，低价付费课则更能被家长所接受，用户在单位时间内对低价课满意度非常高。
By contrast, low-cost classes are more acceptable to parents, and users are very satisfied with low-cost classes per unit of time.
罗媛分析其核心原因是，家长和学生真正需要的是短期高效的课程，单位时间内浓缩了课程精华，这样用户体验会比较好。
Luo's analysis is that what parents and students really need is short, high-impact courses that condense the essence of the curriculum per unit of time so that the user experience is better.
图 / Pexels事实上，对于线下机构和用户而言，在线教育并不陌生。
Figure / Pexels In fact, online education is no stranger to offline institutions and users.
艾瑞咨询数据显示，2019年中国在线教育市场规模预计达到3133.6亿元，同比增长24.5%，用户对在线教育的接受程度正在不断提升，在线付费意识逐渐养成以及线上学习体验和效果的提升是在线教育市场规模持续增长的主要原因。
In 2019, China's online education market is expected to reach 313.36 billion yuan, a 24.5% year-on-year increase, according to Ir consulting data. User acceptance of online education is growing, and the growing awareness of online payment and the rise in online learning experience and outcomes are the main reasons for the continued growth of online education market.
但不可否认，这次疫情对在线教育的渗透力有极大的提高，此次停课不停学的政策之下，全国各地的学生涌入线上平台，下沉市场的圈层很容易地被突破了。
But there is no denying that the epidemic has greatly increased the penetration of online education, with students from all over the country pouring into online platforms under the policy of non-stop learning, and the loops of the sinking market are easily broken.
以往来说，各家在线教育机构都会先选择搞定一二线城市，再往下沉市场突破。
In the past, each online educational institution will first choose to complete a second-tier city, and then to break through the sinking market.
而这次疫情期间，下沉市场意外被打通。
During the outbreak, the sinking market was accidentally opened.
谷岩观察到，一些线下机构的转型，速度要比想象中快很多。
Valley observed that some of the offline mechanisms were transitioning much faster than expected.
她发现在ClassIn平台上，一些线下机构的教师，对平台的工具应用速度出奇地快。
She found that on the ClassIn platform, some teachers of offline organizations were surprisingly quick to use the platform's tools.
在上课的时候，老师和学生在平台的黑板上同步进行书写沟通，学习更加高效。
In class, teachers and students in the platform on the blackboard synchronous written communication, more efficient learning.
这次疫情推动了线下教育机构尝试在线教学的动力，加速了线上和线下教学的融合。
The epidemic has spurred offline educational institutions to experiment with online learning, accelerating the integration of online and offline teaching.
但现阶段，线下培训机构仍然是教育机构中受冲击最大的。
At this stage, however, offline training institutions continue to be the hardest hit by educational institutions.
他们不仅要面临着房租压力，还有老师学生上课难的问题，老师的招聘和培训都无法按照原有速度进行，各在线教育机构巨头们开放免费课程，对于线下机构也是一种冲击。
Not only do they face rent pressures, but also the difficulty of teaching students, hiring and training teachers cannot proceed at the same pace, and the free courses offered by online education giants are a shock to offline institutions.
在罗媛看来，疫情对在线教育发展是一把双刃剑，大家会在体验线上课程的同时发现一些缺点，比如网课翻车，这也会促使缺点暴露得更加彻底，家长的选择更加理性。
According to Luo, the epidemic is a double-edged sword for online education, and some shortcomings, such as the rollover of online classes, will help expose shortcomings more thoroughly and make parents' choices more rational.
对于一些专注做内容和服务的公司来说，才有可能会成为一个发展的节点。
For companies that focus on content and services, it is possible to become a growth node.
谷岩也认为，从次疫情是未来两三年在线教育发展的预演。
Gu Yan also believes that from the sub-epidemic is the next two to three years online education development rehearsal.
疫情之后，对于第三方教育平台机构来说留下的是新增的用户数量，而留给机构的则是在线教育模式的认知，所有人面临的机会和挑战都是并存的。
In the aftermath of the epidemic, the number of new users was left to third-party education platform institutions, while institutions were left with knowledge of the online education model, in which opportunities and challenges for all coexisted.
“过去在全国整个教育市场中，大部分家长还是对家庭教育比较陌生的，愿意去主动尝试在线教育的家长可能只有20%，但我预测接下来这个比例会提升到50%。
"In the past, most parents in the entire education market were unfamiliar with family education. Only 20 percent of parents were willing to take the initiative to try online education, but I predict that proportion will rise to 50 percent next.
”核桃编程创始人曾鹏轩告诉燃财经，这次短期来说其实对于在线教育利好并不大，随着客户和市场被教育，会有一个长期的效应。
Zeng Pengxuan, founder of walnut programming, told Flaming Finance that the short-term benefits for online education were modest, with a long-term effect as customers and markets were educated.
爱学习创始人须佶成则认为，目前阶段只是加速了线下教育和线上教育的融合。
Those who love learning must suffer a lot and believe that the current stage has only accelerated the integration of offline and online education.
“就像非典之后，虽然电商崛起了，但也并未完全替代线下消费行为，教育也是如此。
"Just as in the wake of SARS, the rise of e-commerce has not completely replaced offline consumer behaviour, nor has education.
