上海确诊101例新冠肺炎，远超SARS，精细化排查仍是最有效防控。
Shanghai confirmed 101 cases of new crown pneumonia, far more than SARS, fine screening is still the most effective control.

八点健闻                      。
Eight good news.
八点健闻。
Eight good news.
看得懂的健康专业新闻。
Understandable health professional news.
2003年上海仅有8人感染SARS，而本次疫情短短10天已有101人确诊。
Only 8 people were infected with SARS in Shanghai in 2003, compared with 101 cases in just 10 days.
17年前的经验，这回还有没有用？上海的疫情防控有三张网：道口和口岸；发热门诊跟预检分诊；社区。
Is the experience of 17 years ago still useful this time? Shanghai has three networks for epidemic prevention and control: crossings and ports; fever clinics and pre-screening; and the community.
医生、警察、居民三人小组对所有湖北返沪人员进行排查，警察进行看管和告知，医生掌握身体状况，居民提供生活保障。
Doctors, police and residents of all the three groups returned to Shanghai personnel screening, police custody and information, doctors in control of the physical condition, residents provide livelihood security.
隔离区讲规则，也有温情，家长在隔离，6岁儿童看病，都由值班医护接送。
ZOS rules, there is also tenderness, parents in isolation, 6-year-old children see a doctor, all by on-duty medical care.
SARS之后，上海建立专门用于收治突发疫情患者的上海公卫中心，本次作为定点医院显得游刃有余。
After SARS, Shanghai set up a public health center dedicated to treating patients with sudden outbreaks.
2003年的SARS持续7个月，当时常住人口1700万的上海仅有8人感染。
The SARS epidemic lasted seven months in 2003, when only eight people in Shanghai, with a population of 17 million, were infected.
而这次的新型冠状病毒肺炎，上海1月20日公布首例输入型确诊病例以来，短短10天，已确诊101例。
Since Shanghai announced its first confirmed case of coronavirus on January 20, 101 cases have been confirmed in just 10 days.
上海常住人口已经飙升至2500万，17年前的经验，这回还有没有用？从全国范围来看，也是在这10天时间里，新型冠状病毒肺炎的确诊数也已超过SARS，当时中国内地共5327人感染，死亡349人。
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia nationwide also exceeded SARS in the past 10 days, when 5327 people were infected and 349 people died in mainland China.
而截至1月29日24时，中国内地累计报告新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊病例7711例，死亡170例。
As of 2400 hours on January 29, China has reported 7711 confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia and 170 deaths.
在上海目前的101例病例（截至29日24时）中，48例都是来自湖北武汉及其省内各地。
Of the 101 cases reported in Shanghai (as of 2400 hours on the 29th), 48 were from Wuhan, Hubei province.
通过人传人，又在上海出现了近一半的本地病例。
Through human-to-human transmission, nearly half of all local cases occur in Shanghai.
截至目前，虽与浙江、广东的确诊数相比，上海还不算靠前，但也已是SARS时期确诊人数的12倍多。
So far, although compared with the number of confirmed cases in Zhejiang and Guangdong, Shanghai is not advanced, but it is more than 12 times the number of people diagnosed during the SARS period.
其中的原因，一则是人口流动的速度和数量已远远超过2003年，二则是武汉封城之前又有很多人仓促投奔上海而来。
The reason for this is that the speed and quantity of population movement has been far greater than in 2003, on the other hand, Wuhan before the closure of the city before a lot of people rushed to Shanghai.
就在首例确诊之后，上海就宣布成立全市层面针对此次输入性疫情的防控工作领导小组，此后迅速形成卫健、公安、农业农村、交通运输、市场监管、民航、铁路、区域信息等部门的联防联控，触达之迅疾，波及之广泛，超过了17年前的SARS之时。
Immediately after the first case was diagnosed, Shanghai announced the setting up of a city-wide leading group for the prevention and control of the imported epidemic. Since then, the joint control of health, public security, agricultural and rural areas, transportation, market supervision, civil aviation, railways and regional information has reached epidemic proportions beyond the 17-year-old SARS epidemic.
不为人所知的，更有无数基层防控人员一遍遍的“地毯式”排查行动。
Unknown, there are countless grass-roots control personnel over and over again "blanket" screening operations.
上海之“精细化”城市管理风格被体现得淋漓尽致。
Shanghai's "refined" urban management style is reflected incisively and vividly.
△原本车水马龙的陆家嘴此刻空荡荡的，刘冉摄“地毯式”排查：最原始最有效的办法给顾青（化名）打电话的时候，是午休时间，只听他吸溜了一口泡面，说等会儿。
Originally, Lu Jiazui is empty at the moment, Liu Ran She "blanket" inventory: the most original and effective way to call Gu Qing (alias), is lunch break, only to listen to him suck bubble face, said a moment.
他是上海某区街道办的负责人，大年三十吃完年夜饭，收到排查命令之后，就一直没回过家。
He is the head of a street office in Shanghai, after the New Year's Eve dinner, received the clearance order, has not returned home.
几乎每天都是早上七点开始工作，晚上就睡办公室。
Work starts almost every day at seven in the morning and sleeps in the office at night.
一等就到了晚上才说上话，顾青说，排查工作，说难也不难，“就是掌握哪些人去过湖北，或和湖北人有密切接触。
It is not difficult to find out who has been to Hubei or has close contact with Hubei people.
”第一轮排查对象是区公安局给的几百人名单。
The first round consisted of lists of hundreds of people given by the district police.
“虽然是湖北籍，但没离开过上海，这种就排除。
"Although Hubei nationality, but has not left Shanghai, this kind of exclusion.
”一旦确认有旅行史或接触史，疾控中心的工作人员会上门测体温，做好详细登记。
Once a travel history or exposure history is confirmed, CDC staff take a temperature check at the door and keep a detailed register.
有住处的，居家观察；没有住处的，劝说他们集中到一个地方进行观察（每个区都有医学观察点）。
someone who has a place to live, a home to watch; someone who has no place to live, persuade them to gather in one place for observation (each district has a medical observation point).
“告诉他们，14天不要出门，如果没有症状是属于安全的，如果有症状马上和居委会联系。
"Tell them not to go out for 14 days, if no symptoms are safe, contact your neighborhood immediately if you have symptoms.
一天两次，报告他们的体温。
Twice a day, report their temperature.
”1月26日晚，武汉市长周先旺在新闻发布会上表示，因为春节和疫情的影响，目前有500多万人离开武汉。
More than five million people have left Wuhan on the evening of January 26 because of the Spring Festival and the outbreak, Wuhan, Wuhan city's top minister, said at a news conference.
其中，至少有超过8万人来沪。
At least 80,000 of them came to Shanghai.
这里面就包含，封城之前，开着私家车来沪人员。
This includes, before the closure of the city, driving private cars to Shanghai personnel.
顾青说，这批人的信息，在第一轮排查中掌握不到。
Gu Qing said that this group of people's information, in the first round of inventory do not know.
第二轮“地毯式”排查，就是挨家挨户走访。
The second round of "blanket" searches involves house-to-house visits.
“这一轮排查任务比较重，从大年初二早晨8:30开始，到晚上七八点，将近12个小时，把辖区内将近2万户排查出来。
"This round of checks is heavy, from 8: 30 a.m. on the second day of the New Year, to 7 or 8 p.m., nearly 12 hours, the jurisdiction of nearly 20,000 out.
”偶尔也有吃闭门羹的时候。
"Occasionally I'd close my door.
“比如说，你敲开门，但人家马上说你离我远一点。
"For example, you knock on the door, but people immediately say you stay away from me.
有的湖北过来的，不太愿意被查，可能门都不给你开。
Some Hubei to come, do not want to be investigated, may not open the door for you.
碰到这种情况，卫生服务中心、派出所同志，会一起做工作，得再去一趟，再去劝服。
This situation, health service centres, police station comrades, will work together, have to go again, and then to persuade.
”也会有居民主动打电话到居委会，或者通过12345电话来反映，附近有从武汉那边回来的人员。
Residents will also call neighborhood committees on their own initiative, or by calling 12,345 to report that there are people from Wuhan nearby.
顾青再发动人去找。
Gu Qing then launched a search.
△公交车站宣传栏贴的告示，刘冉摄排查完2万户之后，顾青的工作并没有轻松起来。
The notice posted on the notice board of bus station "??" said that after Liu Ran-ping and checking 20,000 households, Gu's work was not relaxed.
初六开始，会有大量的返沪人员，对于基层防控人员来说，将会是新一轮的挑战。
The beginning of the sixth day, there will be a large number of returnees to Shanghai, grass-roots prevention and control personnel, will be a new round of challenges.
顾青认为，后面的任务会更重，之前两轮排查，对这个小区有多少人，相对清楚。
Gu Qing believes that the task will be heavier, before the two rounds of screening, on the number of people in this community, relatively clear.
“后面回来的基本上都是外来务工人员，这些人的情况其实我们是不掌握的，那么要一家一家核实。
"The people who come back are basically migrant workers, but we don't have the information, so we have to check it out one by one.
”因此，初三开始，顾青又开始第三轮的排查，主要针对单位、商务楼、工地、饭店等。
Therefore, the beginning of the third day of junior high school, Gu Qing began a third round of inventory, mainly for units, business buildings, construction sites, restaurants.
顾青只是众多基层防控人员中的一个写照，就像螺丝钉，看上去细枝末节，却是整个防控工作中最为关键的一环。
Gu Qing is just one of the many grass-roots prevention and control personnel, like screws, it seems to be a minor, but the most crucial part of the control work.
1月28日，国家卫健委高级别专家组组长钟南山接受新华社采访时说，“应对疫情要抓住两个要害，一个是早发现，一个就是早隔离。
"There are two keys to fighting the epidemic, one is early detection and the other is early quarantine," Zhong Nan-shan, leader of the high-level group of health experts, told Xinhua on January 28.
这两条是最原始，也是最有效的办法。
These are the two most primitive and effective approaches.
”三道防控网，精细化管理一位上海官员已经连轴转了11天10夜，他对八点健闻说，SARS给上海提供了很多实战的预案，令这次应对新冠肺炎更从容。
"SARS has provided Shanghai with many real-life plans, making it easier to deal with the new crown pneumonia," a Shanghai official said after 11 days and 10 nights on the move.
上海的疫情防控，有三张网。
Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control, there are three nets.
第一张是道口和口岸。
The first is the crossing and the port.
配备了警察、医生、辅警6人小组，对可能有输入风险的人群进行体温检测。
A team of six police officers, doctors and auxiliaries were deployed to take temperature tests on people who might be at risk of importation.
体温正常的，引导到集中的隔离观察点，进行医学观察；体温异常的，就近送往发热门诊。
Normal body temperature, leading to a centralized isolation observation point, for medical observation; abnormal temperature, the nearest to the fever clinic.
第二张，是发热门诊跟预检分诊，第一时刻把发热病人跟正常病人进行区分，减少传播路径。
The second is a fever clinic and pre-screening, the first time with fever patients and normal patients to distinguish, reduce the transmission path.
第三张，就是社区。
The third one is the community.
以闵行区为例，实行了医警居三人小组，一个医生，一个警察，一个居民，对所有湖北地区来的人进行排查。
Taking Minhang District as an example, a medical police three-person team, a doctor, a policeman, a resident, were carried out to check all the people from Hubei area.
全区成立了578个这样的小组，已经发现了2000多个湖北籍的返沪人员。
The region has set up 578 such groups and has found more than 2,000 Hubei people returning to Shanghai.
三人小组是闵行区特有的一个预案。
Triple group is a special plan in Minhang district.
警察要对重点观察人员进行看管和告知，让他承诺14天不出门；但他的身体状况、体温情况掌握，由医生来做；对他生活的保障，及其他一些比较杂的事务处理，由社区来做。
The police supervised and informed the key observer that he would remain in the house for 14 days; however, his physical condition and temperature were under the control of a doctor; his living security and other more complex matters were handled by the community.
此外，每个街镇都预备了1～2个集中的医学观察点。
In addition, one or two centralized medical observation points have been prepared in every street town.
来监测，在道口、口岸、宾馆，发现的有发热、可疑接触史人群。
To monitor, in the crossing, port, guesthouse, found with fever, suspicious contact history of the population.
闵行区预备了14个医学观察点，准备了将近800张床位。
Minhang District prepared 14 medical observation points and nearly 800 beds.
而这些工作总结起来，可以概述为三步，第一、找人或者找源；第二、隔离；第三、治疗。
These efforts can be summed up as three steps, first, to find people or find sources; second, isolation; and third, treatment.
一位上海社区工作人员表示，“我们把这三步坐实了，把人先找到，人找不到，就是个潜在的传染源。
"We sat down on these three steps, found people first, people can not find, is a potential source of infection," said a Shanghai community worker.
找到人以后，隔离一定做到位。
When you find someone, you must isolate it.
期间有异常的状况，积极救治。
During the abnormal conditions, active treatment.
上海主要抓住了三个核心。
Shanghai has focused on three core issues.
”严防死守之下，闵行区的确诊病例目前是2名。
The confirmed cases in Minhang district are currently two under strict guard.
但在一位负责人看来，病例多少，并不代表防控效果。
But in the opinion of one person in charge, the number of cases does not represent control effect.
闵行区有254万人口，是一个大区，户籍人口小于外来人口的一个区，新上海人多，因此防控难度是很大。
Minhang District, with a population of 2.54 million, is a large area with a population smaller than that of the foreign population.
在他看来，防控的关键，是返工、返城、返学这三返人员到了之后，能有效控制。
In his view, the key to prevention and control is rework, return to the city, return to school after the arrival of the returnees, can effectively control.
因此，上海市仍旧处于紧张的防控状态。
As a result, Shanghai remains in a state of intense control.
针对三返人群，上海也做了预案。
Shanghai has also made plans for the returnees.
1 月 27日，上海市人民政府发布关于延迟上海市企业复工和学校开学紧急通知，各类企业不早于2月9日24时前复工。
On January 27, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government issued an emergency notice concerning the delay in the resumption of business and the opening of schools in Shanghai.
涉及保障城市运行必需（供水、供气、供电、通讯等行业）、疫情防控必需（医疗器械、药品、防护品生产和销售等行业）、群众生活必需（超市卖场、食品生产和供应等行业）及其它涉及重要国计民生的相关企业除外。
It covers such areas as water supply, gas supply, power supply, communications, etc.), the prevention and control of epidemic diseases (medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, protective goods production and marketing, etc.), the necessities of life of the masses (supermarkets, food production and supply industries) and other enterprises of vital national importance.
“已经返沪的人群，我们采集到他的健康信息之后，交由各个单位、各个企业、各个社区，按照市里面统一要求，定期了解其健康状况，不一定要完全隔离。
"The people who have returned to Shanghai, having gathered his health information, are sent to various units, enterprises and communities to follow the unified requirements of the city and learn about his state of health on a regular basis, not necessarily in complete isolation.
但湖北籍及途经湖北的，我们对他要14 天的医学观察。
But Hubei nationality and those who pass through Hubei, we want 14 days of medical observation to him.
”△ 隔离观察点工作区，刘冉摄隔离区的规则与温情家长在隔离，6岁儿童看病谁接送？1月29日，大年初五，迎接财神爷的日子，也是一些基层医护人员春节调休的时间。
Isolation observation point work area, Liu Ran She area of separation rules and warm parents in isolation, 6-year-old children who see a doctor who sent? January 29, about five, to greet the day of the god of wealth, is also some grass-roots medical personnel the time of Spring Festival holiday.
但从大年初二开始，上海某社区卫生服务中心的200多名医护陆续返回，目前基本全员到岗。
But from the beginning of New Year's Day, more than 200 medical personnel from a community health service center in Shanghai have returned.
如上海其他200多个社区卫生服务中心一样，防控疫情的紧张情绪一直在蔓延。
As with more than 200 other community health centers in Shanghai, tensions have been spreading over the course of the epidemic.
隔离观察点与社区卫生服务中心仅一街之隔，原来是镇里的一家酒店。
Isolated observation point and community health service center is only one street away, it turned out to be a hotel in town.
共有60个房间，目前隔离了67人，已经满员。
A total of 60 rooms are currently separated from 67 and are fully occupied.
镇里已经在考虑安排下一个隔离点，以防如果再有新的人员需要送来隔离。
The town is already considering setting up the next quarantine site in case new personnel need to be brought in for quarantine.
“这个隔离观察点里，绝大部分都是从道口拦截下来的湖北来沪人员。
"Most of this quarantined observation point came to Shanghai from Hubei, where they stopped at the intersection.
”一位隔离观察点的工作人员说，湖北来沪人员，一开始在上海有固定住所的，实行居家隔离；没有固定住所的，采取集中隔离；后来防控升级，无论在上海有无住所，一律送到隔离观察点。
A staff member from an isolated observation point said that when Hubei arrived in Shanghai, it initially had a fixed residence in Shanghai and was isolated at home.
隔离人员要完全杜绝与外界接触，禁止串门，隔离点的一位医生介绍，“无聊就只有待在房间里看看电视”。
Quarantine personnel should be completely out of contact with the outside world, banned from visiting the door, the isolation point of a doctor said, "boring only stay in the room to watch TV."
隔离人员的饮食，会由镇政府安排，先送到酒店，再由专人送到各楼层的清洁区，隔离人员自己出来取。
The food of the isolated persons will be arranged by the township government, sent to the hotel, then sent to the cleaning area of each floor, the isolation personnel come out to pick up.
吃完后留下的垃圾，仍然由值班人员前去收取。
After eating garbage, still by the duty staff to collect.
医务人员进入楼层，必须全副武装，穿上全封闭的二级防护服。
Medical personnel entering the floors must be fully armed and wear fully enclosed secondary protective clothing.
观察时间是两周，在这段时间内，每个房间的床上用品都不更换，但房间内每天会进行清洁，消毒。
The observation time is two weeks, during which the bedding in each room is not changed, but the room will be cleaned and disinfected every day.
隔离人员有各种需求，可以打电话到前台，也可以找每个楼层的值班人员。
Quarantine personnel have a variety of needs, can call the front desk, can also look for the duty staff on each floor.
这家酒店里的隔离人员，尚未出现疑似感染的病例。
There have been no suspected cases of infection in the hotel's quarantine facility.
只有一个6岁儿童，有腹泻症状，已经由卫生服务中心派车，送到就近医院进行诊治。
Only a 6-year-old child with diarrhoea symptoms has been sent by the Health Services Centre to a nearby hospital for treatment.
经诊断，这名儿童是肠道感染。
The child was diagnosed with an intestinal infection.
由于家长在隔离中，孩子在医院没有监护人照管，应对公共危机，需要人们的合作与关爱，“我们只好自己辛苦一点，每隔两个小时都会打电话到医院，询问孩子的情况，好了再派车去接。
As parents in isolation, children in hospitals without guardians, the need for public crisis, people's cooperation and love, "we have to work hard, every two hours will call the hospital, ask about the child, send a car to pick up.
”隔离点一位值班医生说。
'said a doctor on duty at the quarantine point.
Play△ 医护人员穿上防护服准备去接隔离者的孩子，刘冉摄隔离点是24小时值班。
Health care workers put on protective clothing to pick up the isolated child, and Liu Ran She is on duty 24 hours a day.
白天包括后勤，会有20多人在场。
During the day, including logistics, more than 20 people will be present.
原则上是安排一名医生，两个公卫人员，一个护士，加上后勤，转运人员，驾驶员，还有行政领导也亲自督阵。
In principle, a doctor, two public health workers, a nurse, plus logistics, transporters, drivers, and administrators are also in charge.
夜间值班，也有七八个人。
There were seven or eight men on duty at night.
在道口排查，每个班次6人，每天三班，要安排18个人。
At the junction screening, 6 persons per shift, 3 shifts per day, 18 persons to be assigned.
其中夜班是晚上12点到早上8点。
The night shift is from 12 p.m. to 8 a.m.
排班的时候，所有医生护士都非常踊跃。
All the doctors and nurses were enthusiastic during the shift.
微信群里都是“我报名”，“我报名”…… “有很多同志从初一到现在都没睡几个小时。
"I sign up" and "I sign up..." "Many comrades have not slept for a few hours since junior high school.
”接受采访的医生，有几位都参加过当年的SARS防控，她们表示，和SARS时期相比，现在的防控更加规范，医疗规范流程第一时间下发，医务人员感染的几率就会很低。
Several of the doctors interviewed, who took part in SARS prevention and control in those days, said control was now more standard than in the SARS era, and that when medical procedures were first issued, the risk of infection was low.
到目前为止，服务中心还没有医护人员出现感染，或疑似感染。
So far, no medical staff have been infected or suspected to be infected.
防控网的后面，上海“小汤山”游刃有余上海首例新冠肺炎是1月20日晚在国家CDC确认后对外公布，这是一位56岁的女性患者，确诊后收治于上海市公共卫生临床中心（下称上海公卫中心）。
A 56-year-old woman admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinic (Shanghai Public Health Center) after being confirmed by the state CDC on the night of January 20.
1月24日，她治愈出院。
On 24 January, she was cured and discharged.
首例患者的处置在输入性疫情中尤为关键，和她有密切接触的人士立刻进行了医学观察，这都得益于上海在2003年SARS疫情中积累下来的经验，十余年中又不断改良。
The treatment of the first patient was particularly critical in the case of an imported epidemic, and those in close contact with her immediately observed the medical situation, which benefited from the experience accumulated by Shanghai in the SARS epidemic in 2003 and improved over the past decade or so.
层层防控网之下，作为集中收治此次肺炎患者的上海公卫中心，面对这场影响力大于SARS的疫情，显得游刃有余。
Under the network, as a centralized treatment of pneumonia patients in Shanghai Public Health Center, in the face of the impact of the SARS epidemic, appears to be more than enough.
上海公卫中心是SARS疫情后，在偏居一隅的金山区，建成的专门用于收治突发疫情患者等的三级甲等医院，作用类似于北京“小汤山”。
Shanghai Public Health Center is the SARS epidemic, in the corner of the Golden Mountain, built for the treatment of outbreak patients and other tertiary hospitals, similar to the role of Beijing "Xiaotangshan."
上海公卫中心主任朱同玉告诉八点健闻，一个城市必须预先考虑建设应对疫情的专门医疗机构。
Zhu Tongyu, director of Shanghai Public Health Center, told Eight Jiangnan that a city must consider building special medical institutions to deal with the epidemic.
“但往往是财神跟着瘟神走，瘟神一走，财政投入就忘掉了。
But it was the god of wealth who followed Misery; the moment Misery was gone, the financial investment was forgotten.
对于保证底线的东西，大家往往会忽略掉。
When it comes to ensuring the bottom line, people tend to ignore it.
”他依然记得，经历了SARS后，上海决意投入财政资金建公卫中心，而且是被列为当时的政府1号工程，由副市长杨晓渡督建，“天天睡在工地上”，用了半年时间扩建至10万平米，于2004年11月开业。
He still remembers that after the SARS epidemic, Shanghai decided to invest in the construction of the public health center, which was then listed as government project No. 1, built by Deputy Mayor Yang Xiaodu, "sleeping on the construction site every day," which took half a year to expand to 100,000 square metres and opened in November 2004.
目前全职医护、研究、管理人员等有1200多人。
There are more than 1,200 full-time medical, research and management personnel.
按上海的部署，此次疫情的疑似病例在全市各家医疗机构中收治，一旦确诊，就立即送至上海公卫中心。
According to the deployment of Shanghai, the suspected cases of the epidemic in the city's medical institutions, once diagnosed, immediately sent to the Shanghai Public Health Center.
这家中心有整整四座大楼都拥有“负压病房”，即指病房内的气压低于病房外的气压的病房，也是WHO在规定抢救非典等传染病病人时特别强调的一个重要条件。
The center has four full buildings with "negative pressure wards," rooms where the air pressure in the wards is lower than that outside the wards. It is also an important condition that the WHO places special emphasis on when it comes to rescuing patients with SARS and other infectious diseases.
而该中心拥有300余个负压病床、300余个普通病床，国内拥有此基础的城市屈指可数，甚至国外都很少见。
The center has more than 300 negative-pressure beds and more than 300 ordinary beds, with only a handful of cities in the country or even abroad.
“疫情面前应该先走一步，”朱同玉说，“临时建的和一年建的相比，结构质量、安全度等都无法相提并论，何况还需要设备、人员进行磨合。
"We should take a step ahead of the epidemic," Zhu said. "Temporary construction cannot be compared with that built a year ago.
”他更是提议可以在全国不同的区域考虑建国家应急医学中心。
He also suggested that national emergency medical centers could be considered in different regions of the country.
在重大疫情未发生的十余年里，这家机构的工作中心就放在传染病等临床研究上，在发现病毒等临床研究领域跻身于国际一流的水平。
In the decade or so since the outbreak did not occur, the organization has focused on clinical research, such as infectious diseases, and ranks among the best in the world in clinical research, such as virus detection.
它是此次最早发布新型冠状病毒全基因序列的机构之一，同时，也是最早发现治疗艾滋病药物对新冠肺炎早期患者有效的机构之一。
It was one of the first to release the new coronavirus gene sequence, and also one of the first to discover the effective treatment of early patients with new coronavirus.
朱同玉觉得，此次疫情“比预想的要复杂”，决不能掉以轻心。
Zhu felt the outbreak was "more complicated than expected" and must not be taken lightly.
如果上海的确诊人数增至150人，上海公卫中心就要启动临时病房的开建。
If the number of people diagnosed in Shanghai rises to 150, the Shanghai Public Health Center will start construction of a temporary ward.
“50亩草皮准备好了，图纸也已设计好，预留了地面600张床，需要建的时候随时可以。
"Fifty acres of turf is ready, drawings have been designed, 600 beds have been reserved and ready to be built when needed.
不能等到300个床位住满，才开始考虑。
We can't wait for 300 beds to fill up before we start thinking about it.
”他说。
'he said.
截至1月29日12时，上海新增16例确诊病例，总数上升至96例，离上海公卫中心“负压病房”床位的上限还绰绰有余。
As of 12: 00 on January 29, 16 new cases had been confirmed in Shanghai, bringing the total to 96, more than the maximum number of beds in the "negative pressure ward" at the Shanghai Public Health Center.
但即便有宽裕的医疗能力与硬件储备，朱同玉依然觉得，面对重大疫情最有力的武器并非多顶尖的医疗能力，而是“阻断传播源，隔离”，这才是核心。
But even with ample medical capacity and hardware, Zhu feels that the most powerful weapon in the face of a major outbreak is not so much the top-notch medical capabilities, but the "blockage of transmission, isolation," which is the core.
