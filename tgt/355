记者/梁婷 实习记者/李一鸣 陈威敬编辑/石爱华 刘汨多位志愿司机与接送的医务人员自拍合影自1月23日起，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部的几个通告切断了城区内外的公共交通。
Reporter / Leung Ting Intern Reporter / Li Yiming, Editor / Shi Ai Wah Luo where many volunteer drivers and hospital staff have taken photos with themselves. Since January 23, several notices of Wuhan's New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command have cut off public transport within and outside the city.
先后关闭了机场、火车站离汉通道。
The airport and railway stations have been closed off Han corridor.
在停运全市公交、地铁、轮渡以及长途客运之后，又停运网约出租车，规定巡游出租车（即普通出租车）实行单双号限行。
After stopping the city's public transportation, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transport, and then stop the network about taxis, cruise taxis (that is, ordinary taxis) to the implementation of single-digit restrictions.
公共交通停摆之后，6000辆出租车被紧急派往武汉城中区各个社区，服务居民和医务人员出行。
After the suspension of public transport, 6,000 taxis were rushed to communities in central Wuhan, serving residents and medical staff.
深一度记者了解到，虽然每个社区配备3至5辆出租车，但依旧存在社区内医务人员上下班通勤难的情况。
At one point, journalists learned that although each community was equipped with three to five taxis, there were still difficulties with commuting of medical staff to and from work in the community.
一位家住汉口、不会骑车的护士，需要五点起床，每天步行近3小时到医院上班。
A nurse who lives in Hankou and can't ride a bike needs to get up at five and walk nearly three hours to work every day.
深一度记者致电武汉市的多个社区，就车辆能否接送医务人员的问题，得到的回应各不相同。
At one point, journalists called various communities in Wuhan city and received different responses to questions about whether vehicles could transport medical personnel.
部分工作人员称社区出租车供老幼病者使用，医护人员另有专车。
Some staff say community taxis are for the elderly, the sick and the elderly.
也有工作人员提到，出租车有富余时可以用，没有富余医务人员需自己想办法。
It was also mentioned that taxis were available when there was spare time and that no spare medical staff needed to find their own way.
武汉公共交通关闭当天，多个民间志愿者车队群同时成立，一些由个人组织，一些由行业协会发起，志愿者义务接送医护人员，运送物资。
Wuhan public transport closed day, a number of non-governmental volunteer convoys were set up at the same time, some by individual organizations, some by industry associations, volunteers to transport medical personnel, transport goods.
武汉出城通道封闭以来，志愿司机为生养自己的武汉尽一份力的同时，也要面对突来的意外和患病的风险，志愿者中，一些人需要背着家人“偷偷”出来帮忙、一些司机每天要接上百个电话，义务接送十几趟，工作22个小时。
Wuhan closed out of the city, voluntary drivers for the birth of Wuhan, while also facing the risk of sudden accidents and illness, some of the volunteers have to "secretly" help their families, some drivers have to answer hundreds of calls a day, the duty of a dozen, work 22 hours.
志愿司机中有人发烧，有人出车祸，也有人因承受不了家庭的压力退出服务。
Some volunteer drivers have a fever, others have car accidents, and others quit the service because they cannot afford the pressure of their families.
因为志愿车队不够专业，发起人曾考虑过将志愿车队停下来，但因很多医护人员依靠志愿车队，“停下来”实难做到，目前有上千位民间车主加入志愿车队，往返社区和医院之间，成为武汉特殊时期的民间“摆渡人”。
Because the volunteer fleet was not professional enough, the promoters considered stopping it, but because many relied on volunteer convoys, "stopping" proved difficult. Thousands of private car owners now joined the volunteer fleet, commuting between communities and hospitals to become folk "ferrymen" during Wuhan's special period.
热血早上6点20闹钟响了，常安没听到，再睁眼已经6点50。
Hot Blood The alarm went off at 6: 20 a.m. Chang'an didn't hear it and opened his eyes at 6: 50.
约好7点接护士去精神卫生中心上班，她有点急了。
Got an appointment to take the nurse to the mental health center at 7: 00. She's in a hurry.
抓起手机，给护士发了一条微信，换上衣服，没来得及洗漱就出门了。
Grabbing the phone, he sent a message to the nurse, changed into clothes and went out before he could wash.
她轻手轻脚，不敢发出声响，因为这次“行动”是瞒着爸妈的。
She was too timid to make a sound, for this act was done without her parents' knowledge.
大年初一早上，天黑乎乎的，武汉还下着雨，沿路没几辆车。
On the morning of New Year's Day, the sky is dark, Wuhan is also raining, there are few cars along the road.
这是常安第一次以志愿者的身份加入到接送医务人员的行动当中。
It was the first time Chang'an had joined the effort to transport medical personnel as a volunteer.
“我一直在想快点开，别把别人搞迟到了。
"I've been thinking about driving fast, so don't make others late.
”常安今年22岁，是武汉本地的大学生。
Changan, 22, is a local university student in Wuhan.
除夕那天正吃午饭，她刷朋友圈，看到因为医护人员出行困难，民间正组织车接送。
New Year's Eve is eating lunch, she brushed friends circle, because medical staff travel difficulties, the people are organizing a car transfer.
她想加入，和爸妈争辩两个来回后，结果还是失败了。
She wanted to join in and argue with her parents for two rounds, but she failed.
父母坚决反对，“他们最后直接扔出一句，不是你强出头的时候，如果你病了我们怎么办？这把我塞死，没话说了。
"The parents were adamant," they finally threw out, "It's not your early days. What if you're sick? It's killing me."
”父母的忧虑很现实——外面危险，医护人员又是高危人群，风险太大。
Parents' concerns are real - outside dangers, and health-care workers are at high risk.
武汉市卫健委此前曾通报，该市共有15名医务人员确诊为新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎病例，另有1名为疑似病例。
Wuhan city health committee had previously informed that a total of 15 medical personnel in the city confirmed a new coronavirus infection pneumonia, and a suspected case.
但常安还是偷偷进了群，群里已经有志愿司机和医护人员400多人，不断有人发消息求助。
But Chang'an still secretly entered the group, the group already has more than 400 volunteer drivers and medical personnel, people continue to send messages for help.
她还在群里找到了曾经的吉他老师，他们简短交流：“你也进了群，不愧是我崇拜的师父”，“干的漂亮，不愧是我徒弟”。
She also found a former guitar teacher in the group, and they spoke briefly: "You have joined the group, worthy of my admiration as a teacher" and "You did a good job, worthy of being my apprentice."
7点20，她们汇合。
7: 20. They meet.
常安听护士讲，她的同事住在汉口，不会骑自行车，早上五点多就要步行出发，走三个小时才能到医院。
Chang'an heard from the nurse that her colleagues, who lived in Hankou and could not ride bicycles, had to walk for more than five in the morning and three hours to get to the hospital.
护士一直感谢常安，“现在哪有出租车，不是你，我真不知道怎么上班。
"The nurse kept thanking Chang'an." I don't know how to get a taxi, not you.
”当天晚上，护士还发了朋友圈，“感谢早上摸黑起床，送我上班，我不认识你，但是衷心谢谢你。
"That night, the nurse also sent out a circle of friends." Thanks for getting up in the morning and seeing me off to work.
”在武汉，像常安一样加入志愿车队的有几千人，他们多是在朋友圈看到求助消息，有需要运送口罩、防护服这些物资，也有需要接送医护人员，他们扫码加入不同的群，人性中最朴素的善良一点点显露。
In Wuhan, thousands of people joined the volunteer corps like Chang'an, mostly in groups of friends who saw help, needed masks, protective clothing and needed to transport medical staff, sweeping up to join different groups and revealing the most simple goodness in human nature.
一个12年前参加过汶川地震灾区救援的“老兵”象哥，把车开上了武汉街头，他的宗旨是“不急不停”，除了接送医护人员，他偶尔还接送病患家属。
A 12-year-old veteran of the Wenchuan earthquake-hit areas, like brother, drove his car onto the streets of Wuhan, his purpose is "not in a hurry," in addition to transport medical personnel, he occasionally to pick up the families of patients.
一位母亲在志愿者群看到需要接人，替自己读大三的儿子报了名。
A mother in the volunteer group saw the need to meet people, for their third year of school son registered.
她希望儿子有责任感，接触更多人，认识社会。
She wants her son to be responsible, reach out to more people and get to know society.
这位母亲十月中旬曾有过类似的病情，发烧，拉肚子，身上疼痛，直到11月底彻底转好。
The mother had a similar condition in mid-October, fever, diarrhea, and pain until the end of November.
对于这次疫情，她并不过分忧虑。
She was not unduly worried about the outbreak.
但恐慌也不是那么容易缓解，因为家里两位老人的反对，一位男生除夕夜加入志愿者车队之后，年初一又退出了。
But the panic was not so easy to ease, because two elderly family members objected, a boy joined the volunteer team on New Year's Eve, and then quit on the first day.
他家离华南海鲜批发市场很近，父母年过60，同事的家人出现感染，二老非常担心。
His home is near the South China Seafood Wholesale Market. His parents are over 60 years old.
他不得已放弃，选择做车辆调度服务。
He had to give up and chose to do vehicle dispatch service.
早上送完护士，常安急忙回家。
After seeing off the nurse in the morning, Chang'an hurried home.
不到九点，父母还在睡，她没有露馅。
Before nine o'clock her parents were still asleep and she was not showing up.
常安说，因为年轻，总有一腔热血在，开车出去的时候既兴奋又害怕。
Because of his youth, Chang'an said, he was always excited and afraid to drive out.
在这种特殊的时候，她终于帮到别人。
At such a special time, she finally helped others.
但也有点不好意思，护士一下车，她就会猛喷消毒水，“虽然我一腔热血，但还是怕。
But also a bit embarrassed, nurses get out of the car, she would spray disinfectant, "although I was hot, but still afraid.
”志愿者转运救援物资汇集志愿车队大多成立于除夕这天。
Most volunteer convoys were set up on New Year's Eve.
1月23日，武汉市新型肺炎防控指挥部连发5个通告。
On January 23, Wuhan New Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command issued five circulars.
先后关闭机场、火车站离汉通道。
Airport and railway stations have been closed off Han corridor.
在停运全市公交、地铁、轮渡以及长途客运之后，又停运网约出租车，规定巡游出租车实行单双号限行。
After stopping the city's public transportation, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transport, and then stop the network about taxis, cruise taxis to implement the double-digit restrictions.
公共交通停摆，出行首先成了难题。
When public transportation stops, travel becomes a problem first.
1月24日上午，平康的朋友圈有医护朋友求助：很多同事走路上班，怀孕八个月孕妇也要骑自行车上班。
On the morning of Jan. 24, Hikkang's circle of friends had medical friends asking for help: many colleagues walk to work and pregnant women ride bicycles to work eight months after pregnancy.
平康回复“想帮你”。
Pingkang replies "I want to help you."
他截图在自己朋友圈寻求帮助，随后进入了医护出行互助的微信群。
He sought help in his circle of friends and entered the medical travel community.
一开始他完全只是想帮朋友。
At first he just wanted to help his friends.
进群之后，看到要车的人太多，就开始帮群主一起招司机。
After entering the group, to see too many people want cars, began to help the group together to recruit drivers.
平康介绍，当时的群主不是武汉人，对武汉道路不熟悉，平康就成为了新的管理员。
Pingkang introduced that the group master was not Wuhan people, Wuhan road is not familiar with, Pingkang has become a new administrator.
当天开了四个群，前两个群很快满了，平康又拉了一帮比较负责的朋友一起加入进来，开始运营。
The day opened four groups, the first two groups soon full, Pingkang and a group of more responsible friends joined in to start the operation.
有些车队群的组建则完全是被动的。
Some fleets are formed on a purely passive basis.
朱文对于成为群主这件事，有点哭笑不得，他在网上看到武汉市红十字会发布的招募信息，转了出去。
Zhu Wen for becoming a group of owners, a little crying, he saw on the Internet Wuhan Red Cross issued recruitment information, turned out.
本来只准备当志愿者，但一个微博大V转发的时候把他的微信号带着了。
He was supposed to be a volunteer, but a microphone picked up when a microphone was relayed.
从除夕下午两点开始，一个小时之内有一两百人开始加他，他不得已当了群主，“被迫营业。
From two o'clock in the afternoon of New Year's Eve, a hundred or two people began to add to him in an hour.
”出行之外，大型物资配送也受到影响。
In addition to travel, large-scale material distribution has also been affected.
武汉物流协会的秘书长石君告诉深一度记者，1月23号之前，他们零星地对接省外物流在武汉市内运送物资的工作。
Shi Jun, secretary-general of the Wuhan Logistics Association, told reporters that before January 23, they had sporadically docked deliveries of goods from outside the province to Wuhan.
大年三十之后，武汉要建火神山医院，很多司机已经返乡。
After the Chinese New Year's Eve, Wuhan will build a fire god mountain hospital, many drivers have returned home.
人手不够，活动板房、集装箱房这些东西没人配送。
There is not enough manpower, mobile board room, container room these things are not distributed.
在向公安局，交通局等部门报备之后，他们向在汉司机发出了倡议。
After reporting to the Public Security Bureau, the Transportation Bureau and others, they launched an initiative with the Han drivers.
目前他们有两个群，一个是运送大型物资的货车群，已经有213人。
At present they have two groups, one is a large cargo truck fleet, has 213 people.
另一个是运送小件物资的私家车群，人数也超过200。
The other is a fleet of private cars carrying small goods, also numbering over 200.
但无论是司机数量还是货车数量都远远不够。
But neither the number of drivers nor the number of trucks is enough.
据石君介绍，火神山医院的建设要在6天之内完成，6天中会有2000个集装箱从全国各地运来，还有活动板房、建设材料，医疗物资等，货车至少还需要两百多台。
According to Shijun, the construction of the Mount Huoshen Hospital will be completed within six days, with 2,000 containers transported from all over the country in six days, mobile homes, construction materials, medical supplies and at least 200 trucks.
石君每天要接上百个电话。
Shi Jun has hundreds of calls every day.
有一晚，凌晨一点钟，一个司机在高速路口对接货物。
One night, at one o'clock in the morning, a driver docked goods at a high-speed junction.
第二天早晨七点多又被派去工作。
He was sent to work again at seven o'clock the next morning.
武汉道路上车辆稀少忙乱平康非常忙碌，半夜两三点睡已经习以为常。
Wuhan on the road is very busy and busy traffic, two or three in the middle of the night has become accustomed to sleep.
他所在的微信群，消息日日过千，医务人员求助不断。
His community of micro-believers, daily news over, medical staff to help.
求车消息从早上六点开始，一条条弹出，一直持续到凌晨一两点。
The search for information began at six in the morning and popped up one after another until one or two in the morning.
有下夜班回家的，有急忙上班的，有一个礼拜见不到儿子想去看看的。
Some come home from night shift, some rush to work, one week did not see his son would like to see.
司机们一天跑六、七趟是常态，很多人要接送十几趟。
Six or seven trips a day are the norm for motorists, many of whom make a dozen trips.
1月28日，群里有司机说“早上起来连打喷嚏，所以在屋多待哈子，没问题的话再出门”。
On January 28, a driver in the group said, "You sneeze in the morning, so wait in the house until you have no problem."
他们中也有人瞒着父母、妻子，和家人分开住。
Some of them also live separately from their families, without their parents or wives.
他们要抵抗疲惫，还要预防可能存在的风险。
They have to resist fatigue and guard against possible risks.
有人只买到超市最便宜的口罩，出门要戴三层。
Some people buy only the cheapest masks in supermarkets and wear three layers when they go out.
司机们也会接到非医护人员的求助。
Drivers also receive help from non-paramedics.
有人混在群里，司机到了接人地点才发现没有工作证。
Someone mixed in, and the driver arrived at the pick-up point to find no work permit.
有人会直接说明情况，自己不是医护人员，但家人生病需要车，平康接到这样的求助，也很无奈，但只能拒绝。
Some people will directly state that they are not health care workers, but the family sick need cars, Ping Kang received such help, but can only refuse.
“我们也想帮他们，但之前就定了规矩，不接病患。
"We wanted to help them, too, but we had a rule not to take patients.
不管多么可怜，我们都不能接。
No matter how pitiful, we can't take it.
”群里不间断发出提示信息，强调只接送医护人员，请医护人员主动向司机提供证件信息，也请司机务必核验乘车人的证件。
The group continued to send reminders, stressing that only paramedics should be transported, that medical staff should provide drivers with identification information on their own initiative, and that drivers should be required to verify the identity of the occupants.
有专职人员每隔几小时会发消息提醒司机做好个人防护和消毒。
Drivers will be alerted to personal protection and disinfection by a dedicated staff every few hours.
1月25日下午，指挥部下发的9号通告又打乱了志愿者群正常的工作节奏。
On the afternoon of 25 January, Circular No. 9 issued by the command headquarters disrupted the normal pace of work of the volunteer corps.
通告指出，2020年1月26日0时后，除经许可的保供运输车、免费交通车、公务用车外，中心城区区域实行机动车禁行管理。
The circular states that, after 0000 hours on 26 January 2020, motor vehicles will be banned in the central urban areas, with the exception of licensed transport vehicles, free transport vehicles and official vehicles.
1月25日晚间，又补充解释，市公安交管部门将对禁止通行的车辆提前24小时通告司机，对未通告的车辆一律实行通行。
On the evening of 25 January, it was explained that the municipal public security traffic control authorities would notify drivers 24 hours in advance of prohibited vehicles and would impose traffic restrictions on unannounced vehicles.
若遇紧急情况，可先通行，再到交管部门补办手续。
In case of emergency, you can go first and then go to the traffic control department to do the procedure.
若违反通告，将从严从重处罚，直至记12分。
In case of violation of the circular, the penalty is increased to 12 points.
很多人摸不着头脑：到底出去还是不出去？医护工作者也不知道私家车也被禁行之后，谁来安排他们出行。
Many people don't know whether to go out or not, nor do health-care workers know who will arrange for private cars after they have been banned.
所有人都是搞不清的状态，不停地查找、搜索。
All people are confused, constantly looking for, searching.
1月26日一早，司机群里，询问不止：出去的遇到检查了吗？扣分了么？证明怎么开？三环可以上么？可以跨区接送么？人们摸不清政策的走向，有的人干脆不管不顾，“扣分就扣分，人还是要送。
January 26, the early morning, the group of drivers, more than: out of the encounter check? penalty points? How to open? Can the Third Ring? Can cross-district transport? People can not understand the direction of the policy, some people simply ignore, "points deducted, people still give.
人命更重要。
Human life is more important.
”有人开始观望，停了一天。
"Some one began to wait and see, and stopped for a day.
无序和不确定让司机们更加忧虑。
The disorder and uncertainty have added to the drivers' anxiety.
他们不知道行驶途中若被监控拍下来，事情结束以后，自己的驾照会不会直接被吊销。
They don't know if their driver's license will be revoked directly after the incident is over if they are monitored and filmed.
在接受深一度记者采访时，一名司机非常不理解，他认为目前的举措混乱。
In an interview with a once-in-a-lifetime reporter, one driver was puzzled, saying the current move was messy.
“如果不是工作必要或者缺乏基本的生活储备，谁会在这个时候，没事在城里面开车到处跑？现在在外面开车的，除了志愿者、病患家属就是医务工作者。
"If it weren't for the necessity of work or the lack of a basic living reserve, who would be driving around the city at this time of year?
”开车上路的司机发现好像情况可以，碰到交警排查，说明情况，拿出群聊记录，也就放行了，没有说要办理证件。
"When the driver saw that it was okay, he ran into a traffic policeman, explained the situation, took out a group report, and then let go without saying he wanted to have his papers processed.
有人遇到交警，当即被拦，虽然当时放行了，但仍让他找医护人员或社区开证明。
Someone encountered a traffic policeman and was stopped immediately. Although he was allowed to do so, he was asked to seek medical advice or a certificate from the community.
也有司机说，在关卡遇到交警，不仅没拦他，还给他敬礼了。
Drivers said that at the checkpoint encountered the traffic police, not only did not stop him, but also salute him.
一位志愿司机在运送物资时发生车祸隐患最近几天，不同的志愿车队接连出现一些问题。
A volunteer driver has been involved in a car accident while carrying supplies. In recent days, different volunteer convoys have been experiencing problems.
一位司机第一天回家之后就发烧到38.5度。
One driver went home with a fever of 38.5 degrees on the first day.
家里有小孩，他的妻子一直哭。
There were children in the family and his wife cried all the time.
直到烧退下来，检查确认不是这病，家里人才放心。
Until the fever recedes and the examination confirms that it is not the case, the family can rest assured.
朱文听说，还有三个志愿者司机也出现了发热症状。
Zhu heard that three other volunteer drivers also developed fever symptoms.
他认为政府应该担起这件事，有需要，可以找民间辅助，一直让他们做，不是长久之计。
He believed that the Government should take up the matter, if need be, can find civil support, let them do it all the time, not a long-term solution.
“如果政府做得特别好，不需要我帮忙，我更高兴，我也不是多想去做这些。
"I'm happier if the government is doing really well and doesn't need my help, and I don't want to do that much," he said.
”还有一些意外，也开始发生。
There were other accidents, and they began to happen.
1月26日下午6点10分，一位司机在运送口罩和酒精的路上出了车祸。
At 6: 10 p.m. on January 26, a driver was involved in an accident on his way to deliver masks and alcohol.
保险杠全部跌落，车头右侧破损严重。
All bumpers were dropped and the right side of the car badly damaged.
好在人没事。
Luckily, it's okay.
这位司机说，忙的时候他每分钟要处理1000多条信息，有一天连续工作了22个小时，开车的时候总觉得自己有些事还没做，容易走神。
The driver, who handles more than 1,000 messages a minute during rush hours, worked 22 consecutive hours one day and feels like he hasn't done something yet and is distracted.
这位司机也是平康的朋友，车祸第一时间，他给平康打了电话，找人来把物资接走了。
This driver is also plain Kang's friend, the first time the car accident, he called Ping Kang, someone to pick up the goods.
平康说，“他这几天都是早上6点多出发，晚上11点才回。
"He leaves late these days at more than 6 am and doesn't return until 11 pm," he said.
不运送物资的时候，就去接送医护人员。
When no supplies are delivered, pick up the paramedics.
有一天晚上八点多我给他打电话，他告诉我，已经一天没吃饭了。
I called him over eight one evening and he told me he hadn't had a meal for a day.
”事情发生以后，志愿服务队也在思考。
"After that, the volunteer service was thinking.
他们说，建群的初心只是想着度过空档期，但没想到空档期的时间有点长。
They said that Jian Qun's initial intention was just to get through the slotting period, but they did not expect a bit longer.
志愿者群的发起人也处于两难境地。
The sponsors of the volunteer corps are also in a dilemma.
司机来自各行各业，一些岁数大的也不停地接单，整天都在各大医院间接送，正餐吃不上，体力跟不上，超负荷运转。
Drivers from all walks of life, some of the elderly also keep orders, all day long in major hospitals indirectly, meals do not eat, physical strength can not keep up with, overload operation.
群里的管理员也是临时召集，平均年龄不大，经验有限。
Managers in the group are also convened on an ad hoc basis, with a small average age and limited experience.
最重要的是，这件事有很大风险，涉及人命，不是儿戏。
Above all, it was a high-risk affair, involving human life, not a joke.
曾有司机提出，这样零散的组织没有找到正规公益组织挂靠之前，必须停下来。
Drivers have suggested that such scattered organizations must stop before they can find a formal public interest group to hang on to.
但停下来也不容易。
But stopping isn't easy.
目前，依旧有很多医护人员的出行需求没办法解决，根据近四天的统计，就有400名医护人员依靠志愿者提供的车辆上下班。
At present, there are still many medical staff travel needs can not be solved, according to the past four days statistics, 400 health-care workers rely on volunteer vehicles to work.
如果停下来了，他们不知道这些医护人员该怎么办。
If they stop, they don't know what to do with the paramedics.
深一度记者致电武汉市车辆应急服务热线电话，询问关于医护人员的出行时，工作人员告诉记者，政府配的车全在社区，有用车需要，要联系社区看能不能派车。
When asked about the travel of medical staff, staff told reporters that all government vehicles are in the community, there is a need to contact the community to see if the car can be sent.

但有医护人员打电话寻求帮助时，得到的答复是，出租车限行，没有了。
But when paramedics called for help, they were told that taxis were restricted and not available.
1月27日武汉市长周先旺在接受央视《面对面》记者采访时介绍，给每个社区配备3到5辆出租车的第一个作用是承担社区内医护人员接送。
The first role in equipping each community with three to five taxis is to take care of the transportation of medical personnel in the community, Wuhan Chang Zhou Sang-wang told CCTV's Face-to-Face interview on January 27.

Once the reporter called Wuhan Huaxiao community, the staff said that the community car distribution is for the old and young patients, the medical staff have a special car.
天兴花园社区的工作人员则说如果车有富余可以用，没有富余自己想办法。
Tianxing Garden community workers said if the car has surplus to use, there is no surplus to do their own way.
一位医护人员下车后留下一盒口罩靠近忙乱中，人与人的一些关系更加靠近。
A paramedic got out of the car and left a box of masks close to the bustle.
常安在初一下午，以买猫粮为理由，成功出门，接了两个中心医院的护士下班，一个95年生人，一个97年生人。
Chang'an in the afternoon of the junior high school, to buy cat food as a reason, successfully went out, took two central hospital nurses off work, a stranger in 95, a stranger in 1997.
常安说，她们很焦虑，医院的口罩、防护服都不够，一个口罩戴一天，从早忙到晚不能休息，餐餐吃泡面。
Chang'an said they were anxious, the hospital mask, protective clothing are not enough, a mask wearing a day, from early morning to night can not rest, meals eat noodles.
护士们想过辞职，但辞职又可能被吊销执照。
The nurses thought of resigning, but could have their licenses revoked.
常安感慨，差不多的年龄，有人就要这样顶在前线。
Chang'an laments that at about the same age, some people have to be on the front line like this.
分开之后，两个护士和她说，等事情过去了，一定要约着一起出来玩。
After the break-up, the two nurses told her that when it was over, they would make an offer to come out to play.
陈顺在年初一加入车队，他们一家三口和岳父岳母住在一起。
