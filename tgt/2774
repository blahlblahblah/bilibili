很多年没有遇到孩子离开父母隔离治疗的情况，所以我们更要把小孩照顾好。
For many years there were no cases of children being separated from their parents for treatment, so we should take good care of the children.
我们医护人员最见不得孩子受苦。
We paramedics do not suffer as much as children.
记者 | 黄 祺难得上海冬日艳阳，穿上白色毛茸茸连体衣的小齐齐，在阳光下变成了白白胖胖的一团小肉球，妈妈看到她难以抑制激动：宝宝都让你们养胖了。
Rarely do Shanghai's sunny winters and tiny little chunks in white, woolly jumpsuits turn into a chubby little ball of meat in the sun. My mother sees how she has struggled to contain her excitement: the baby has made you fat.
这一天是2020年的2月20日，7个月大的小齐齐被复旦大学儿科医院传染科病房主任曾玫医生抱在怀里，曾玫医生身旁的传染科病区护士长夏爱梅手里是一个米老鼠公仔，那是照顾小齐齐17天的所有医护人员送给她的礼物。
On February 20, 2020, the seven-month-old Qi Zeng was held in her arms by Dr. Zeng Mee, director of the department of pediatric wards of Fudan University. Xia Aimei, the head nurse of the infectious disease area next to Dr. Mae, was holding a Mickey Mouse doll, a gift from all the doctors and nurses who cared for him for 17 days.
小齐齐，是上海市截至今天（3月5日）收治的儿童新冠肺炎患者中最小的一名，她的治疗一直牵动人心，出院这天，她也自然成为上海全城人关注的焦点。
Xiao Qi, the youngest child to be admitted to Shanghai so far today (March 5), is the youngest person to have been treated for pneumonia. Her treatment has been very moving, and on that day she naturally became the focus of attention in Shanghai.
就要将小齐齐送回妈妈怀中，17天日夜照顾小齐齐的医护人员心中又是欣慰又有点不舍，曾玫医生动情地在小齐齐脸上亲了一下，而这一瞬间被《新民晚报》摄影记者捕捉到，照片刊登在当天的《新民晚报》头版上。
It was comforting and disheartening to have him back in his mother's arms for 17 days to care for the small Qi-qi medical staff. Dr. Zeng gave Qi a passionate kiss on the face and was captured by the New People's Evening News cameraman on the front page of the same day.
温情的一幕，通过报纸和新媒体，传递到上海市民面前，令全城感动。
The sentimental scene, through newspapers and new media, reached Shanghai's citizens and moved the whole city.
而这幅意味深长的新闻图片，也获得了上海市委书记李强点赞。
And this meaningful news picture, also won Shanghai municipal party secretary Li Qiang praise.
大家看到的是温馨的一瞬间，但这一幕背后，为了收治儿童新冠肺炎患者，一家医院、一个团队、一群人在一个多月的时间里，还有很多很多值得书写的故事。
You see a warm moment, but behind this scene, a hospital, a team, a group of people for more than a month, there are a lot of stories to write about.
十年来首次，没有妈妈的隔离病房视频里，小齐齐已经安静躺下，护士阿姨坐在小板凳上，戴着三层手套的手从婴儿床栏杆间隙中穿进去，轻轻拍打小齐齐，哄她入睡……Play另一张照片里，小齐齐躺在穿着防护服的护士阿姨怀中，护士手里一手拿碗，一手拿勺，正在喂她吃辅食……还有一张照片，画面中不是小齐齐，而是一名一岁多的小患者，双脚浸在脚盆里，护士阿姨正在给她洗脚……护士给生病宝宝洗脚，等她睡着后，护士们就在门外看护着她复旦大学附属儿科医院，是上海市唯一一家儿童新冠肺炎患者定点治疗医院，全市迄今为止全部11名患儿，都在这里接受治疗，目前已经有7人治愈出院。
For the first time in a decade, little Qi Qi was lying quietly in a seclusion video of her mother. Nurses and aunts sat on a bench, three-glove hands passed through the bars of the crib and patted her feet.
医护人员们有空的时候，用手机记录下隔离病房里的种种小细节，大家把这些画面发送给孩子们的爸爸妈妈，让他们安心。
When paramedics are free, they record the details of the isolation ward on their cell phones and send them to their mothers and dads to reassure them.
虽然这里是传染病科，但没有家长陪护的情况下治疗和照顾新冠传染病患儿，对于医护人员来说是十年来第一次经历，无疑充满挑战。
Although this is an infectious disease unit, treating and caring for children with Newcrown Infectious Diseases without a parent is a challenging experience for health-care professionals for the first time in a decade.
上海收治第一例新冠肺炎儿童患者，时间是2020年1月19日，当天晚上，一名7岁的孩子被他的妈妈带到儿科医院就诊，孩子曾经和爸爸一起到过武汉，回到上海后爸爸生病，他也被诊断为新冠肺炎患者（按照当时规定，确诊病例要由国家CDC复核后公布，因此小患者确诊公布时间不是1月19日）。
In Shanghai, the first child with pneumonia was admitted on January 19, 2020, when a 7-year-old child was taken to a paediatric hospital by his mother. The child had been in Wuhan with his father.
曾玫主任接诊了这位小患者，按照医院此前已经做好的收治新冠肺炎患者预案，启动了所有重大新发传染病防护措施，孩子从专门的通道转入病房。
Zeng Mei treated the small patient, according to the hospital has been prepared for the admission of patients with pneumonia, launched all major new infectious disease prevention measures, children from the special channels into the ward.
传染科病房几天前也已经完成了调整，孩子被收入病房，妈妈立即接受了防护培训，一起住进一间独立的隔离病房。
The infection ward was adjusted a few days ago, and the child was admitted to the ward, where the mother immediately received protection training and was admitted to a separate isolation ward.
“1月19日各地还没有太多收治经验，儿科患者也还没有考虑孩子要与家长隔离，所以这位妈妈是进病房陪护的，她也是唯一陪护的家长，后来就不允许了。
"There wasn't a lot of treatment experience around January 19 and the pediatric patients didn't consider separating the child from the parents, so the mother went to the hospital room to accompany her, and she was the only one who stayed with her and was not allowed to do so.
”护士长夏爱梅告诉《新民周刊》，这位妈妈非常理解医护人员，她总是说：我尽量自己多照顾孩子，你们护士少进来。
Xia Aimei, the head nurse, told Xinmin Weekly that the mother understood the paramedics very well and always said, "I try to take care of my children as much as you nurses can.
几天后，考虑到陪护家属密切接触有可能被感染，医院要求所有新冠患儿不陪护，由医护人员24小时陪护患儿。
A few days later, considering the close contact of the accompanying family members with the risk of infection, the hospital asked all newly-crowned children to be accompanied by medical staff on a 24-hour basis.
这也是一个不得不做的决定——很多患儿的家人都已经感染，成人患者必须到上海市公共卫生临床中心隔离治疗。
It was also a forced decision - many of the children's families had been infected and adult patients had to be quarantined at the Shanghai Public Health Clinic.
这是十年来第一次出现传染病隔离病房患儿没有家长陪护的情况。
This is the first time in a decade that a child in an infectious disease isolation ward is unaccompanied by a parent.
夏爱梅介绍，常见的儿童传染病一般不会传染给成人，2009年后，为了给儿童患者更好的人文关怀，医院开放了传染病病房的家长陪护。
Xia Aimei said the common childhood infectious diseases do not usually infect adults. After 2009, the hospital opened the infectious disease ward for parents to accompany them.
但随着疫情的进展，从相关法规和降低交叉感染风险出发，孩子单独隔离治疗的措施在取消十年后重新启用。
But as the epidemic progresses, measures to separate children for treatment are reintroduced 10 years after elimination, based on regulations and reduced risk of cross-infection.
曾玫主任介绍说，从目前收治的新冠肺炎儿童患者情况看，儿童患者都是轻症，因此救治难度相对比成人重症患者要小一些，但隔离病房中的照护压力则大很多。
She said that in the current treatment of children with pneumonia, children are mild, so treatment is less difficult than adult patients with severe illness, but the isolation ward care pressure is much greater.
对于幼小的孩子，病房里的医护人员，充当了妈妈的角色，但穿着防护服当好妈妈，却不是想象中那么容易。
For young children, the hospital staff in the ward acted as mothers, but wearing protective clothing was not as easy as expected.
小齐齐入院第一个晚上，离开妈妈的怀抱，来到陌生的环境，她哭闹了整整一个晚上。
On his first night in hospital, Xiao Qi left his mother's arms and went to a strange environment. She cried all night.
这个晚上，从未做过妈妈的护士一直抱着她安抚，两三天后小齐齐才逐渐适应。
The nurse, who had never been a mother, held her in her arms for two or three days before Qiqi got used to it.
“我们90后的护士，自己还没有结婚，但当起临时妈妈却特别耐心。
"Our 90-year-old nurse wasn't married herself, but she was very patient as a temp mother.
”夏爱梅说。
"said she.
护士长夏爱梅印象最深的，是一个手忙脚乱的下午。
What impressed the head nurse most was a hectic afternoon.
病房里两个孩子，一个是要抱抱的小齐齐，另一个是医生护士一靠近就哇哇大哭的一岁小朋友。
There were two children in the ward, one a small Qi in a hug and the other a one-year-old crying baby as the doctor and nurse approached.
一岁小朋友对医护人员的防护服特别恐惧，大家特意换了一款有点像修女服的防护服，但依旧没有减轻小朋友的恐惧感。
One-year-old children are particularly afraid of the protective clothing of medical staff, we specially changed a kind of protective clothing for women, but still did not reduce the fear of children.
“你一靠近她就害怕，她就大哭，你想给她喂奶，给她吃饭她都不要吃。
"She cries when you come near her, and you want to feed her, and she won't eat.
这个时候作为我们护士来说，心里很崩溃的，又希望她赶紧吃点饭，但是我们一靠近她又哭，不要你的东西。
At this time as our nurses, the heart is very broken, and hope she hastens to eat some food, but as soon as we are close to her cry, do not want your things.
好长一段时间后，小朋友才开始适应。
It was a long time before the children got used to it.
”这一天夏爱梅在病房里照顾两个小朋友。
"That day Amy was in the hospital room looking after two children.
她抱起小齐齐，转头发现1岁多的小患者在床上站起来扶着小床围栏。
She picked up the tiny Qi Qi, turned around and found more than a year-old patients in bed stood up to support the small bed fence.
“我抱着小齐齐，怕1岁的小朋友摔倒，想去扶她，但她看到我过去又大哭。
"I held Qi Qi in my arms. I was afraid the 1-year-old child would fall down and try to help her.
”夏爱梅笑言，体会了一把二娃妈妈的艰难。
"Xia Aimei smiled and experienced the hardships of her mother.
在儿科医院新冠肺炎小患者中，也有十多岁的大孩子。
In the pediatric hospital in the new crown pneumonia small patients, there are also teenage children.
小宝宝需要24小时一刻不停的照顾，而年龄大一点的孩子，则需要操心生活细节和心理变化。
Babies need 24-hour, non-stop care, while older children have to worry about life details and psychological changes.
Play护士姐姐给小朋友跳舞缓解他们的紧张隔离病房中，曾有两个10岁小姑娘住院，其中一个孩子送到医院时家人已经隔离，所有的生活用品都是医院后勤部门帮她买来的。
Nurse Play's sister danced for the kids in their tight isolation ward, where two 10-year-old girls were hospitalized, one of whom arrived in isolation with her family and all her supplies were bought by the hospital logistics department.
后来，小姑娘们需要小东西，都会告诉最信任的护士姐姐和护士长。
Later, the little girls needed little things to tell their most trusted nurses, sisters and head nurses.
“小姑娘么，需要橡皮筋啊，润唇膏啊，一次性内裤啊这些小东西，有时候想吃零食啊。
"Little girl, need rubber band ah, lip balm ah, disposable underwear these little things, sometimes want to eat snacks ah.
我让她们写个清单，下班就去买好，第二天再给她们带到病房。
I asked them to write a list, pick them up after work, and bring them to the ward the next day.
”夏爱梅说。
"said she.
大孩子更让人担心的是心理上的焦虑情绪。
What worries older children more is their psychological anxiety.
为了让孩子和家长安心治疗，夏爱梅加了大孩子和他们家长的微信，解答他们的问题。
To put her children and parents at ease, she wrote letters to the older children and their parents to answer their questions.
“有时候小姑娘晚上睡不着觉，11点多给我发微信：夏阿姨我睡不着。
"Sometimes the little girl can not sleep at night, 11 more to send me a message: Aunt summer I can not sleep.
”夏爱梅说，护士们要承担对这些大孩子的心理疏导工作。
"The nurses are expected to take responsibility for counseling the older children, Xia said.
适当精准用药，收获儿童治疗上海经验从1月15日开始为接收新冠肺炎患儿做准备到今天，曾玫主任已经忙碌了一个多月，这段时间里她想得最多的，就是为新冠肺炎患儿提供最合理和适宜的治疗，达到理想的治疗效果。
/ [^ # 39 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105 ^ # 105] / n. From January 15 to today, she has been busy for more than a month.
作为感染性疾病专家，曾玫主任在儿童病毒性传染病的儿童诊疗上，做了大量的研究，根据积累的知识和经验，本着科学的态度和人文关爱的情怀，曾玫主任与专家组讨论后，为患儿制定了一套精简又适用的儿童治疗方案。
As an infectious disease specialist, she has done a lot of research on children's diagnosis and treatment of viral infectious diseases in children.Based on accumulated knowledge and experience, scientific attitude and humane care, Director Zeng developed a streamlined and suitable treatment program for children after discussion with the expert group.
“我们有一些基本的判断：首先，平时处理了这么多种感染呼吸道的病毒疾病，不管是哪种病毒引起的疾病，绝大多数儿童患者尤其是轻症患儿是可以自愈的；另外，目前没有针对新冠肺炎的特效抗病毒药物，推荐试用的抗病毒药物临床效果并不明确，因此我们决定对于非重症的儿童患者，不用抗病毒药物，给与对症处理，并且密切观察病情变化，及时干预。
"We have some basic judgments: firstly, we have dealt with so many viral diseases that infect respiratory tract in normal times, and the vast majority of children, especially the mild ones, can heal themselves. Besides, there are no specific antiviral drugs for Newcomial Pneumonia.
”曾玫主任说， 孩子如果咳嗽明显，就吃止咳的药物，或者联合雾化吸入治疗，以缓解改善症状，对于服药依从性好的儿童，给予中成药辨证治疗。
"If a child has a cough, take antitussive medication, or combine aerosol inhalation therapy to alleviate the symptoms," said Zeng.
上面的治疗方案，前提是对儿童患者病情密切的观察。
The above treatment regimen is based on close observation of the condition of the child patient.
“因为从成人的经验来看，通常发病一周左右病情可能加重，所以病情的观察是非常重要的，如果病情有蛛丝马迹的变化，我们马上要进行干预治疗，并跟进必要的检查。
"From the experience of adults, it is usually about a week before the onset of illness, so it is very important to observe the condition, and if there is any sign of change, we will immediately intervene and follow up the necessary examinations," he said.
”从所有出院患儿和正在接受治疗的患儿情况看，儿科医院传染病团队这一套个体化的适宜儿童的治疗方案，取得了很好的效果。
From all the children discharged from the hospital and those undergoing treatment, the paediatric hospital infectious diseases team has achieved a good result in the form of an individualized, child-friendly treatment package.
除了治疗，诊断儿童新冠肺炎患者也是一个全新的课题。
In addition to treatment, the diagnosis of children with new crown pneumonia is a new topic.
曾玫主任说，特别是后期，有个别儿童患者的流行病学暴露史不明确，小朋友有症状但没有成人病例接触史或者家庭聚集发病，医生如何做到不漏诊病人，是挑战和责任。
In particular, she said, it was a challenge and a responsibility for doctors not to miss out on patients, especially in the later stages, when the epidemiological exposure of individual children was unclear, when children had symptoms but no history of exposure in adult cases, or when there was a family gathering.
曾玫主任介绍，迄今团队已经发表4篇学术论文，总结了儿童新冠病人的救治经验，为今后的儿童新冠的诊治和预防带来借鉴。
So far, the team has published four academic papers summarizing the experience of treating children with the new crown, which can be used for reference in the treatment and prevention of children's new crown.
此前，儿科医院团队结合第五版国家诊疗方案和世界卫生组织指南的基础上，经过组建多学科专家团队，制定儿童新冠病毒筛查和临床实践指南，这个指南已经于2月8日发表在学术期刊上，为其它地区儿童新冠肺炎诊治提供指导。
Earlier, the paediatric team, in conjunction with the fifth edition of the National Diagnosis and Treatment Programme and the WHO guidelines, formed a multidisciplinary team of experts to develop a guide to screening and clinical practice for the new crown virus for children, which was published in the academic journal on 8 February to guide the treatment of new crown pneumonia in children in other regions.
如今，全国新冠疫情正在逐步缓解，曾玫团队已经开始做前瞻性的研究。
Now that the national crown epidemic is gradually abating, Rosa's team has begun to do forward-looking research.
她表示，如果新冠肺炎未来在人群中长期存在，那么医疗机构必须要做好常年收治新冠肺炎患者的准备，预防和治疗上要做更多的研究，减少疾病对孩子健康的伤害。
If pneumonia is to remain in the population for the long term, the institution must be prepared to treat patients with pneumonia over the years, she said. More research is needed on prevention and treatment to reduce the health risks.
11个孩子背后，是整个医院的支持随着小朋友陆续出院，儿科医院医护团队压力逐渐减轻。
Behind the 11 children was the support of the whole hospital. As the children were released from the hospital, the pressure on the paediatric hospital medical team gradually eased.
但回想起一个多月前收治患儿初期的压力，夏爱梅还是感慨万千。
But recalling more than a month ago in the initial treatment of children's stress, Xia Aimei is still sentimental.
承担收治新冠肺炎患儿任务后，儿科医院成立了领导小组和多学科专家组。
The paediatric hospital has set up a leading group and a multidisciplinary team of experts to take on the task of treating children with pneumonia.
收入患儿后，儿科医院党委书记徐虹到病区了解一线情况，徐虹书记问夏爱梅，有什么难处，有什么压力？“问到这里，我一下子没忍住，掉眼泪了。
After the income of the children, Pediatrics Hospital Party Secretary Xu Hong to understand the first line of the situation, Xuhong Secretary asked Xia Aimei, what difficulties, what pressure?
”夏爱梅是有着三十年工作经验的资深护士长，作为“大管家”，保障30名医护人员不受感染的重任，落到了她的肩上。
As head nurse with 30 years of experience, it fell to her as head butler to protect 30 health-care workers from infection.
“特别是疫情初期，大家并不清楚这个病传染性究竟如何，恐惧、紧张都有，我特别担心这些年轻人。
"Especially at the beginning of the epidemic, it was not clear how contagious it was. There was fear, tension, and I was especially worried about these young people.
”她说，团队里年轻的护士小姑娘，她一直当自己的孩子一样看待，“你说哪个父母会不担心自己的孩子去危险的地方？我必须保证他们的安全，不能有半点闪失。
She said the young nurse on the team, who had always treated her like a child, "Which parent would you say wouldn't worry about their children going to dangerous places?
”夏爱梅说，传染科病房每年都有例行的应对新发突发传染病的演练，科室也备有几十套防护用品，数量不算少，但疫情出现后，这样的准备还是不够，防护服很快就会用完。
The infectious-disease ward has a routine exercise each year to deal with new outbreaks, and the unit has dozens of sets of protective gear, not too small, but after the outbreak, such preparations are inadequate and protective clothing will soon run out, she said.
临近春节，采购很困难，特别着急。
Spring Festival approaching, procurement is very difficult, especially anxious.
责任感和紧急的疫情，让夏爱梅倍感压力。
The sense of responsibility and emergency situation, let Xia Aimei pressure.
那一场情绪失控“事件”，就是在这样的背景下发生的。
It was against this background that the emotional "event" got out of hand.
很快，防护物资紧缺的问题在医院和卫健委的支持下解决了，夏爱梅要做的，就是在流程上严格管理，确保医护人员的安全。
Very soon, the shortage of protective materials in the hospital and health care under the support of the support of the problem, Xia Ai Mei is to do is in the process of strict management, to ensure the safety of health-care personnel.
“他们进隔离病房时，我要帮他们穿好防护服。
"I'm going to help them put on protective clothing when they go into the isolation ward.
出来的时候，我就趴在窗口往里面看，盯着他们按照规范脱防护服。
As I came out, I leaned over the window and looked inside, staring at them as they took off their protective clothing.
”她说，经过这一次疫情，年轻的护士们用行动证明了她们的敬业精神、职业信仰。
"After the outbreak, the young nurses proved their professionalism and professional beliefs," she said.
小齐齐入院后，为了尽量降低风险，夏爱梅曾嘱咐护士们，无特殊情况不要一直抱着患病的宝宝，但护士们看到可爱又可怜的小齐齐，没有人犹豫迟疑，完全像真正的妈妈一样无微不至地照顾着她。
In order to minimize the risk of admission, Xia had instructed nurses not to hold the sick baby in their arms all the time, but when the nurses saw the cute and poor little Qi Qi, no one hesitated and looked after her with the same meticulous care as a real mother.
“我真的要感谢我们这些年轻的护士，非常感谢她们。
"I really want to thank our young nurses. Thank them very much.
我说你们上班辛苦了一定跟我说，夏老师天天在，任何事情都可以找我。
I said you work hard must tell me, Xia teacher every day, anything can come to me.
”疫情发生后连续三个星期，夏爱梅不曾休息一天，她牵挂着年轻的护士们，而护士们则牵挂着病房里没有父母陪伴的小朋友。
For three weeks after the outbreak, she did not take a day off, worrying about the young nurses who were worried about the children in the ward who were not accompanied by their parents.
儿科医院传染病团队，是国内有名的学术团队，每年不仅要接诊数量庞大的传染病患儿，还要收治疑难的感染性疾病患儿。
Paediatric Hospital Infectious Disease Team, is a well-known domestic academic team, not only to receive a large number of children with infectious diseases, but also to treat children with difficult infectious diseases.
作为感染性疾病专家，曾玫主任对团队在新冠肺炎疫情中的表现，也非常自豪。
As an infectious disease specialist, she was also very proud of her team's performance in the case of pneumonia.
“我们这个团队平常氛围就很好，我们一直奉行以病人为中心，在这次不寻常的疫情当中，团队的表现更加英勇，而且更加默契。
"Our team has always had a great atmosphere, we have been patient-centred and the team has been much more courageous and consistent in this unusual situation.
对我们来讲，很多年没有遇到孩子离开父母隔离治疗的情况，所以我们更要把小孩照顾好。
For many of us, we haven't seen our children leave their parents for years, so we have to take good care of our children.
我们医护人员最见不得孩子受苦。
We paramedics do not suffer as much as children.
”曾玫主任动情地说。
"said Zeng, feelingly.
一次疫情，就是一次考试，医生的理想信念，在火线通过了考验。
An epidemic, is an examination, the ideal faith of the doctor, in the line of fire passed the test.
3月2日，曾玫和夏爱梅两位抗疫一线的医护工作者，在复旦大学附属儿科医院新冠病毒肺炎前线指挥部郑重宣誓，从此她们肩上又多了一份共产党员的责任。
On March 2, Zeng Mee and Xia Aimei, two front-line anti-epidemic workers, took the solemn oath at Fudan University's Pediatric Hospital's New Crown Virus Pneumonia Front Command.
医院党委书记徐虹说，在这场突如其来的疫情面前，曾玫和夏爱梅以高度的责任感和使命感，带领团队冲锋在前，出色地完成了党和人民交给医护人员的光荣任务。
In the face of this sudden outbreak, she said, with a high sense of responsibility and mission, Mei and Xia Aimei led the team to the front and performed with distinction the glorious tasks entrusted to the medical staff by the Party and the people.
病房里小患者陆续出院，记者问夏爱梅，等疫情结束是否安排了休假。
Ward small patients continue to be discharged from the hospital, reporters asked Xia Aimei, such as whether the end of the epidemic arrangements for vacation.
护士长夏爱梅回答说：“等疫情结束是三四月份，就到了儿童手足口病、疱疹性咽峡炎、百日咳高发的季节了，我们又该忙下一个传染病高峰季了。
"By the end of the epidemic in March and April, we will have a high incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease, herpes simplex pharyngitis and whooping cough," replied the head nurse, Xia Aimei
”征集令阳春三月，万物复苏。
